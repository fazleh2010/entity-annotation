  "text" : "Andalucia is the fourth studio album by Los Angeles rock band Tito & Tarantula, released in 2002. The album marked several line-up changes in the band, which had previously consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist Tito Larriva, lead guitarist Peter Atanasoff, and drummer Johnny \"Vatos\" Hernandez. This album featured the debut of lead guitarist Steven Hufsteter – who had previously played with Larriva in the Cruzados, bassist Io Perry, and keyboardist Marcus Praed. The band toured promoting the album for several years. They also filmed a music video for the song \"California Girl\". However, upon seeing how bad the footage of the video was, Perry threw up, Larriva threatened to quit, and Atanasoff was not seen around for days. So, to compensate, Larriva made his own video for the song using the eight dollars he had in his pocket. In the last 40 seconds of the song \"Effortless\", Larriva, Atanasoff, and Perry can be heard laughing while they watch the \"California Girl\" music video. The song \"La Flor De Mal\" is a cover of a Cruzados song that Larriva and Hufsteter wrote when they were in the Cruzados."

  "text" : "Available in All Colours is the debut album of One Minute Silence, released in 1998. It was released on Big Cat Records, and distributed by 3mv/Pinnacle in the UK, Sony Music in France, Rough Trade in Germany and Austria, M.N.W. in Scandinavia, Record Services in Ireland, P.I.A.S in Benelux and Universal in Italy. It was produced by Machine, and so, although One Minute Silence are a rap metal band, it has a hip hop quality to it. The album features cover artwork by Anne Stokes (the copyright is owned by Big Cat Records, however) which portrays fetuses in orange and green tubes with the labels \"racist\", \"prophet\", \"anarchist\", \"humanitarian\", \"psychopath\", \"dictator\", etc. It is intended as a comment on the isolation of capitalist society and the categorization of individuals. Three songs of Available in All Colors are featured in the 1999 video game Twisted Metal 4; \"South Central\" is played in the opening cinematic, \"A More Violent Approach\" serves as the menu music, and \"And Some Ya Lose\" is used as the sixth level theme (The Oil Rig). All of them are instrumental versions."

  "text" : "Atrocities was Christian Death's fourth album and the first with Valor Kand taking over main duties after Rozz Williams' departure. The album's subject matter deals almost exclusively with the Holocaust including songs about Auschwitz and Josef Mengele. Recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales it also featured the songwriting and arrangement skills of Barry Galvin, who, along with Johann Schumann, would leave the group upon the completion of Atrocities - both went on to form Mephisto Walz."
