Moss won Labor preselection to contest the state seat of Canterbury in 1986 when the appointment of former Labor minister Kevin Stewart as the state's Agent-General in London created the need for a by-election. Canterbury was considered a safe seat for the Labor Party, and Moss was elected with over 53% of the primary vote. He was re-elected four times as the member for Canterbury, and served as a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr government. Moss retired at the 2003 election, and was succeeded by Labor member Linda Burney.",

  "text" : "(This is a Malay name; the name Hashim is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Nasarudin.) Nasarudin Hashim (born 20 July 1950) is a Malaysian politician. A member of the Perak State Legislative Assembly, he is known for his key role in the constitutional crisis in the state in 2009. His defection from the People's Justice Party (PKR) to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)—days after he had defected the other way—helped cause the collapse of the Pakatan Rakyat government of which PKR was a component party. Nasarudin was first elected to the assembly in 2004, as an UMNO member representing the seat of Parit. He was re-elected to the assembly in 2008, albeit for a different seat, Bota. In the 2008 election, the Pakatan Rakyat coalition took power in Perak, consigning Nasarudin's UMNO to opposition for the first time in the state's history. On 25 January 2009, Nasarudin announced his defection to PKR, thus boosting the Pakatan Rakyat's narrow majority in the assembly. He claimed it was a \"brave\" decision that had the support of his constituents. His move was followed by the defection of eight UMNO branches in his constituency. However, in early February, Nasarudin defected back to UMNO. Joined by three other Pakatan Rakyat MPs, the defection gave the UMNO-led Barisan Nasional coalition the numbers to return to government. Nasarudin said his reversal was to ensure the \"stability\" of government in Perak.",

She served as Member of the European Parliament for Tyne South and Wear and Tyne and Wear successively from 1979 to 1989, and entered the House of Commons in the 1987 election as Member of Parliament for Gateshead East. After boundary changes for the 1997 general election, she represented the new Gateshead East and Washington West constituency from 1997 until she stepped down at the 2005 general election and was replaced by Sharon Hodgson. Quin served as prisons minister, Minister for Europe, and as a junior agriculture minister. She asked to retire as a minister in 2001 to concentrate on her constituency interests. She had intended to stand for membership of a North East Regional Assembly on her retirement from Westminster, but the proposed body was rejected by a margin of 4–1 in a referendum in November 2004. In April 2006, it was announced that Quin had been nominated for a life peerage by the Labour Party. On 30 May, she was created Baroness Quin, of Gateshead in the County of Tyne and Wear. In November 2007, she was appointed Chair of the Franco-British Council (British Section). She was appointed a shadow Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister by Harriet Harman in May 2010, and was retained in that role by Ed Miliband after his election as Leader of the Labour Party. She stood down from this position in July 2011. Quin is the grand-niece of Labour Party politician Joshua Ritson (1874–1955).",

Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper. Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His home was in the lane which led to the colliery.",

He has lived there ever since. He studied economics, accounting and financial management externally through the University of New England. At the 2007 New South Wales state election, Williams won the seat of Murray-Darling. His candidacy was boosted by the redistribution prior to the election, which turned the seat from marginal Labor to marginal National. At the election, he defeated incumbent Labor MP Peter Black on a swing of nearly nine percent, turning Murray-Darling into a safe National seat at one stroke. He was handily reelected in 2011, increasing his majority to 17 percent. In July 2014 it was revealed that Williams had verbally attacked then Coalition cabinet minister Robyn Parker with a sexist slur in April 2014, at a meeting in Parliament House during his bid for pre-selection for the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was endorsed as a National Party candidate for the Legislative Council, although in the unwinnable fourth position on the ticket, and was defeated accordingly at the election.

Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

  "text" : "John Lloyd Waddy, OBE, DFC (10 December 1916 – 11 September 1987) was a senior officer and aviator in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and later served as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and Minister of the Crown. As a fighter pilot during World War II, he shot down fifteen enemy aircraft in the Desert War, becoming one of Australia's top-scoring aces and earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. He went on to command No. 80 Squadron in the South West Pacific, where he was awarded the US Air Medal. He was also one of eight senior pilots who took part in the \"Morotai Mutiny\" of April 1945. Discharged from the Permanent Air Force at the end of the war, Waddy took a commission in the RAAF Reserve, leading the organisation as a group captain in the early 1950s. He was active in business and in veterans' groups, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1955. As the Liberal Member for Kirribilli from 1962 to 1976, he held cabinet posts in the New South Wales Parliament, including Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare (later Youth and Community Services), Minister for Health, and Minister for Police and Services. He retired from politics in 1976, and died in 1987 at the age of seventy.",

He was the ninth and youngest son of the reverent. He fought in the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s, and was a Major in the Territorial Army. On 28 April 1868, Hamlin married Sarah Grace Barriball, the daughter of Charles Barriball of Waiuku, at his father's house near Waiuku (Barriball Road in Waiuku commemorates the location of the family's land). Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Remuera on 4 June 1900. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and seven daughters.",

  "text" : "Edmund Barff (5 March 1833 – 29 June 1882) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament from the West Coast, New Zealand. Barff was born in the English county of Kent on 5 March 1833, probably at Lee (now part of Greater London), where he was baptised five months later. He first came to New Zealand to join the West Coast Gold Rush in the mid-1860s. The West Coast was initially part of the Canterbury Province and following a requisition in October 1865, he was first elected as the member of the West Coast Goldfields electorate in the following month. Barff and Evan Prosser, who was elected at the same time, were the first members from the West Coast on the Canterbury Provincial Council. In July 1866, Barff became a member for the Westland electorate. He remained a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council until December 1867. The Westland district separated from the Canterbury Province on 1 January 1868, and Barff joined the Westland County, which was the predecessor to Westland Province. During the existence of Westland County (January 1868 – November 1873), Barff represented the ridings of Westland, Ōkārito, and Arahura. He did not join the Westland Provincial Council, but stood for the first election in January 1874 as one of three candidates in the two-member Arahura electorate (incorrectly referred to as 'Waimea' in some sources). Much to his surprise, he was defeated with 120 votes by Richard Seddon and Houlahan, who were equal at 145 votes. He represented the Westland South electorate in the House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870, when he was defeated for Hokitika by John White. He then represented the Hokitika electorate from 1876 to 1879, when he was again defeated. Barff died in Kumara in 1882; he had never married.",

  "text" : "Elisala Pita OBE (d. 22 August 2016) was a Tuvaluan politician. Pita \"had a long and distinguished career with the Fisheries Department\" in Tuvalu, \"culminating in his being employed as a Fisheries Adviser with the USAID\". For the latter position, he was based in Suva, Fiji. He eventually returned to his home country, and worked in public service, becoming Permanent Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment. In 2001, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, \"for public and community service\". He first entered parliament as an MP for Nukufetau in a by-election in October 2003. At the time, Prime Minister Saufatu Sopoanga was struggling to retain a majority in parliament. There are no political parties in Tuvalu, and Pita was elected without having said which side of parliament he would join. He considered the matter for several days after his election, then joined the government's side, helping it maintain a majority. In August 2004, however, he crossed the floor, providing the Opposition with the majority it needed to topple the government through a motion of no confidence. Over the following weeks, Opposition leader Maatia Toafa and ousted prime minister Saufatu Sopoanga formed an unexpected alliance. Pita seized the opportunity to challenge for the premiership. A vote in parliament on 11 October made Toafa prime minister with eight votes, Sopoanga serving as his deputy. Pita received seven votes, and became the leader of the Opposition. He held the position until the 2006 general election, after which he sat as a backbencher. From 2008 to 2010, as MP, he was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. He lost his seat in parliament in the 2010 general election, with Enele Sopoanga (brother of the former Prime Minister) replacing him. He subsequently served as Chief Executive of the Tuvalu National Private Sector Organisation, lobbying for \"stronger ties between the private sector and the government\". He was selected as the Opposition's candidate for a crucial by-election in Nukufetau on 28 June 2013, which would determine which side of parliament had a majority. Pita pledged, if elected, to enable the Opposition leader Enele Sopoanga, the man who whose election ousted Pita from parliament, to bid for the premiership. He won the seat with more than two thirds of the vote, and the Opposition immediately asked for parliament to be reconvened. After the subsequent vote of no confidence in the government of Willy Telavi, Elisala Pita was appointed Minister for Works and Natural Resources on 5 August 2013 following Enele Sopoaga becoming prime minister. Following the Tuvaluan general election, 2015 Elisala Pita was re-appointed as the Minister for Works and Natural Resources. Pita died on 22 August 2016 in Funafuti.",

  "text" : "William Stewart Loggie (August 10, 1850 – March 13, 1944) was a merchant and politician of the town of Chatham, New Brunswick, Canada. Born in Burnt Church, New Brunswick, Loggie, a dynamic man, built a small empire throughout the Miramichi River area. He bought fish directly from the fishermen, and packed and exported it. As well he operated a large retail business, with hardware, clothing, footwear and grocery stores in Chatham, and general stores in smaller communities in outlying villages. Loggie was also a shipowner and bought and exported lumber. Loggie sat as the Liberal Party of New Brunswick representative in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for the riding of Northumberland from 1903 to 1904 when he resigned to run for the Canadian House of Commons in the general elections of 1904. A Liberal, he represented the riding of Northumberland from 1904 until 1917 when, as a result of the Conscription Crisis he ran for re-election as a Unionist supporting Sir Robert Borden's government. He did not run for re-election in 1921, retiring to private life. When W. S. Loggie died in 1944, his son, J. Kerr Loggie, took over as president of W. S. Loggie and Sons. Kerr's health was failing by 1946 and his brother, Leigh Loggie, returned from the Peace River Country of Alberta where he operated a fur trading business and general store. He operated the company until his death in 1977. As Leigh was a bachelor, the business was wound down at his passing. W. S. Loggie's three-story Victorian Mansion on Wellington Street in Chatham is now a cultural centre.",

  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Channing Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the 1884 election. Jessie Buckland was his son John's daughter.",

  "text" : "Sir Vernon Haddon Treatt KBE, MM, QC (15 May 1897 – 20 September 1984) was an Australian lawyer, soldier, Rhodes Scholar and politician. Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984.",

  "text" : "Lotoala Metia (mort le 21 décembre 2012) est un homme politique tuvaluan. Il est élu une première fois au Fale i Fono (parlement national) lors des élections législatives d'août 2006, en tant que député de Nukufetau. Il est alors nommé ministre des Finances, de la Planification économique et des Industries dans le gouvernement du premier ministre Apisai Ielemia. Il conserve son siège de député lors des élections législatives de 2010, mais le nouveau premier ministre Maatia Toafa ne le reconduit pas au gouvernement. Trois mois plus tard, en décembre, Metia aide Willy Telavi à renverser le gouvernement Toafa par une motion de confiance. Telavi devient premier ministre et nomme Metia ministre des Finances. Le mois suivant, en janvier 2011, des citoyens de sa circonscriptions demandent sa démission, mécontents qu'il ait rejoint le gouvernement Telavi. Une manifestation pacifique a lieu à Funafuti, la capitale ; en réponse, le gouvernement décrète l'état d'urgence et interdit temporairement tout rassemblement de dix personnes ou plus. Des membres du falekaupule de son île, le « puissant conseil des anciens », tentent en vain de le persuade de rejoindre l'Opposition parlementaire et d'aider à porter celle-ci au pouvoir. En septembre 2012, il tombe malade, et passe les mois qui suivent en Nouvelle-Zélande. Il retourne aux Tuvalu pour voter en faveur du budget au Parlement le 13 décembre. Il est admis au centre de soins intensifs de son pays, puis est dépêché aux Fidji le 20 décembre pour y être hospitalisé. Il décède à l'hôpital à Suva le lendemain. La nature de sa maladie n'a pas été rendue publique. Son décès prive le gouvernement Telavi d'une majorité claire au Parlement : il ne dispose plus que de sept sièges, soit autant que l'opposition. Dès lors, le gouvernement ne convoque plus le Parlement. Une élection partielle doit se tenir pour le siège laissé vacant par Metia, à Nukufetau ; Telavi parvient à retarder sa tenue jusqu'à ce qu'une décision de justice le contraigne à permettre cette élection, le 28 juin 2013. Le siège est remporté par le candidat de l'opposition, Elisala Pita. L'opposition demande alors que le Parlement soit convoqué, afin que le gouvernement puisse être destitué par une motion de censure déposée par la nouvelle majorité. S'en suit une crise constitutionnelle, qui aboutit à la chute du gouvernement Telavi.",

  "text" : "Alan Robert Lindsay \"Lin\" Gordon (19 January 1917 – 16 June 2011) was an Australian politician. He was the Labor member for Murrumbidgee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1970 to 1984. He was Minister for Conservation and Water Resources from 1976 to 1981 (with Conservation replaced by Lands and Forests in 1980), Minister for Local Government and Lands from 1981 to 1984, and Minister for Lands and Ports for a few months in 1984. Gordon was born in Cessnock to baker David Irvine Gordon and Mary Mildred Cleary. He was educated at government schools in Cessnock and after graduating was apprenticed to a pharmacy. He attended the University of Sydney, graduating in 1945. On 6 November 1943 he married Valerie Merle Webber, with whom he had five children. He subsequently owned a pharmacy, and also a trotting stud near Leeton. A Roman Catholic, he joined the Australian Labor Party in 1962. In 1965, he was elected to Leeton Shire Council, where he served until 1970 (including a year as President, 1969–1970). When Al Grassby, Labor member for Murrumbidgee, resigned in 1969 to contest the federal seat of Riverina, Gordon was selected as the Labor candidate for the resulting by-election, which took place early in 1970. He easily defeated his Liberal and Country Party opponents. In 1976, he was appointed to the ministry, holding the Conservation and Water Resources portfolios. He briefly served as Acting Minister for Health in 1977, for Local Government in 1978 and for Corrective Services in 1979. In 1980 the Conservation portfolio was split into Lands and Forests, both of which were retained by Gordon. In 1981 his Forests and Water Resources portfolios were exchanged for Local Government, which in turn was exchanged for Ports in 1984. Gordon retired in 1984; his seat was won by National Party candidate Adrian Cruickshank in his absence. Gordon died at his Wagga Wagga home on 16 June 2011.",

  "text" : "Caroline Selina Ganley, CBE, JP (née Blumfield; 16 September 1879 – 3 August 1966) was an English Labour Co-operative Party politician. Ganley was born in Plymouth, the daughter of a tailor. She became politically active in 1906 in opposition to the Boer War, and joined the Social Democratic Federation that year. She actively supported women's suffrage and helped set up what would become the Women's Labour League branch in Battersea. She became involved in the British Committee of the International Congress for Peace and Freedom in 1914. Ganley was a school manager and governor, becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP) in 1920, one of London's first female magistrates. She joined the Labour and Co-operative Parties and served on Battersea Council (1919–25, 1953–65) and the London County Council (1925–29 and 1934–37), and was a member of the London County Education Committee. She contested the Paddington North seat at the 1935 general election. At the 1945 general election, Ganley was elected as Member of Parliament for Battersea South. She narrowly held the seat in 1950 but was defeated by Ernest Partridge in 1951. Ganley was elected a director of the West London Co-operative Society in 1918 and served on the board of its successor, the London Co-operative Society for many years and as President 1942-46, its first woman president. She held national positions in the Women's Co-operative Guild and was one of the speakers at its diamond jubilee celebrations at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943. She was awarded the CBE in 1953.",

In October 2014, she surpassed Kathy Sullivan's record for the longest period of parliamentary service by a woman. From July 2015, Bishop was subject to sustained intense media and public scrutiny regarding her use of parliamentary entitlements, including a helicopter charter to a party fundraiser during her time as speaker. Although Prime Minister Tony Abbott had originally been one of her strongest allies, she eventually lost his support, resigning from the speakership and moving to the backbench on 2 August to be replaced as speaker by Tony Smith. On 16 April 2016, Bishop was defeated by Jason Falinski in a Liberal Party preselection ballot (51 votes to 39) for the Division of Mackellar at the 2016 federal election.",

  "text" : "Brenda Kay Chamberlain, PC (born April 9, 1952 in Toronto, Ontario) was a member of the Canadian House of Commons, representing the riding of Guelph for the Liberal Party from 1993 until her resignation as of April, 2008. Chamberlain was a home daycare owner and operator from 1979 to 1983, and served as the administrative assistant in a family-owned business from 1984 to 1987. She also served as Executive Director of the Wellington County Literacy Council from 1989 to 1993, and of the Guelph-Wellington Career Educational Council from 1992 to 1993. During this time she also served on the Wellington County Board of Education (1985–1993). Chamberlain sought the federal Liberal nomination in Guelph-Wellington in 1992. Chamberlain's main challenger for the nomination was to be former Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Maine, who represented Guelph in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979. Maine dropped out of the race after the riding's nomination meeting was scheduled for an early date, arguing that this favoured Chamberlain. Chamberlain went on to win the Liberal nomination by acclamation. Maine later decided to run as an independent candidate against Chamberlain in the 1993 federal election. Chamberlain was elected handily as the Liberals took all but one of Ontario's 101 seats—the closest any party has come to sweeping the country's biggest province at the federal level. Chamberlain was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1997 and 2000. For many years, she was known as a strong supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party. Chamberlain won another easy victory in the election of 2004, defeating her Conservative opponent by nearly 10,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Guelph. Chamberlain was elected a fifth time in the election of 2006, in which the Conservative Party won a national minority government. She was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and was a vocal opponent of her own party's plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Chamberlain also voted against her party's same-sex marriage bill in 2005. She was also involved in legislation which forced Bell Canada to revise its 411 billing policy. Chamberlain served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour from 1997 to 1999, and was parliamentary secretary to the president of the Queen's Privy Council, with special emphasis on public service reform and Métis and Non-Status Indians, from December 2003 to July 2004. Although opposition spread rumours that she was about to retire she stood for re-election in 2006 and won handily. Just over two years later, on March 7, 2008, Chamberlain announced her resignation from the House of Commons effective April 7. She did not provide a reason for her resignation. During that election and thereafter the Guelph Mercury subjected Chamberlain to increasing degrees of criticism. Hansard will show that Chamberlain's last official votes occurred during the finals of weeks of February 2008. Subsequently, in a 2008 by-election Liberal candidate Frank Valeriote was elected in the Guelph riding. Brenda Chamberlain served locally as a school trustee and federally as a Member of the House of Commons. She was elected for twenty-four consecutive years of public service.",

Born in Richmond, British Columbia, Ringma served in the Canadian Forces, serving during the Korean War. He attained the rank of Major General before leaving the military in 1983. His military experiences in Korea, particularly with the Mobile Laundry and Bath Unit (MLBU), are recounted in his book MLBU Full Monty in Korea (ISBN 1-894263-85-5). He was elected in the Nanaimo—Cowichan electoral district for the Reform Party in the 1993 general election. In 1996, he attracted controversy when he stated in a newspaper interview that store owners should be free to move gays and blacks \"to the back of the shop\", or even to fire them, if the presence of that individual offended a bigoted customer. Ringma was suspended from the Reform Party caucus for several months after fellow MP Jan Brown spoke out against the prominence of extremist views in the party (although Brown herself was also suspended.) Ringma left politics after serving in the 35th Canadian Parliament and retired to Thetis Island, British Columbia. Ringma had three children with his wife Paula MacDowell. He died on 31 March 2014, aged 85.",

  "text" : "Taom Tanukale is a Tuvaluan politician. He began his career in national politics when he was elected to Parliament in a by-election in May 2005, as MP for Nui, following the death of his predecessor. He joined Prime Minister Maatia Toafa's parliamentary majority, and was appointed acting Minister for Health and Education, \"while the incumbent went overseas for long-term medical treatment\". He failed to retain his seat in the August 2006 general election, but regained it in the September 2010 general election. In December of that year, Prime Minister Maatia Toafa was ousted in a motion of no confidence. Tanukale supported Toafa's opponent, Willy Telavi, who became Prime Minister and appointed him as Minister for Health. On 30 July 2013, as the government appeared to have lost its parliamentary majority and was about to face a motion of no confidence, Tanukale unexpectedly resigned from Parliament (and thus also from the government) altogether. The following day, the reason for his resignation became apparent. The Speaker, Kamuta Latasi, rejected the Opposition's attempt to table a motion of no confidence, on the grounds that there was now a vacant seat in Parliament. Latasi adjourned Parliament, and ruled that it would not reconvene until a by-election had been held - thus prolonging Telavi's minority government. This tactic proved fruitless as Governor General Sir Iakoba Italeli intervened on 1 August 2013 and removed Telavi from office, so as to enable Parliament to function. The following day, Parliament (minus Tanukale) formally brought down the government through a vote of no confidence. Taom Tanukale was a candidate in the Nui by-election, 2013, which was held on 10 September. Tanukale came third in the poll with 160 votes. Leneuoti Matusi was declared the winner, polling 297 of the 778 registered voters. Tanukale was a candidate in the Tuvaluan general election, 2015 and received 53 votes, but was not elected to parliament.",

Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, he emigrated to Canada with his wife in 1891 settling in Nanaimo, British Columbia. A miner by trade, Smith was a moderate trade unionist in Nanaimo. In 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate \"Liberal-Labour\" platform. He ran for Vancouver's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power. Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. Ralph Smith was a supporter of women's suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed.",

Tan Sri Rafidah binti Aziz (born 4 November 1943) is a Malaysian politician who was Member of Parliament for the Kuala Kangsar constituency from 1986 to 2013. Born in Kuala Kangsar, Perak, Rafidah was Minister of International Trade and Industry from 1987 to 2008. As minister, she was the chairman of MATRADE beginning in 1991. Rafidah was the head of United Malays National Organisation's Woman Wing (Wanita UMNO in Malay) from 1999 to 2009, before losing out in the 2009 UMNO General Assembly election to Shahrizat Abdul Jalil after seeking re-election for another term. In 2006, Rafidah was accused of corruption related to the issuance of Approved Permits (AP) for importing foreign vehicles by former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad in his series of criticisms against the Government of Malaysia. Mahathir had also criticised then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's handling of the Approved Permits (AP) issue, expressing his surprise that Rafidah was still retained as a Cabinet member although two people on the list of persons issued with highest number of APs were linked to her. In March 2008, following the general election held in that month, Rafidah was dropped from cabinet, despite winning her parliamentary seat when other ministers had lost theirs. After thirty two years in government service, and twenty years as a minister, she described herself as being \"blessed and content.\" When asked if she was saddened, she said that she wished Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had told her earlier on not to contest the election. Rafidah was an active member in the Malaysian political scene, having previously been appointed as a Member of the Malaysian Parliament. She was appointed as Senator in 1974 and resigned to contest in the General Elections in 1978. She served as Member of Parliament in the Selayang Constituency (from 1978 to 1982) and Kuala Kangsar Constituency (from 1982 to 2013). She served in the UMNO Supreme Council for 38 years since winning a seat in the council in 1975. She is Malaysia's longest-serving Minister of International Trade and Industry, having served in that capacity from 1987 to 2008. Previously, she also hold the portfolio of Minister of Public Enterprises from 1980 to 1987 and Deputy Minister of Finance from 1977 to 1980. In 1976, she was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Public Enterprises. Rafidah also had experience lecturing at the faculty of Economics and Administration at the University of Malaya. She started her career as a tutor and lecturer in the Faculty of Economics, University of Malaya from 1966 to 1976. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1966 and a Masters degree in Economics in 1970, both from the same university. Rafidah currently serves as the Non-Executive Independent Chairman and Director of AirAsia X since March 3, 2011. She is also the Chairman of Supermax Corporation Berhad since June 16, 2015.",

He has been an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives since August 2010, representing the electorate of McEwen. He was previously a member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2006. Mitchell was born in Melbourne, Victoria. He was a Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2006, representing Central Highlands Province. He stood unsuccessfully for the province as the Labor candidate at 1999 Victorian state election, before winning it at his next attempt at the 2002 state election. The province was abolished in 2006 with the reform of the Legislative Council. Mitchell stood unsuccessfully as the Labor candidate for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Benalla at the 2006 state election. At the 2007 federal election, Mitchell was the Labor candidate for the seat of McEwen, a hybrid urban-rural seat encompassing Labor-friendly territory in north Melbourne and more conservative rural areas to the north of the capital. He had initially been announced as the winning candidate, defeating the sitting Liberal member Fran Bailey by a mere seven votes. However, after a recount this margin was reduced to five. A subsequent recount requested by the Liberal Party, overturned this result with Mitchell instead losing by 12 votes. The Court of Disputed Returns later increased this margin to 27 votes on the basis of handwriting skills. Mitchell won McEwen following Bailey's retirement at the 2010 federal election. Mitchell's win was one of only two gains for Labor at the election. Ahead of the 2013 federal election, McEwen was pushed further into Melbourne, technically making McEwen a safe Labor seat. However, Mitchell suffered a nine-point swing against former Liberal MLC Donna Petrovich, ultimately picking up enough postal votes to narrowly retain his seat on preferences.",

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice and Howden, Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, having previously been Minister of State at the Foreign Office from July 1994 to April 1997. Davis was raised on Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, South West London. After attending Bec Grammar School in Tooting, London, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with Tate & Lyle. Entering Parliament in 1987 at the age of 38 for the Boothferry constituency, in his subsequent political career he held the positions of Conservative party chairman and Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the shadow cabinet, under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and then second. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary. This was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP in June 2008, he officially became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won it in July 2008. In 2010, Davis was invited by Prime Minister David Cameron to join the cabinet of his coalition government, but he declined and stayed on the backbenches. In July 2016, following the UK voting to leave the European Union, Davis was appointed by Theresa May as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.",

He was the Country Liberal Party member for Solomon in the Australian House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, and then served in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly as the member for Fong Lim from 2008 to 2016. He was the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory under chief minister Adam Giles from 2013 to 2014. Tollner was born in Biloela, Queensland, and worked as a manager and company director before entering politics. He contested the 1997 territory election as an independent, narrowly losing to CLP candidate Chris Lugg in the seat of Nelson. He subsequently won the new federal seat of Solomon for the CLP at the 2001 federal election, and was re-elected at the 2004 election. He was narrowly defeated by Labor candidate Damian Hale at the 2007 election. Tollner then contested the 2008 territory election, winning the new seat of Fong Lim and defeating Labor minister Matthew Bonson. He was re-elected at the 2012 election, and upon the CLP's victory was appointed Minister for Health, Minister for Alcohol Rehabilitation and Policy, and Minister for Housing. In March 2013, Mills expelled Tollner from his cabinet after a heated disagreement between the two at a party meeting. According to former MLA Daryl Manzie, Tollner swore at Mills and threw a stack of cabinet papers at him before walking out of the room. Tollner was appointed deputy chief minister of the Northern Territory on 13 March 2013. He caused controversy in August 2014 when he referred to the gay son of fellow CLP MP Gary Higgins as a \"pillow biter\" and \"shirt lifter\". As a result, it was announced that Tollner's resignation as deputy leader of the CLP had been accepted. Despite that, Tollner said a few days later that he wanted to be restored to his former position or he would quit the party, leaving it in a precarious position on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. On 1 September, Chief Minister Adam Giles threw open the leadership and deputy leadership to a party room ballot. Giles was re-elected as CLP leader, and Peter Chandler was voted in as his deputy. A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election all but erased Tollner's majority in Fong Lim, slashing it from a fairly safe 7.3 percent to an extremely marginal 0.2 percent. Tollner tried to transfer to the newly created seat of Spillett, which had absorbed much of the eastern portion of Fong Lim. However, he lost a November 2015 preselection battle to Lia Finocchiaro, the member for neighbouring Drysdale. His senior advisor, Tim Dixon, was pre-selected for Fong Lim, but lost the seat to Labor.",

  "text" : "Sir Richard Dawson Bates, 1st Baronet OBE PC JP DL (23 November 1876 – 10 June 1949), known as Dawson Bates, was an Ulster Unionist Party member of the Northern Ireland House of Commons. He was born in Strandtown, Belfast, the son of Richard Dawson Bates, solicitor and Clerk of the Crown, and Mary Dill. His paternal grandfather, John Bates (d. 1855), had been a minor figure in the Conservative Party in Belfast, before his duties were discharged on a Chancery Court ruling of maladministration. Bates was educated at Coleraine Academical Institution. After studying at Queen's College, Belfast, became a solicitor in 1900, in 1908 founding a firm with his uncle - E and R.D. Bates, later R.B.Uprichard would be apprenticed, become a partner and eventually take over the firm of E and R.D. Bates and Uprichard, as Crown Solicitor. In 1906 Bates was appointed Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council. During this time, he was instrumental in the events of Ulster Day and in the formation of the UVF, organised the Larne gun-running and supported the formation of the Ulster Unionist Labour Association to counter socialism. He toured Northern Ireland, working hard to build up the Unionist Party, while portraying all Roman Catholics as traitors. Bates stood down as Secretary on his election to Stormont in 1921, where he represented first East Belfast and later Belfast Victoria. In the government of Sir James Craig he was the first Minister for Home Affairs and a member of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland. He introduced the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, but opposed the Ulster Protestant Association. Under his administration, he was accused of gerrymandering, and of intervening to ensure that prison sentences were not imposed on Protestants who attacked Catholics. Bates was also a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of County Down. He married Jessie Muriel Cleland, daughter of Sir Charles John Cleland. They had one son, Major Sir John Dawson Bates, 2nd Baronet(an Oxford-educated Wykehamist, d. 1998). He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1919 New Year Honours, Knight Bachelor in 1921 and was made a baronet of Magherabuoy, near Portrush, in County Londonderry on 7 June 1937. In his retirement strained financial circumstances and security (he constantly required a police escort) led him to rent Butleigh House, near Glastonbury, Somerset. It was here he died in 1949; Sir Dawson's body was flown back to Ulster for burial at Ballywillan Church of Ireland. Bates was a director and president of Glentoran Football Club.",

He represented the Southern Maori electorate from 1871 to February 1879, when he appointed to the Legislative Council. He was disqualified from the Legislative Council in August 1880 over a technicality, which caused bitterness and resentment among Māori. In 1881 Ihaia Tainui who had held the electorate since 1879 resigned so that Taiaroa could resume the electorate. Taiaroa then held the electorate from 1881 to 1885 when he was again appointed to the Legislative Council, where he served for 20 years until his death. Taiaroa was active in pursuing Ngāi Tahu land claims in Parliament.

He was president and financial secretary of the South Australian Masons and Bricklayers' Society, and was their delegate to the Trades and Labour Council, of which he was also president and vice-president. Chesson also served on the Adelaide Trades Hall management committee and Eight Hours Committee, and as president and vice-president of the United Labor Party. Chesson was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1905 election in the seat of Port Adelaide, shifting to the new seat of West Torrens following an electoral redistribution in 1915. He was chairman of committees from 1915 to 1918. Chesson left the Labor Party for the new National Party in the 1917 Labor split over conscription. He was defeated by a Labor candidate when he ran for re-election at the 1918 election. After leaving politics, he was clerk of works in the department of the Architect-in-Chief.

Labor was defeated at the 1993 state election and Taylor became Leader of the Opposition in February 1994 when Lawrence resigned to enter federal parliament. He was succeeded by Jim McGinty in October. In 1996 he resigned to contest the federal seat of Kalgoorlie against Labor rebel Graeme Campbell, who defeated him as an independent. He was the first WA Labor leader in decades not to take the party into an election.

  "text" : "Tauveve O’Love Jacobsen is a Niuean politician and diplomat. She is currently Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand, after serving as a member of the Niue Assembly (national Parliament) and a minister in Toke Talagi's government. She was previously a long-standing leading figure in the informal parliamentary Opposition to Young Vivian's government. She was, from 2008 to 2011, Minister of Health, Minister of Public Works, Minister of Women’s Affairs, and Minister in charge of the Niue Power Corporation. She had previously been Minister of Education, Health, Environment, Training and Development. Additionally, Jacobsen is a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and Patroness of the Niuean Volleyball Association. Following the 1999 general election, she was a candidate for the post of Premier (head of government), who is selected by the national Assembly. She lost to Sani Lakatani, of the Niue People's Party, by six votes to fourteen. Following the 2005 general election, Jacobsen was Young Vivian's only opponent contending for the position of Premier. She was defeated by three votes to seventeen. Vivian thanked her for competing against him: \"That the selection was contested, thanks to Ekepule [member of the Assembly] O’love Jacobsen, confirms our determination under the Westminster system of government to adhere and uphold one of the fundamental principles of democracy.\" In February 2008, Jacobsen stated that landowners had been bullied into authorising the building of a hotel and golf course on their land, a project supported by the government and funded by Chinese investors. Premier Young Vivian rejected the allegation. In the lead-up to the 2008 general election, which saw her successfully retain her seat in the Assembly (as a common roll representative, Jacobsen was critical of the fact that several members of the Assembly would be re-elected unopposed. She accused Vivian of discouraging people from taking part in the election as Opposition candidates, and argued that a democracy requires voters being able to choose between several candidates in each constituency. \"If the principle of democracy is going to be upheld, then it is very important that people do need to go to the polls and not have them unopposed and become duly elected.\" Vivian rejected Jacobsen's criticism, and argued in return that candidates were chosen within the villages, in traditional ways. With such a practice, he said, \"there is no conflict, there’s peace and togetherness.\" A government news publication stated with thinly veiled criticism that Jacobsen \"saw herself as a self-appointed backbench champion of the masses\". Following the election, Jacobsen supported Toke Talagi's candidacy to prime ministership, against Vivian, and was appointed to Talagi's small Cabinet. In March 2011, she resigned from government and from the Assembly to be appointed Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand.",

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Ewan Murray Robson CBE, DSO (7 March 1906 – 26 August 1974) was an Australian lawyer, soldier and a member of the New south Wales Parliament for over twenty years. Known for most of his life as Murray Robson, he was born in Sydney and educated at Newington College and the University of Sydney, where he gained degrees in arts and law. After working several years as a Solicitor, Robson stood for, and was elected to, parliament on 29 August 1936 at a by-election for the seat of Vaucluse. He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the Second World War and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to lieutenant colonel and receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service. Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1945. When long-time Leader Vernon Treatt resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader Robert Askin and Pat Morton became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974.",

Membre de l’iwi (tribu) Te Ati Haunui-a-Paparangi dans la région de Wanganui, il s'implique dans les années 1850 dans les médiations pour ramener la paix dans cette région affectée par de violents conflits territoriaux inter-tribaux. Dans le même temps il participe à des réunions du mouvement Kingitanga, mais pour y exprimer son opposition au mouvement : le Kingitanga affirme son indépendance vis-à-vis des autorités coloniales, tandis que Mete Paetahi est partisan de la souveraineté britannique en Nouvelle-Zélande. Il s'oppose aussi au soulèvement de la secte Pai Marire dans les années 1860, et se joint aux forces maori pro-britanniques qui le combattent. Il prend part à la bataille de Moutoa le 14 mai 1864. Il fournit au gouvernement colonial d'importantes recommandations tactiques dans le conflit, et participe à la bataille d'Ohoutahi en février 1865, puis à l'expédition militaire des forces gouvernementales dans le Taranaki en janvier et février 1866. En 1868 se tiennent les premières élections pour des sièges réservés aux Maori à la Chambre des représentants. Seul candidat dans la circonscription couvrant l'ouest du pays, Paetahi est déclaré élu. Un mois après son entrée au Parlement en mai, les forces coloniales font à nouveau face à une résistance maori armée : l’iwi Ngati Ruanui, sous son chef Titokowaru, se soulève en réponse à des confiscations de terres. Mete Paetahi, s'exprimant au Parlement, incite le gouvernement à répondre avec fermeté, soulignant les exactions commises par les rebelles. La même année, il succède au statut de chef de plus haut rang des tribus du sud du Wanganui. Il perd son siège de député aux élections de 1871. Il ne participe dès lors plus à la vie politique coloniale, mais prend part dans les années 1870 à des réunions inter-tribales maori pour discuter de la représentation politique des Maori, et de l'attitude à adopter sur la question des terres. Il est généralement favorable à l'idée de vendre des terres aux colons, tant que les tribus en conservent suffisamment pour vivre. Il se consacre par ailleurs à l'élevage de moutons qu'il acquiert en 1877. Il meurt à l'âge d'environ 70 ans, et les autorités coloniales l'honorent de funérailles militaires, en reconnaissance de ses services durant les Guerres maories.",

She was elected to State Parliament in the 1997 state election. Hailing from the Socialist Left faction of the Australian Labor Party, Bedford has described herself as being South Australia's most left-wing MP. Her support for the Relationships Bill 2005, a bill which extends legal protections to same-sex couples, has made her a target of fundamentalist groups. Her opinions are considered by some as being incompatible with the opinions of her 'bible belt' electorate. Despite this, she was returned at the 2006 state election with a swing of more than 10 points (two-party-preferred), exceeding the statewide swing to the Labor government and defeating her Liberal opponent Pat Trainor, a former pastor in the Assemblies of God. As of the 2014 state election, Bedford holds Florey with a margin of 2.5 points.",

He was the younger brother of poet William Caldwell Roscoe and the grandson of English historian and writer William Roscoe. In 1864, he married Anna Letitia Le Breton. Roscoe was a partner in several hardware and ironware ventures. In 1870, he became the Commissioner of Savings Banks for the British Columbia colony. Roscoe stood for election as an Independent Liberal candidate in the Canadian federal election in 1874 in the two-member Victoria riding. He placed second in a close three-way race and was elected along with Liberal incumbent Amor De Cosmos. Roscoe did not stand for re-election in 1878 and died later in the year in Victoria at the age of 47. He was replaced in the seat by incoming Prime Minister John A. Macdonald who had lost his Ontario seat earlier as the BC portion of the election was delayed, and because he was deemed unelectable in eastern Canada due to ongoing politics surrounding his role in the Pacific Scandal. Roscoe's Victoria home is today preserved by The Land Conservancy of BC as a rare example of a pre-Confederation colonial house.",

Wriedt is the daughter of former state Labor leader and Whitlam Government Minister for Agriculture Ken Wriedt. Wriedt was appointed Minister for Education in 1998, becoming the youngest ever female member of Cabinet in Tasmania. As Education Minister, in December 2000, she launched \"Learning Together\", a major policy on education, training and information provision for the state of Tasmania. Learning Together promised a complete overhaul of the state's education system, introducing the Essential Learnings Curriculum as a trial way to assess and teach students. Wriedt also funded the establishment of a number of child care centres co-located with government primary schools, and saw the raising of Tasmania's school leaving age from 16 to 17 years. In 2002 she also became Minister for Women. In 2005, Wriedt initiated the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women to recognise the significant contribution that women have made to Tasmania throughout history. In the 2006 Tasmanian state election Wriedt suffered a decline in her primary vote, almost losing her seat to Liberal challenger Vanessa Goodwin, after criticism of the government over the Essential Learnings Curriculum. After the election, she became Minister for Tourism, Arts and the Environment, while David Bartlett assumed her Education portfolio. Following a cabinet reshuffle in January 2008, Wriedt was appointed Minister for Economic Development and Tourism.",

Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999.",

Following his resignation he said: Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.\" He opposed Australia's contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government and ran for Parliament against John Howard as a Green's Candidate in 2004. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a \"lie\". Since 2003 he has been active in Australian politics. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences. Wilkie finished first on the primary vote at the 2013 federal election and increased his margin.",

  "text" : "Adrian John Cruickshank (16 December 1936 – 21 May 2010) was an Australian politician and philanthropist. He was the National Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Murrumbidgee from 1984 to 1999. Cruickshank was born in Hobart, Tasmania. He spent time in southern and eastern Africa as a miner and prospector before returning to Australia to farm. In 1966, he became New South Wales State Chairman of the Young Australian Country Party, holding the position until 1968 when he was appointed to the state council, serving until 1984. He was elected to Carrathool Shire Council in 1970 and remained until 1974. He was chairman of the Rankins Springs branch of the party from 1972 to 1984. In 1984, Cruickshank was selected as the National candidate for the state seat of Murrumbidgee, which was being vacated by sitting Labor member Lin Gordon. Cruickshank finished third on the primary votes behind Labor candidate Margaret Delves and independent Thomas Marriott, but with Liberal preferences pushed into second place and was elected the victor on Marriott's preferences, with a margin of 51.52%. Partly due to redistributions which greatly strengthened the National Party in Murrumbidgee, Cruickshank faced no further serious challenges and was re-elected in 1988, 1991, and 1995. He retired in 1999 and was succeeded as National MP for the seat by Adrian Piccoli. On 21 May 2010, Cruickshank died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from pneumonia.",

He is currently the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Kalabakan constituency in Sabah, representing the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in the governing Barisan Nasional coalition. Before entering federal politics, Abdul Ghapur was active in Sabah state politics, initially as a member of the Sabah People's United Front (commonly known as BERJAYA). He joined UMNO when it moved into the state in the early 1990s and was a Deputy Chief Minister in the Barisan Nasional state government between 1995 and 1997. He was elected unopposed to federal Parliament in 2004, for the newly created seat of Kalabakan on the border between Malaysia and Indonesia in East Sabah. In 2008, after his reelection (again unopposed), he was appointed as a Deputy Minister for Resources and Natural Environment by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, only to resign eight days later. Later that year he openly criticised the Barisan Nasional government in Parliament for overlooking the needs states of Sabah and Sarawak, which had voted resoundingly in favour of Barisan Nasional in the 2008 election. He again spoke out against the federal government for what he considered to be its slow response to the invasion of part of East Sabah by Filipino militants in 2013. At the same time, he criticsed UMNO's internal election process as being open to corruption, claiming that \"people will do anything just to get on the Supreme Council even if it’s very expensive\".",
