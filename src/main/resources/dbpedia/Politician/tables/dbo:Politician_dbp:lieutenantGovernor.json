He was born in Wales, and educated in the United Kingdom and Ireland. He immigrated to Canada in 1967 and was a noted family physician in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. He became the mayor of Dartmouth in 1985, and won re-election twice. He then became the leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in 1992 and stepped down as mayor. In 1993, he defeated the incumbent provincial government and became premier. Savage was a controversial premier, bringing in many reforms in taxation, regional government, and government hiring practices. He resigned as premier in 1997 due to his low approval ratings in public polls. He died of cancer at the age of 70 in 2003. He was the father of Mike Savage, current mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality.",

  "text" : "Joseph Roberts \"Joey\" Smallwood, PC, CC (December 24, 1900 – December 17, 1991) was a politician from Newfoundland, Canada. He was the main force that brought the Dominion of Newfoundland into the Canadian confederation in 1949, becoming the first Premier of Newfoundland, serving until 1972. As premier, he vigorously promoted economic development, championed the welfare state, and emphasized modernization of education and transportation. Smallwood abandoned his youthful socialism and collaborated with bankers, turning against the militant unions that sponsored numerous strikes. The results of his efforts to promote industrialization were mixed, with the most favourable results in hydroelectricity, iron mining and paper mills. Smallwood was charismatic and controversial. Never shy, he dubbed himself \"the last Father of Confederation.\" While many Canadians today remember Smallwood as the man who brought Newfoundland into the Canadian Confederation, the opinion held by Newfoundlanders and their diaspora remains sharply divided as to his legacy.",

  "text" : "John Kent (1805 in Wexford, Ireland – September 1, 1872 in St. John's, Newfoundland), arrived in Newfoundland in 1820 and started working for his uncle Patrick Morris. He was influential in establishing a large Irish population on the island. He was elected to the first House of Assembly in 1832 as a Liberal. John Kent was a champion of Catholic rights on an island that was deeply divided along religious lines. He worked for the reform movement along with William Carson and Morris that successfully persuaded the British Colonial Office to institute responsible government in Newfoundland. Kent became Colonial Secretary under Philip Francis Little. From 1848 to 1855 he was Speaker of the Newfoundland House of Assembly. He became Premier after Little resigned in 1858. He won the election of 1859 but his government was engulfed by crisis in 1861 when it tried to lower the salary of (mostly Protestant) government officials, including judges who sued the government. In the legislature Kent accused Governor Sir Alexander Bannerman and the opposition Conservatives of conspiring with the judges against the government. Bannerman responded by dismissing the Kent's government in March 1861 and installing Hugh Hoyles as Premier of a Conservative government. The Liberals defeated the Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence resulting in an election campaign that was fought along sectarian lines with Catholics largely voting Liberal and Protestants largely voting Conservative. The Protestant Conservative Party of Newfoundland narrowly defeated Kent's Liberals and riots erupted in Catholic Harbour Grace when the governor cancelled voting there essentially denying the Liberals two seats in the legislature and allowing the Conservatives to have a legislative majority. Kent later joined Sir Frederick Carter's coalition government that attempted to heal the rifts and create a cross denominational compromise that allowed power sharing between Catholics and Protestants, the funding of all denominational schools and the creation of political parties that included members of all denominations.",

Wells est d'abord entré en politique en 1966 lorsqu'il fut élu à la Chambre d'Assemblée en tant que député libéral, servant dans le cabinet de Joey Smallwood jusqu'en 1968 lorsqu'il démissionna pour protester contre le caractère autoritaire de Smallwood. Wells quitta la politique en 1971 et revint à sa pratique légale, ayant développé une expertise en droit constitutionnel. En 1987, il fit son retour dans la scène politique pour être élu chef des libéraux, qui étaient restés dans les bancs de l'Opposition pendant plus d'une décennie. En 1989, il mena son parti à la victoire, mettant fin à dix-sept années de gouvernement par les conservateurs. En tant que premier ministre, Wells s'est opposé à l'accord du lac Meech, s'objectant à la provision légale de société distincte pour le Québec. Wells permit à la Chambre d'Assemblée de voter sur l'accord, mais lorsque l'opposition d'Elijah Harper au Manitoba empêcha la ratification par sa province, Wells annula le vote planifié. Wells comprima le budget provincial et tenta de privatiser le service hydro-électrique détenu par la province, mais il ne put aller devant avec la privatisation en raison d'une forte opposition populaire. Wells démissionna de son poste de premier ministre en 1996. Le premier ministre Jean Chrétien le nomma chef de la cour d'appel (en) de Terre-Neuve en 1998.",

Before entering politics Williams was a highly successful lawyer and businessman.After becoming Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001, he was elected to the House of Assembly in a by-election for the district of Humber West in Corner Brook. Williams' premiership was considered controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador. Events such as ordering all Canadian flags to be removed from provincial government buildings, and launching the Anything But Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election, garnered national attention. While Williams remains a controversial politician outside Newfoundland and Labrador, he was continuously ranked as one of the most popular premiers in Canada, with approval ratings in the province consistently in the high seventies and eighties.",

He went on to study law and was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1861. In that same year, he married Emily Myers Wetmore. He served as a school trustee for several years and was clerk for the Westmorland County court from 1867 to 1870. Hanington ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature for Westmorland in 1870 but was elected in an 1870 by-election as a Liberal-Conservative. He was defeated in 1874 then regained his seat in 1878 and entered the cabinet of Premier John James Fraser as minister without portfolio and succeeded Fraser as premier in 1882. Hanington was sympathetic to Acadian rights and appointed a member of that community, Pierre-Amand Landry, to the senior cabinet position of provincial secretary. However, Hanington faced a leader of the opposition, Andrew G. Blair who had organised the Liberal Party into a powerful force. In 1883, Blair defeated Hanington's Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence and won the subsequent election. Hanington continued as leader of the opposition but was unable to defeat Blair's Liberals in the 1886 election. He remained in the legislature until 1896 when he accepted an appointment to the bench as a member of the province's Supreme Court. He was the presiding judge at the last trial of Tom Collins.",

  "text" : "Sir Hugh Hoyles (born October 17, 1814) was a politician and lawyer who served as the third premier of the Newfoundland Colony. Hoyles was the first premier of Newfoundland to have been born in the colony, and served from 1861 to 1865. Born in St. John's, he was the son of Newman Hoyles, the first leader of the Tory Party. Educated in Nova Scotia Hoyles trained as a lawyer and returned to St John's in 1842, quickly establishing a large and lucrative legal practice. He was eminent in the Natives' Society and the Newfoundland Church Society. Hoyles was elected to the Assembly in 1848. He rapidly became the Conservative leader, opposing responsible government, on the grounds that the colony was not ready for it, and throwing his weight behind Bishop Feild's campaign to divide the Protestant educational grant and put Anglicans on the same footing as Catholics. This proposal alienated Methodists who thereupon voted for the Catholic Liberal Party so that, in the 1855 election, the first after responsible government, Hoyles found himself leader of the Opposition. Even though he dropped his support for Feild, and adopted a more pan-Protestant stance, he still unsuccessful in the election of 1859. In 1861, his chance came when he was hired as a lawyer by senior judges to fight Premier John Kent's plans to reduce their salaries. When Kent accused the judges, the governor and the Conservatives of conspiracy the Governor fired Kent and appointed Hoyles as the new Premier. Hoyles' government was defeated in the legislature and had to fight an election in a highly charged sectarian atmosphere which resulted in riots when the Conservatives won the election. During his term as premier, he tried to cool down sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants by inviting Catholics to join his administration and distributing all patronage fairly between religious groups. He also sent delegates to the Canadian Confederation Conference at Quebec in 1864. Newfoundland had not been invited to Charlottetown. Those delegates, Ambrose Shea for the opposition, and Frederick Carter, for the government, did not have the power to negotiate. Hoyles decided to leave office in 1865, before the crucial 1869 election which decided the fate of Confederation with Canada. He was succeeded by Sir Frederick Carter. Hoyles was appointed Chief Justice of Newfoundland, a post which he filled with great distinction. He retired to Halifax in 1880 to live with his married daughter. He died on February 1, 1888. D.W. Prowse, the nineteenth century Newfoundland historian, comments that \"we are all proud of Sir Hugh as the most distinguished Newfoundlander of our day\".",

  "text" : "Philip Francis Little (1824 – October 21, 1897) was the first Premier of Newfoundland Colony between 1855 and 1858. He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law. He got involved in politics only a few years after. He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland's first Premier in 1855 and served concurrently as the colony's Attorney-General. Little only remained in office until July 15, 1858, when he resigned to be succeeded by John Kent. In that time, he managed to secure Newfoundland's autonomy, in making sure Newfoundland had a say over its own destiny. Then Britain and France came with a plan involving the west coast of Newfoundland. Little objected and in a dispatch in 1857, the British cancelled the deal which would have been unfavourable to Newfoundland. He resigned in 1858 saying \"I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me\". He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife. Little was appointed as appointed assistant justice on the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in September 1858 and became Chief Justice two months later. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, as Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. He married into a wealthy Anglo-Irish family in 1864 and retired to Ireland in 1868 and did a great deal for the home rule movement there. He died at the age of 73 in 1897 while living in Monkstown, Ireland. He married Mary Jane Holdright in 1864 and they had 13 children. Their youngest child Patrick Little was a senior Irish politician.",

  "text" : "Andrew Rainsford Wetmore (August 16, 1820 – March 7, 1892) was a New Brunswick politician, jurist, and a member of a prominent United Empire Loyalist family. Wetmore entered politics in 1865 with his election to the colonial legislature as an Anti-Confederate. His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands. On May 25, 1870 he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court.",
