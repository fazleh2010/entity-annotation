He was also Member of the Managing Committee and General Council of Rajkumar College; Member of the Executive Body of the Bihar War Committee.

Maharajkumar Singha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal in 1936. They had a son, Indra Jitendra Narain Singh. He entered politics in 1946 following the formal accession of the Ramgarh state into the Indian Republic. In 1952 Bihar Assembly elections, he contested from Dhanbad as a candidate of Swatantra Party but was defeated by a noted freedom-fighter and labor rights leader, Purushottam K. Chauhan. Later in the Bihar Assembly Elections of 1967, serious opposition was offered by the Raja Bahadur's Swatantra Party to the ruling Congress government. The Raja Bahadur and his younger brother, Dr. Basant Narayan Singh, became Cabinet Ministers in the government headed by Chief Minister of Bihar, Mahamaya Prasad Sinha. He resigned from the party because he was not made the Deputy Chief Minister. In late 1960s, Kamakhya Narayan Singh was popularly an aspirant for Rajput supremacy in Bihar against Rajput stalwart, Sri Satyendra Narain Singh (then known as \"Coming Chief Minister of Bihar\") but was outmanoeuvred. His party later merged with the Janata party. Many of his family members became important political functionaries and legislators.",

Er war der Kandidat für einen Senatssitz von Connecticut bei den Senatswahlen vom 7. November 2006. In den parteiinternen Vorwahlen, die die Kandidatur festlegen, besiegte er den Amtsinhaber Joe Lieberman. Lamont ist Erbe eines Millionenvermögens und Angehöriger exklusiver Country Clubs, was zu Heucheleivorwürfen im Wahlkampf führte. Jedoch verfehlte er den Einzug in den Senat. Er unterlag Lieberman, der als unabhängiger Kandidat 50 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen errang und damit den Wiedereinzug in den Senat schaffte. Lamont kam nur auf 40 Prozent der Stimmen. Viele Anhänger der Republikanischen Partei gaben Lieberman ihre Stimme und versagten dem republikanischen Kandidaten Alan Schlesinger die Gefolgschaft. Lieberman wurden allgemein größere Chancen als Schlesinger eingeräumt, Lamont zu schlagen. Außerdem gilt Lieberman als wertkonservativ und war so für viele Anhänger der Republikaner wählbar. Im November 2009 kündigte Lamont an, dass er eventuell für die Gouverneurswahlen 2010 in Connecticut kandidieren wolle; im Februar 2010 reichte er seine Kandidatur offiziell bei der Demokratischen Partei ein. Auf einem Parteitag im Mai 2010 unterlag er seinem internen Herausforderer Dan Malloy deutlich. Da Lamont aber die interne Hürde von 15 Prozent der Parteitagsstimmen klar schaffte, konnte er an den Vorwahlen der Demokraten vom 10. August 2010 dennoch teilnehmen, wo er aber ebenfalls klar gegen seinen Konkurrenten Malloy verlor.",

  "text" : "John Hutchyns Tyndall' (14 July 1934 – 19 July 2005) was a British National Socialist. As a prominent figure in British nationalism during the second half of the twentieth century, Tyndall was involved during the 1960s with neo-Nazi movements, most notably being the deputy leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement under Colin Jordan. However, he is best known for leading the National Front (NF) in the late 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Born in Devon, Tyndall undertook national service prior to reading the work of Adolf Hitler and involving himself in extreme-right politics. In the mid-1950s he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Growing frustrated with the LEL's approach, in 1957 he co-founded the National Labour Party (NLP) with John Bean. In 1960 the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Tyndall grew close to Jordan and together they embraced an overt Neo-Nazi approach to racial nationalism, establishing a paramilitary group called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement. In 1962 he was convicted and imprisoned for establishing a paramilitary organisation. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall then formed his Greater Britain Movement, another explicitly Neo-Nazi group, in 1964. In 1967 Tyndall joined the newly established National Front, which was then led by Chesterton. He took on the role of Vice Chairman and eventually assumed the position of Chairman in 1972. His leadership was however threatened by both a 'populist moderate' faction and a Strasserite faction. In 1974 he was deposed as Chairman and briefly expelled from the party the following year. On his return he resumed his position as Chairman, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980, forming his short-lived New National Front. In 1982 he established the new British National Party, which grew into the most prominent extreme-right group in the UK by the late 1980s. Electoral success however largely eluded the party. Tyndall's refusal to moderate any of the party's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of 'modernisers', who succeeded in ousting him in 1999, when he was replaced by Nick Griffin. Tyndall retained his affiliation with the BNP for the following few years prior to his death.",

  "text" : "Erich Honecker (German: [ˈeːʁɪç ˈhɔnɛkɐ]; 25 August 1912 – 29 May 1994) was a German politician who, as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, led the German Democratic Republic from 1971 until the weeks preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. From 1976 onward he was also the country's official head of state as chairman of the State Council following Willi Stoph's relinquishment of the post. Honecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned during the Nazi era. Following World War II, he was freed and soon relaunched his political activities, founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955. As the Security Secretary of the Party’s Central Committee in the new East German state, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore responsibility for the \"order to fire\" along the Inner German border. In 1971, he initiated a political power struggle that led, with Soviet support, to his replacing Walter Ulbricht as First Secretary of the Central Committee and as chairman of the state's National Defense Council. Under his command, the country adopted a programme of \"consumer socialism\" and moved toward the international community by normalising relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN, in what is considered one of his greatest political successes. As Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s under the liberalising reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system and was consequently forced to resign by his party in October 1989 as the Communist regime sought to retain its power. Honecker's eighteen years at the helm of the soon-to-collapse German Democratic Republic came to an end. Following German reunification, he escaped to the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991 but was extradited back to Germany a year later to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuses committed by the East German regime. However, the proceedings were abandoned due to illness and he was freed from custody to travel to join his family in exile in Chile, where he died in May 1994 from liver cancer.",

  "text" : "Bernie Hansen (born November 26, 1944) is a former longtime Chicago alderman, serving on the Chicago City Council from 1983 to 2002, when he retired as alderman of the 44th Ward citing health reasons. He is a Democrat. Hansen was appointed to the Council when the incumbent alderman, John Merlo, unexpectedly resigned. In 1987 he defeated Dr. Ron Sable, a liberal gay activist, by a 52% to 47% margin in the race for 44th Ward alderman. It was a hard-fought campaign in the city's 44th Ward, which at the time was the heart of the city's gay community. Sable ran against Hansen again in 1991, but Hansen prevailed again, 65% to 35%. From 1994 to 2000, he served as one of four U.S. commissioners to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a presidential appointment to a bilateral treaty organization with Canada responsible for fisheries management research and recommendations and for sea lamprey control for the Great Lakes fisheries. For part of that time, he chaired the commission. He sponsored or co-sponsored several human rights ordinances, including the Human Rights Ordinance expanding protection against discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodations, and credit to gay males, lesbians, and persons with disabilities, an ordinance to assist victims of hate crimes, and a 1997 ordinance Hansen introduced to extend health-care benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian city employees. Thomas M. Tunney, his successor as 44th Ward alderman whom Hansen had \"hand-picked\", became Chicago's first openly gay alderman. Hansen was also an active proponent of environmentalist measures, including recycling programs and the extension of Chicago's moratorium against the creation of new landfills. Some residents of the Lakeview community voiced concern that Hansen was more concerned with building expensive condos and co-ops, then re-building the neighborhood with affordable housing during his tenure. He serves on the board of many community councils as well as fund raising organizations, including the John Merlo Sports Program. John Merlo was the son of Mike Merlo leader of the Unione Siciliana during the 1920s. Mike Merlo had such complete control of the Organized Crime activities in Chicago, that upon his death in 1924, a war between north side gangs against Johnny Torrio (with underling) Al Capone at his side, instantly erupted. The war lasted 4 bloody years and included the St. Valentines Day Massacre. After his retirement from the city council, he continued to serve as Democratic committeeman from the 44th Ward, ultimately handing over the title to Alderman Tom Tunney. John Merlo held the position from 1969-92. Hansen made an attempt to be a Democratic Congressional Candidate for Illinois' 5th District in 2002, but when the Democratic National Committee backed Clinton Administration phenom Rahm Emanuel in the race, Hansen withdrew and soon after resigned from the 44th Ward Aldermanic seat. He is married to Annette and has two sons, Paul and David. He has two grandchildren. He attended the University of Chicago and has residences in both Chicago and Arizona. He is a longtime Cubs fan and avid golfer.",

Coleridge was the eldest son of John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge, Lord Chief Justice of England, and Jane Fortescue Seymour. His grandfather, John Taylor Coleridge, was the nephew of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford. He was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1877. Coleridge was elected Member of Parliament for Sheffield Attercliffe in the 1885 general election and held the seat until 1894 when he succeeded his father as second Baron Coleridge. Coleridge became a QC in 1892 and served as a Judge of the High Court of Justice from 1907 to 1923.

He previously ran for mayor in 2001 and in a special election in 2003. Bunten is a member of the Republican Party. Bunten was the first mayor to be elected in Topeka under the new council-manager government, which stripped most of the powers of the office of mayor. Instead, the city council and appointed city manager holds most of the power. As such, Bunten's role is limited to leading city council meetings, promoting economic development, and being the \"ceremonial head\" of the city. He replaced James McClinton as mayor, who did not seek a second term after the powers of the office were reduced. A native Topekan, Bunten was a basketball player while attending Topeka High School. He was a teammate and good friend of Dean Smith, who later went on to fame as a basketball coach at North Carolina. Bunten and Smith both attended the University of Kansas and were members of Phi Gamma Delta social fraternity. After college Bunten entered the US Marine Corps and served in Korea, rising to the rank of Captain. In 2010, Bunten decided to change the name of Topeka to Google in honor of the company Google, Inc. for one day. This was considered a ploy to attract Google to Topeka as a site for a high speed Internet installation. The site eventually was located in Kansas City, Kansas. Bunten has led an effort to improve the downtown area and promoted a plan to raise funds for the development of the area. In 2012, Bill Bunten announced that he would not seek re-election in April 2013 at a City Council meeting.",

  "text" : "王䓪鳴女爵士，DBE，JP（Dr Dame Rosanna Wong Yick-ming，1952年8月15日－），1979年至1992年期間曾冠夫姓為譚王䓪鳴（Mrs Rosanna Tam Wong Yick-ming），是香港社會工作者及政治家，自1980年起出任香港青年協會總幹事至今。在香港主權移交以前，王䓪鳴曾在1985年至1991年出任立法局非官守委任議員，1988年至1991年任行政局非官守議員，此後曾一度退出政壇，但旋於1992年重返行政局，並於1993年起兼任房屋委員會主席。王䓪鳴在行政局任內深得港督彭定康信用，1995年更接替鄧蓮如女男爵成為行政局召集人（即首席非官守議員），隨後在1997年獲英廷獎授DBE勳銜，成為繼鄧蓮如女男爵後，歷來第二位華人女爵士，在主權移交前夕的殖民地政府具舉足輕重的影響力。 1997年在主權移交後，王䓪鳴過渡到特區政府行政長官董建華的行政會議，留任非官守成員。惟房委會後來在1999年爆出一連串居屋短樁醜聞，身兼房委會主席的王䓪鳴被輿論質疑要為事件負責，最終在2000年6月立法會表決通過對她和房屋署署長苗學禮的不信任動議前，辭去房委會主席一職。立法會後在2003年1月發表短樁醜聞調查報告，當中再對王䓪鳴等人作出譴責。自從發生短樁醜聞後，王䓪鳴在2002年未獲行政會議續任而卸任，但在2001年至2007年獲港府聘任為教育統籌委員會主席，2003年起更獲中華人民共和國政府委為全國港區政協委員。 另一方面，王䓪鳴在商界也有一定發展，她除自1996年起成為香港上海滙豐銀行非執行董事外，自2001年起也在李嘉誠爵士擁有的長江實業（改組後成為長江實業地產有限公司（經營房地產））出任獨立非執行董事。",

  "text" : "Desley Carleton Scott (born 27 June 1943 in Toowoomba) is an Australian retired Labor Party politician who was the member for Woodridge in the Parliament of Queensland from 2001 to 2015. Scott was elected to parliament at the 2001 state election, after working as an electoral officer for 16 years. She holds a dental nurse certificate. Due to the tiny size of the ALP caucus since the party's defeat at the 2012 election, she was a member of the shadow cabinet but did not become a minister as she retired at the 2015 election. At the 2012 election, Desley Scott retained her seat with a significant margin for a Labor MP of 5.8%, after a 19.57% swing against her party. According to Independent MP Alex Douglas, \"She was completely focussed on the needs of Woodridge residents, which in turn earned her the respect of her constituents.\", which led to her being one of only seven Queensland ALP MPs being elected at the 2012 election.",

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014.",

  "text" : "Francisco Labastida Ochoa (Spanish pronunciation: [fɾanˈsisko laβasˈtiða]; born August 14, 1942) is a Mexican economist and politician affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who became the first presidential candidate of his party to lose a presidential election, which he did in the 2000 presidential election to Vicente Fox. Labastida was born to Gloria Ochoa de Labastida and Dr. Eduardo Labastida Kofahl. His wife, Dr. Teresa Uriarte, was director of UNAM's Institute of Aesthetics Research. His great-grandfather fought on the side of Former Mexican President Benito Juárez in the War of Reform, and his grandfather was Governor of Sinaloa as well as federal deputy. Just like his grandfather, Labastida served as governor of Sinaloa (1987–1992), defeating Manuel Clouthier of the National Action Party. During and after his tenure as governor, Labastida was accused of protecting Sinaloan drug traffickers and overlooking their criminal activities. Labastida was Secretary of Energy during the administration of Miguel de la Madrid. He was also Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of the Interior during the administration of Ernesto Zedillo. After losing the 2000 presidential election, he served as president of the Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo de México. In the 2006 general election, he was elected to the Senate for the PRI, representing Sinaloa.",

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, working on issues of international economic development, Africa and public-private partnerships, and chairman of the US-Taiwan Business Council. He is considered to be a leading neoconservative. However, Wolfowitz rejects the term and prefers to call himself a \"Scoop Jackson Republican,\" after Democratic U.S. senator Henry M. Jackson who was known for his hawkish views on foreign policy. After serving two years, he resigned as president of the World Bank Group due to scandals described by a Reuters report as \"a protracted battle over his stewardship, prompted by his involvement in a high-paying promotion for his companion\". He was reportedly the model for a minor character named Philip Gorman in Saul Bellow's 2001 book Ravelstein.",
