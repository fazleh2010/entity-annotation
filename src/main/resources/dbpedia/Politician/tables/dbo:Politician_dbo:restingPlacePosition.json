After moving to Canada, and later British Columbia, he was president of the British Columbia Building Association and operated a dry goods, millinery, tailoring and grocery business. Cope defeated John Thomas Carroll in the 1892 mayoral election, one of the most hotly contested and closest in the city's history, winning with an 11 vote majority. He is the youngest elected mayor in the history of Vancouver, having been aged 32 at the time of his election. During the election, he garnered support of the city's business class, and the Vancouver World newspaper. His council however would consist of \"reformers\" of the working class, in opposition to Cope's representation of the business class. During his mayoralty, the city experienced an economic downturn; Cope responded by attempting to limit civic expenses, including the laying off of city employees, and initiating cutbacks. He also advocated for the Canada-Australia Steam Line, with the inaugural ship arriving in June 1893. Cope was a Freemason. He drowned during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897 at Summit Lake, Yukon, when his horse fell while crossing the body of water. He tried unsuccessfully to rescue the horse and was pulled away by the undercurrents. His body was later transported back to Vancouver in the same vessel along with notorious American con artist Soapy Smith which resulted in a mixup of the bodies at their respective funerals. They were later switched upon the realization of the error. He was later buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.",
