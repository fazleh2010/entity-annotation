Elected in November 1970, she first took office in January 1971, holding one of five seats (Position 1) in House District 13 (mostly in Lane County). With the implementation in 1972 of a reapportionment plan that replaced all existing Oregon House districts with new single-member districts, Fadeley represented new District 42 starting with the 1973 legislative session. In 1971 and 1973, she chaired the House Environment and Land Use Committee. During her tenure as the chair, the committee oversaw the passage of Senate Bill 100, Oregon’s pioneering, statewide land-use planning legislation, as well as the Oregon Bottle Bill. The passage of SB 100 prompted the formation of 1000 Friends of Oregon, a watchdog organization committed to the defense of, and advocacy for, the state's land-use program. Later she became a charter member and a national board member of the Older Women's League (OWL), a grassroots organization that advocates for women as they age. After her service in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Fadeley began a career at the University of Oregon, where she was assistant vice provost. Fadeley was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was married to Edward Fadeley for about 30 years, ending in 1984. During the 1970s, the couple both served in theOregon Legislature — Nancie in the House and Ed in the Senate. The mother of two children, Fadeley is now a freelance journalist who writes about Oregon history, environmental issues, and concerns of older women.",

Professionally, Carrington rose to become CEO of the Sirchie Group, a company specializing in evidence-collection gear for police and top-dollar security products for businesses. He was first elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1995. In 2005, Carrington was charged with illegally exporting evidence-collection gear to China and took a plea bargain in December 2005 to felony charges in which he has been fined $850,000. One of his companies also took a plea agreement in the matter. The law was altered to allow such exports a few years later. Many large companies have had to make files to track their resold goods to avoid penalty. The charge was for rape kits, finger print imaging kits, finger printing powder kits, and other evidence collecting products, etc. The effects were not sold directly to China, but were resold without the explicit knowledge of Carrington. Paper handling and documentation were handled badly by Carrington. However, under the law this circumstance was not an exception and a guilty plea was submitted.",

Although \"Quaker Meadows\" Joe is usually hailed as the Major McDowell who was the hero of the battle, some descendants of \"Pleasant Gardens Joe\" maintain that it was their ancestor who led the Burke County militia, a claim which, according to the Dictionary of American Biography, is contradicted by contemporary evidence. According to the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, \"Pleasant Gardens\" McDowell was later appointed a North Carolina militia general, and served in the 3rd United States Congress from 1793 to 1795. However, these accomplishments are sometimes credited to Joseph \"Quaker Meadows\" McDowell, although the Dictionary of American Biography notes that the Congressional directory may be correct.

  "text" : "Jonathan Jennings (March 27, 1784 – July 26, 1834) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine-term congressman from Indiana. Born in either Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806. Jennings initially intended to practice law, but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself, and pursued interests in land speculation and politics. Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career. In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown, in Clark County. He was elected as the Indiana Territory's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate. By 1812 he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government. Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812. As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816, which authorized the organization of Indiana's state government and state constitution. He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention, held in Corydon in June 1816, where he helped draft the state's first constitution. Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government. In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements. Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life. His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years. Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings's life and impact on the development of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings's importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen's assessment that the state \"owes him more than she can compute.\"",

Currently a government affairs counselor for K & L Gates in Washington, DC, Walsh retired from the United States House of Representatives in 2009 after serving for twenty years. Walsh represented a portion of Central New York, that is now known as the state's 24th Congressional District. While in Congress, Walsh was a member of the United States House Committee on Appropriations for 16 years, also chairing several of its subcommittees. As chair of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, alone, Walsh had spending oversight of more than $100 billion during the 109th Congress. In his capacities as chair and member of committees, subcommittees, and caucuses in Congress, Walsh secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds for veterans affairs, healthcare, technology, the environment, higher educational institutions, and many other areas. Walsh was further active in the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which the Walsh Visa was created and named in his honor. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus, Walsh secured passage of laws aimed at guaranteeing universal hearing screenings for newborns and infants in the United States. In 2009, an act that he proposed and which was enacted that achieved this effort was renamed for him in his honor, becoming known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Walsh's change of perspective regarding both of then-President George W. Bush's troop surge of 2007 and ideology regarding the Iraq War, caused Walsh's views to gain headlines in the news media, as well as for additionally desiring a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. For one decade during the 1970s and 1980s, Walsh was active on the Syracuse City Council, serving as its leader for five years. In 1999, he issued a challenge with several goals that is known as The Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative (SNI) for revitalization of the city. The many phases of SNI have been successful in improving neighborhoods and housing in numerous areas of the city. Generally known as a moderate, pro-labor Republican, Walsh currently lives in Washington, DC with his wife, Dede. Walsh's father, William F. Walsh, served as Mayor of Syracuse during the 1960s, as well as a Republican Congress Member of the House of Representatives in the 1970s.",

His positions created a rift between him and the Indiana General Assembly who overrode all of his anti-banking vetoes. He responded by launching legal challenges to the acts, but was ruled against by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia.",

John Adams Gilmer besuchte die öffentlichen Schulen und eine Privatschule in seinem Heimatort Greensboro. Danach arbeitete er zunächst als Lehrer, bevor er die Rechtswissenschaften studierte, 1832 in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen wurde und als Jurist in Greensboro zu praktizieren begann. Später wurde er Staatsanwalt im Guilford County. Politisch betätigte sich Gilmer ab 1846 als Mitglied des Senats von North Carolina, dem er bis 1856 angehörte. In diesem Jahr war er der Kandidat der in Auflösung befindlichen Whigs für das Amt des Gouverneurs von North Carolina; er unterlag aber dem demokratischen Amtsinhaber Thomas Bragg. Danach trat er zur American Party über, für die er ins Repräsentantenhaus in Washington gewählt wurde; bei der erfolgreichen Wiederwahl zwei Jahre später kandidierte er für die Opposition Party. Während seiner vierjährigen Amtszeit war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Wahlausschusses (Committee on Elections). Nach Ausbruch des Bürgerkrieges, in dem Gilmers Bruder Jeremy als Generalmajor der Konföderiertenarmee diente, blieb er politisch tätig und gehörte von 1864 bis 1865 dem Repräsentantenhaus des zweiten Konföderiertenkongresses an. 1866 war er Delegierter zur National Union Convention in Philadelphia; dort schlug der Versuch fehl, eine neue Partei zur Unterstützung der Politik von Präsident Andrew Johnson zu gründen. Zwei Jahre später starb John Adams Gilmer in Greensboro.",

Im Jahr 1826 zog Joseph McDonald mit seiner Mutter aus Ohio ins Montgomery County in Indiana. Mit zwölf Jahren ging er dann bei einem Sattler in Lafayette in die Lehre. Später besuchte er das Wabash College in Crawfordsville, ehe er 1840 seinen Abschluss an der Asbury University in Greencastle machte. Er studierte danach die Rechtswissenschaften, wurde 1843 in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen und arbeitete von 1843 bis 1847 als Staatsanwalt, ehe er sich als selbständiger Jurist in Crawfordsville niederließ. Seine politische Laufbahn begann mit der Wahl ins Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten, dem er ab dem 4. März 1849 als Vertreter des achten Kongresswahlbezirks von Indiana angehörte. Nach zwei Jahren schied er zunächst wieder aus dem Kongress aus. 1856 wurde er zum Attorney General von Indiana gewählt, was er nach einer Bestätigung im Amt bis 1860 blieb. Nachdem er 1859 nach Indianapolis gezogen war, bewarb McDonald sich im Jahr 1864 vergeblich um das Amt des Gouverneurs von Indiana; er unterlag dem republikanischen Amtsinhaber Oliver Hazard Perry Morton, mit dem er seit langem befreundet war, deutlich. 1874 kandidierte Joseph McDonald dann erfolgreich für einen Sitz im Senat der Vereinigten Staaten, den er vom 4. März 1875 bis zum 3. März 1881 innehatte. Beim Versuch der Wiederwahl scheiterte er am späteren US-Präsidenten Benjamin Harrison.

As mayor, Whitaker was known for supporting spending on quality of life services such as parks and recreation, as well as spearheading a campaign to prevent a drastic reduction in the operations of Eielson Air Force Base due to federal budget cuts. Whitaker endorsed Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election and spoke during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Many member of the state GOP expressed ill feelings about the decision, with one former state senator accusing him of being a Republican In Name Only. Whitaker's endorsement of Obama was notable as the mayor of the second-largest metropolitan area in Alaska, the home state of 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who was nominated by John McCain after the Democratic convention. In 2009, Whitaker endorsed Democrat Luke Hopkins to be his successor as mayor. Hopkins won the election in a runoff on November 3 and succeeded Whitaker on November 16, 2009.

He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate. Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated, 57.3 to 38.9. Though considered as a frontrunner, in April 2015, he declined to run for the US Senate seat Marco Rubio is expected to vacate before the Senate elections, 2016 to run for the US Presidency. Atwater has since changed his mind, stating that he may run in the upcoming 2016 Senate election.",

He started a monthly recreation program for patients at Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home and served as Chairman of the Center's Advisory Board. He has also helped substance abusers get their lives back on track by serving as vice chair of the Camelot Counseling Center's Board of Directors. Lavelle suffered a stroke on January 19, 2007 and died in a coma on January 24, just two days short of his 58th birthday. Lavelle is survived by his three sons and four grandchildren. To honor his death and to allow members of the New York State Assembly to attend his funeral, Speaker of the New York State Assembly Sheldon Silver canceled the session of the Assembly for January 28, 2007. The funeral service was attended by over 1,000 people and included the Governor of the State of New York Eliot Spitzer, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, candidates for New York State Comptroller, over 50 Assemblymembers, and all of the elected officials from Staten Island from both political parties. His seat was filled by special election, with fellow Democrat Matthew Titone elected to succeed him in the Assembly.",

He writes: \"Over the last 9 years, I have always voted my conscience placing my constituents’ best interests above anything else. As I promised 9 years ago, my votes have reflected fiscal conservatism combined with a great concern for protecting open space and saving the Chesapeake Bay. I continue to remain an independent thinker, placing policy before party.\"",

First elected in 1990, he was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002. A Democrat, he represented the old District 24 prior to the 2002 redistricting, and the current District 23 thereafter. The district included portions of Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Sibley and Waseca counties in the south central part of the state. Hottinger served as a majority whip from 1993 to 2000, and as an assistant majority leader during the 2001–02 biennium. He was chosen majority leader in 2003 after Senator Roger Moe retired to run for governor. After a difficult year, in which the DFL Party majority was seen to have been outmaneuvered by Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty, Hottinger stepped down, turning power over to Senator Dean Johnson. In January 2004, he was selected the national legislator of the month by the Center for Policy Alternatives one month after Illinois legislator Barack Obama won the honor Hottinger has been quoted as saying the two of them have since taken “divergent” paths. The CPA praised Hottinger “…for disowning budget cuts and yet giving the GOP enough votes on the budget bills so that government would not be shut down, which would have imposed further pain on vulnerable Minnesotans and state employees.” The CPA added that he had \"strengthened the progressive community for battles in 2004 and beyond.\" During his time in the Senate, Hottinger chaired the following committees: Health and Family Security, Rules, and Early Childhood Policy and Finance division of the Finance Committee. He also chaired the Legislative Committee to Review Administrative Rules and Senate Subcommittees on Insurance, Consumer Protection, Rulemaking, and Higher Education, Senate Budget, Personnel, Ethical Conduct, Permanent and Joint Rules, Intergovernmental Relations and Property Taxes. Hottinger was active in the [Council of State Governments] (CSG) and chaired the [Midwestern Legislative Conference] in 2001. He became the national chair of CSG in 2004 in leadership partnership with Governor [Frank Murkowski] of Alaska who served as CSG President. He was the first Minnesota legislator or Governor to serve as the national leader of the organization other than Governor Harold Stassen who was National President in 1941-42. Hottinger chose not to run for re-election in 2006. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney.[3] He was suspended for a minimum of 18 months, petitioned to lift the suspension on June 17, 2010 and the Minnesota Supreme Court returned him to practice on January 12, 2011 finding him “prepared and morally qualified” to practice law. The Supreme Court decision  followed a hearing before the Minnesota Board of Lawyer's Professional Responsibility Board on November 18. 2010 and its unanimous decision to recommend reinstatement. There were no witnesses in opposition to the reinstatement and Hottinger’s eleven character witness included local attorneys and colleagues from the political world including DFL Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, former DFL Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, former Republican U.S. Senator David Durenberger and former Republican Party Chair Charles “Chuck” Slocum. After leaving the Senate, Hottinger worked for about four years as the chief consultant for some non-profit organizations funded by Minnesota-Washington philanthropist Ned Crosby: the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Process and Promoting Health Democracy in Minnesota and, on a limited basis, Health Democracy Oregon in Portland, Oregon. That work focused on Crosby’s Citizen Jury process for promoting citizen engagement through deliberative democracy. Hottinger was the Project Director for the Citizen Jury on Election Recounts concentrating on the process used in Minnesota in the recount of the U.S. Senate race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman in 2009. Hottinger was also a leader as the initial Vice President for Legal and Government Affairs for “The Minnesota World’s Fair”, the organization which launched the effort to bring the World’s Fair to Minnesota in 2022 or 2023. Hottinger has been active in non-profits including serving on the Executive Committee and as Chair of the Northstar (Minnesota) Chapter of the Sierra Club, a member of the Board and Executive Committee of the Northeast Midwest Institute in Washington, D.C. and as a member of the Board of the Somali Justice Center in Minneapolis.

Februar 1859 in St. Louis, Missouri) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker der Demokratischen Partei, der den Bundesstaat Indiana in beiden Kammern des Kongresses vertrat. Noch im Jahr von Edward Hannegans Geburt zogen seine Eltern mit ihm ins Bourbon County im Staat Kentucky. Dort besuchte er die öffentlichen Schulen, studierte die Rechtswissenschaften und arbeitete als Lehrer sowie als landwirtschaftliche Hilfskraft. 1827 wurde er dann in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen, woraufhin er nach Indiana umzog. Er lebte dort zunächst in Vincennes und Terre Haute, ehe er sich dauerhaft in Covington niederließ und dort als Jurist zu praktizieren begann. Politisch betätigte er sich in seiner neuen Heimat ebenfalls. Von 1832 bis 1833 saß er im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana, in das er später von 1841 bis 1842 noch einmal zurückkehrte. Zwischen dem 4. März 1833 und dem 3. März 1837 gehörte Hannegan dem Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten in Washington, D.C. an. Nachdem er in der Folge zunächst wieder als Jurist in Indiana gearbeitet hatte, zog er schließlich am 4. März 1843 in den US-Senat ein, wo er bis zum 3. März 1849 verblieb. Da ihn seine Partei nicht erneut nominierte, musste er nach einer Amtsperiode wieder aus dem Kongress ausscheiden. Während seiner Zeit im Senat war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Private Land Claims. Vom 30. Juni 1849 bis zum 13. Januar 1850 fungierte Edward Hannegan als Gesandter der Vereinigten Staaten in Preußen. Nach seiner Rückkehr war er wieder als Jurist in Covington tätig, bis er 1857 nach St. Louis umzog.

Capps lost an election to Andrea Seastrand for the 22nd district in California in 1994, which was a landslide year for the Republicans. While driving home from a campaign event during the summer of 1996, Capps' vehicle was struck by a drunk driver. Capps was seriously injured and was unable to actively campaign until the final few weeks of the race. During his absence from the campaign, his opponent, graciously, didn't make his failing health an issue. Ultimately, despite his absence from the campaign trail, Capps won, even as Bob Dole edged Bill Clinton in the district. Capps died of a heart attack at Dulles Airport only nine months into his term. The Reverend Jesse Jackson attended his funeral. Capps was succeeded by his widow, Lois Capps, who won in a special election in the spring of 1998. Subsequent legislation by Congresswoman Capps has mandated the presence of AEDs in public places. Before entering politics, Capps taught for more than thirty years at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a Professor in the Religious Studies department he helped define the field, and cataloged the growth and changes in his 1995 book Religious Studies: The Making of a Discipline. An anti-war activist during the 1960s, he later initiated a nationally renowned course titled \"Religion and the Impact of Vietnam\" in 1979. His name lives on in the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",

  "text" : "Wyon Dale \"W. D.\" Childers (born November 25, 1933) is a former West Florida politician who served 30 years in the State Senate, from 1970 to 2000, including a stint as Senate President from 1980 to 1982 and as dean from 1988 to 2000. He holds the title of Florida's longest-serving state legislator. He earned the nickname \"Banty Rooster\" – after the diminutive, swaggering barnyard fowl – and became known for his eccentric mannerisms and colorful, folksy expressions. Childers was popular in his district for the ample state funding and \"turkey\" projects he sent home, including $12.5 million for the Pensacola Civic Center and the I-110 extension to Gregory Street. Initially a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in 1995. After term limits forced him from the Florida Senate in 2000, Childers ran for the District 1 seat of the Escambia County Commission. He became embroiled in the soccer complex corruption scandal and was found guilty of violating the Florida Sunshine Law and of bribing Commissioner Willie Junior to help push the purchases of two properties, totaling $6.2 million, from Childers' associates Joe and Georgann Elliott. Childers served nearly three years of a 42-month prison sentence in West Palm Beach and was released on 17 June 2009, after which he relocated away from Pensacola. On 8 June 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the bribery conviction, ruling that Childers' constitutional right to confront his accuser had been violated, as the defense team was not allowed to question Junior on his change of testimony.",

  "text" : "Craig Anthony Washington (born October 12, 1941) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Texas who served in the Texas State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. The son of Roy and Azalia Washington, Washington graduated from Prairie View A&M University in 1966 and was originally interested in becoming a doctor, but as admissions to medical school had already ceased, Washington decided to instead apply at Texas Southern University's law school. In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. \"Mickey\" Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the \"People's Five\"), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989. Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district. In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and still holds the seat today. Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas. On New Year's Day 2008, Washington shot at a car containing two teenagers. After being indicted by a grand jury in 2009, he agreed to two years of probation. However, Washington's attorney subsequently claimed that Washington fired because his life was in danger. Washington has since countersued the teenagers, alleging assault and property damage. The Internal Revenue Service has also sued Washington, alleging that he owes $610,000 in unpaid taxes. On January 8, 2015, Washington received a suspension of his Texas attorney's license. The 335th District Court of Bastrop County, Texas found that Washington had violated various rules, including the rules prohibiting neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him and failing to keep a client reasonably informed. On March 12, 2015, a \"modified judgment was entered imposing a four-year partially probated suspension with 12 months active.\" He was also ordered to pay over $24,600 in legal fees and expenses. Washington filed an appeal.",

Max Gardner in the 1920 Democratic primary for Governor. He was later called \"the Good Roads governor\" for his support of a modern highway system. Morrison also pushed for increased funds for public education, while also battling the teaching of the theory of evolution. He was later appointed to serve as a United States Senator for the state of North Carolina (after the death of Lee S. Overman) between 1930 and 1932, but lost his seat in the Democratic primary runoff to Robert R. Reynolds. Morrison was later elected to one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He again lost a Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 1944, to Clyde R. Hoey. He died in Quebec City in 1953. A ten-story residence hall on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill is named in his honor.

From 1915 to 1919 he was House majority leader; from this position he opposed the Wilson administration's \"Preparedness\" crusade, seeking unsuccessfully to hold down the growth in size of the army and navy. He was one of the representatives who voted against declaring war on Germany in April 1917; indeed, his example and speech against American entry probably swelled the number of dissenters to 50. He threw himself into the war effort thereafter but remained a critic of some of the administration's war policies, especially regarding taxation policies. He championed an \"excess profits\" tax that was steeply progressive over a policy of selling Liberty Bonds that shifted the financial burden of the war onto future generations. After giving an impassioned speech in 1920 he suffered a severe stroke, from which he never recovered.",

(A 1996 law requires a 3/5 supermajority in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly for such measures.) Telfer has lived in Bend since 1977. She has two daughters. She earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Denver, and did post-graduate work at Franklin University and the University of Oregon. She has taught at Central Oregon Community College and served as vice-chair on the Bend Development Board. In 2010, Telfer filed for the special election for Oregon State Treasurer, to complete the term of Ben Westlund, who died in office, but lost to Democratic incumbent Ted Wheeler in the November general election. In the Republican primary of the 2012 legislative elections, Telfer was defeated by Tim Knopp, a former state Representative and vice president of the Central Oregon Builders Association. She became the Oregon Lottery Commissioner. In 2016, she is running for the nomination of the Independent Party of Oregon's nomination for Treasurer of Oregon. She is expected to be that party's first nominee for a statewide office.",

Klein was reelected in November 1978 to a second two-year term. In January 1979, he was elected House majority whip by his fellow legislators.

He attended Springfield College (B.A., 1993), the Université Laval in Quebec, the University of Massachusetts Amherst (M.A., 2001) and the University of Provence in France. An employee of Bennington College's office of external relations, Campion is also a trustee for the Bennington Museum, a commissioner of the Bennington Housing Authority, vice-chair of the Bennington County Democrats, and a director of the Bennington Chamber of Commerce. He ran for state representative in 2010, one of three candidates seeking two seats in the Bennington-2-1 district. Both incumbent state representatives, Democrat Tim Corcoran II and Republican Joseph L. Krawczyk, Jr. were seeking re-election and had endorsed each other. In the general election held on November 2, 2010, Campion won 1,461 votes, finishing behind Corcoran's 1,965 but ahead of Krawczyk's 1,120. He was therefore elected and took office on January 5, 2011. He won re-election in 2012. Campion was elected to the Vermont Senate in 2014. Campion is openly gay; he lives in Bennington with his partner Eric Hatch. He is one of six openly gay members of the Vermont Legislature, alongside representatives Bill Lippert (D–Hinesburg), Herb Russell (D–Rutland), Matt Trieber (D–Bellows Falls) and Joanna E.

  "text" : "Thomas Michael \"Tom\" Apodaca is a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state's forty-eighth Senate district, including constituents in Buncombe, Henderson, and Transylvania counties. He was reelected in 2010. Tom Apodaca is a businessman and state legislator. He currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. His wife Lisa is a former public school teacher; they have been married for over 30 years and have two sons. All four Apodacas are graduates of Western Carolina University, where Tom served as a member of the board of trustees. Apodaca was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 2002 during his first campaign for public office; he was re-elected by his Western North Carolina constituents in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. In addition to chairing the Senate Rules Committee, he co-chairs the Committee on Insurance, the Committee on Pensions & Retirement and Aging and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education & Higher Education. In response to public outcry after a coal ash spill into the Dan River in northern North Carolina from a facility owned by Duke Energy Inc., Apodaca said he planned to draft legislation in May 2014 to require Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash ponds, including the one in Buncombe County. He told the Hendersonville Times-News on February 12: \"I don't want a containment plan, I want a plan to get rid of it. ... We need a five- to 10-year plan to get rid of them because we don't need it sitting there next to the river.\" Over the court of his time in politics, Apodaca has accepted over $65,000 from organizations representing Duke Energy and Progress Energy. 61 In the 2013 legislative session, Apodaca introduced and voted for a bill, Senate Bill 10, to reorganize the Environmental Management Commission and the N.C. Utilities Commission and replace the members with new appointees. This Bill included the elimination of dozens of obsolete and rarely convened boards and commissions. Senate Bill 10 was not signed into law in 2013. Sen. Tom Apodaca said his main complaint to the House version was that it strikes language that would fire 12 special superior court judges. 60 In May 2013, after receiving the maximum $8000 contribution from North Carolina Automobile Dealers Association, Apodaca sponsored legislation that would make it illegal for any car maker to bypass dealerships and sell directly to consumers in North Carolina. Apodaca's proposal was widely criticized as anti-competitive and aimed at insulating automobile dealers from Tesla Motors' business model. In March 2016, Apodaca led a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly that passed the controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act commonly known as HB2. After this session of congress, Apodaca called on the city of Charlotte to pay the $42,000 cost of the emergency legislative session which led to the bill's passage. After the controversial bill passed, companies such as PayPal withdrew their plans to expand in North Carolina, resulting in the loss of at least four hundred potential jobs for North Carolinians.",

He practiced medicine and farming in Traphill, North Carolina beginning in 1859. During the American Civil War, York was a surgeon with the Wilkes County Home Guards. In 1865, he was elected to a term in the North Carolina House of Representatives; he served again in 1866 and 1879, in addition to terms in the North Carolina Senate in 1876 and 1881. In the election of 1882, opponents of the 1881 Prohibition referendum formed a unity ticket with the Republican Party, called the \"Liberal Anti-Prohibition\" ticket (LAP). York was elected on the LAP ticket to the 48th United States Congress; he served one term and was considered an \"Independent Democrat.\" York did not run again for the U.S. House in 1884, choosing instead to campaign unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina, running on a fusion ticket of Liberals and Republicans. When the returns were canvassed, 215 votes in Robeson County were recorded for a local citizen named \"Tyler York\" rather than for Tyre York. After the 1884 election, Rep. York retired to his home in Traphill, though he served one term in the North Carolina House in 1887. He died on his farm in 1916 and is buried in the Traphill Cemetery.",

Marsh graduated from the University of Oregon, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in history and English. A Democrat, he was first elected to the Oregon Legislature in 1974. Prior to that, he had been president of the Beaverton Education Association. He also was a teacher of history and government at Sunset High School, north of Beaverton. He continued teaching when the Legislature was not in session. In 1975, Governor Robert W. Straub appointed Marsh to a two-year term on the Governor's Committee on Aging. Tom Marsh was reelected to the House in 1976, but in 1978 decided not to run for a third term. He was succeeded by Nancy Ryles. The House district represented by Marsh was numbered District 5 at the time (and since 1971), and remained so under Ryles, but became District 7 in 1982, as a result of a reapportionment plan passed by the Oregon Legislature in 1981, based on data from the 1980 U.S. Census.

While in office, Brawley was elected the President of the National Republican Legislators Association and was named National Legislator of the Year in 1995. Brawley ran for North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance in 2004, losing to James E. Long. In 2012, Brawley was again elected to the House from the Iredell County-based 95th district. He won the May 8 Republican primary, which was tantamount to election, since no Democrat filed for the seat. Meanwhile, Brawley was also in 2012 named to lead the North Carolina chapter of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. In April 2013, Brawley filed House Bill 640 that would allow lobbyists to give unreported gifts to state lawmakers in North Carolina. In May 2013, Brawley resigned as chairman of the House Finance Committee in a dispute with House Speaker Thom Tillis. Brawley lost his bid for another term in the May 2014 Republican primary, with some of his colleagues in the House campaigning against him. Afterwards, the House Republican Caucus passed a vote of \"no confidence\" in Brawley, effectively barring him from caucus meetings. Brawley suggested that the censure was in retaliation for his criticism of Tillis. On December 9, 2015, Brawley announced his candidacy for the office of Governor of North Carolina, challenging current governor Pat McCrory.",

A resident of Cheektowaga, New York, Gorski is a former County Executive of Erie County, New York, which includes Buffalo, New York and many of its suburbs. He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo.",

Her Republican and Independent opponents took 31% and 16% of the vote respectively. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Ruggiero went to high school in Lincoln, Rhode Island before attending Boston College, graduating magna cum laude with a double major in English and Communications.

His family moved briefly to the state of Montana before returning to Wheeler County in Eastern Oregon, where Jones attended public school in the small town of Spray. Jones' mother died when he was just 5 years old. Following his mother's death, his father moved the family to Crook County, where Jones attended school at Prineville. He completed two years of school at Crook County High School before being pulled out by his father, who had designs on making his diminutive son into a professional racing jockey. Jones spent over a year riding horses throughout British Columbia, Canada and in Tijuana, Mexico before he began to gain too much weight, making a further career in horse racing impossible. Jones returned to rural Malheur County, Oregon where he took a job on a cattle ranch. He would remain a ranch hand and rancher for the rest of his working life. In 1939, Jones went into a business partnership with a cousin who owned two cattle ranches, one near the small Oregon town of Jonesboro and the other in close proximity to Juntura. Jones managed the Jonesburo operation for the next ten years before ultimately buying the operation, on which he ran 400 head of cattle. Jones' ranch would ultimately grow to 550 head of cattle contained on 23,000 acres of high desert rangeland. Jones ran the ranch for the next 30 years, serving twice during this time as president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association (OCA). In this capacity Jones gained his first legislative experience engaging in political lobbying on behalf of the interests of the OCA.",

Although the Hong Kong government prior to as well as after the British handover shunned him for his opposition to their policies, Szeto was admired in Hong Kong politics for his strong principles, for eschewing personal gain, and for his rare political acumen.

Aside from his political career, Szeto was also well known for his Chinese calligraphy skills. He was referred to as \"Uncle Wah\" (華叔) by Hong Kong people.",

While in the State Assembly, he and fellow Republican representative and future governor Scott Walker were involved in the \"Wisconsin witch hunt\" in 2001–02, in which they attempted to terminate the employment of state employee Jamyl Witch because of her beliefs as a Wiccan. Walker claimed that Witch's hiring as a prison chaplain raised \"both personal and political concerns\" because she \"practice[d] a religion that actually offends people of many other faiths\". Huebsch likewise said that \"Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus,\" proposing to delete the state appropriation which funded Witch's position, although in the past he had repeatedly advocated increasing state funding for prison chaplains. Walker and Huebsch were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating Witch's employment. Huebsch resigned from the Assembly after Walker, now Governor-elect, appointed Huebsch as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration on December 30, 2010. In a special election on May 3, 2011, the District 94 Assembly seat he had held for eight terms went to Democrat Steve Doyle. In early 2015 Huebsch was moved to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. His position as Secretary of Administration is now held by Scott Neitzel.

From his Senate seat, he then ran a powerful political machine, using A. D. Watts \"to keep the machine oiled back home,\" in the words of one journalist. Senator Simmons refused to endorse Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928.

He was the founder of Hanly's Flying Squadron, which advocated prohibition nationally and played an important role in raising awareness about the effect of alcohol and arousing public support for prohibition. During his term as governor he successfully advocated the passage of a local-option liquor law, which led the majority of Indiana's counties to ban liquor sales. His other achievements included banning gambling, fighting political corruption, and adjusting state agencies to operate on a non-partisan basis. He left office and the Republican Party and became an active and vocal prohibitionist. He was an unsuccessful Prohibition Party candidate for President of the United States in the 1916 election.",

While in private law practice from 1982 to 1995, Sorenson also served as a member of the Board of Education at Lane Community College in Eugene Oregon. During his tenure at Lane Community College, Sorenson advocated strongly for dislocated workers' retraining programs and for childcare for staff and students. In 1993, Sorenson was appointed to the Oregon State Senate, and was elected to a full Senate term in 1994. He was elected Assistant Minority Leader during the 1995 session. Because Oregon term limits at that time prevented Sorenson from running for reelection as a State Senator, he ran for County Commissioner in 1996 and was elected to his first term. He ran successfully for reelection as a County Commissioner in 2000, 2004 and 2008; in 2008 he ran unopposed. In 2009 he was elected by the four other commissioners as Chair of the Board of Commissioners, a position he has held before. Sorenson has always run on a \"pro-environment, pro-education, pro-senior, pro-regular taxpayer, pro-child, pro-civil rights, pro-civil liberties, and pro-people\" platform. In January 2005, Sorenson announced he would challenge incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski, also a Democrat. Sorenson was defeated in the May 2006 Democratic primary for Governor, receiving 16.27% of the vote. In July 2007 Pete Sorenson and Kim Leval were married. Kim is the Executive Director for the Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticides.

Thompson has been a lifelong Buffalonian and held political and politically related professional positions in Buffalo before his service in elective politics. Thompson was appointed to the city council in 2001 and was twice re-elected. He was discouraged from pursuing his interest in election to the United States House of Representatives in 2005. He was encouraged to pursue a New York Senate Seat, but was not nominated by the Democratic Party when the seat first became available in a special election. However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican.",
