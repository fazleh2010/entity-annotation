An opponent of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's government, but an even stronger opponent of the East German Socialist Unity Party and communism in general, he was one of the founding fathers of post-war German democracy. He was also a noted opponent of the far-right and the far-left, i.e. the Nazi Party and the Communist Party of Germany, during the Weimar Republic, and is famous for his description of the communists as \"red-painted Nazis.\" He spent over ten years in Nazi concentration camps, where he was severely mistreated.",

He topped the school examinations between 1947 and 1954. “My passion to serve the community exceeds my desire to make money in the business world,” he said, adding that he had saved the Selangor MIC building from being auctioned off, and had also refinanced two of his cars to organise a national economic congress in 1980. In the Malaysian parliament, he sits on the Public Accounts Committee. He had also served on the National Unity Committee. Nijhar was dropped as a candidate for the 2008 general elections.

A Democrat, he was first elected in 1962 and reelected in 1966, 1970, 1972, and 1976. He represented the old districts 45, 46, and 65, which changed through the years due to legislative redistricting, and included portions of the city of Saint Paul in Ramsey County. Born in Saint Paul, Coleman served as a Signalman 2nd Class in the United States Navy during World War II. He entered politics as a volunteer for the 1948 congressional campaign of Eugene McCarthy, then a professor at the College of St. Thomas (now the University of St. Thomas), where Coleman was a student. He was later Minnesota chair for the 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon Johnson. While in the Senate, Coleman served as an assistant minority leader from 1967 to 1970, as minority leader during the 1971–1972 biennium, and as the first Democrat in 114 years to become majority leader—a position he held from 1973 until leaving the Senate in 1981. The Democrats have held the majority in that chamber of the Minnesota Legislature until January, 2011. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the DFL Party's endorsement for governor in 1970, and for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Coleman was a founder and partner of the advertising agency Coleman-Goff Advertising, later known as Coleman and Christison. He was the father of Chris Coleman, the current mayor of St. Paul, of Minnesota journalist Nick Coleman, and of the Acquisitions Librarian at the Minnesota Historical Society Library, Patrick K. Coleman. Prior to his career in advertising, he was a high school teacher for two years in the rural town of Tyler, MN. Coleman died of leukemia on March 5, 1981. His body lay in state in the Minnesota State Capitol before burial in Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis.",

Er war der Kandidat für einen Senatssitz von Connecticut bei den Senatswahlen vom 7. November 2006. In den parteiinternen Vorwahlen, die die Kandidatur festlegen, besiegte er den Amtsinhaber Joe Lieberman. Lamont ist Erbe eines Millionenvermögens und Angehöriger exklusiver Country Clubs, was zu Heucheleivorwürfen im Wahlkampf führte. Jedoch verfehlte er den Einzug in den Senat. Er unterlag Lieberman, der als unabhängiger Kandidat 50 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen errang und damit den Wiedereinzug in den Senat schaffte. Lamont kam nur auf 40 Prozent der Stimmen. Viele Anhänger der Republikanischen Partei gaben Lieberman ihre Stimme und versagten dem republikanischen Kandidaten Alan Schlesinger die Gefolgschaft. Lieberman wurden allgemein größere Chancen als Schlesinger eingeräumt, Lamont zu schlagen. Außerdem gilt Lieberman als wertkonservativ und war so für viele Anhänger der Republikaner wählbar. Im November 2009 kündigte Lamont an, dass er eventuell für die Gouverneurswahlen 2010 in Connecticut kandidieren wolle; im Februar 2010 reichte er seine Kandidatur offiziell bei der Demokratischen Partei ein. Auf einem Parteitag im Mai 2010 unterlag er seinem internen Herausforderer Dan Malloy deutlich. Da Lamont aber die interne Hürde von 15 Prozent der Parteitagsstimmen klar schaffte, konnte er an den Vorwahlen der Demokraten vom 10. August 2010 dennoch teilnehmen, wo er aber ebenfalls klar gegen seinen Konkurrenten Malloy verlor.",

Born in Wallonia, Hyeronimus arrived in New South Wales in about 1840. In 1842, he established the Lion of Waterloo, the first inn at Montefiores, near present-day Wellington, in the central west of New South Wales. He later built the first house in Wellington, and established the Carriers Arms, the first inn at the present site of Dubbo, New South Wales. In about 1854, Hyeronimus built the homestead The Meeting of the Waters (now named Glenrock), on land west of the Bell River near Wellington. By 1859, he was the proprietor of Goonoo (now Goonoo Goonoo), a pastoral run of 30,000 acres (120 km2) in Wellington County, and also three other pastoral runs totalling 61,480 acres (248.8 km2) in Bligh County. On 15 June 1859, Hyeronimus was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the inaugural member for the electoral district of Wellington. However, he died in Sydney in 1860, after serving only just over one year in office.",

He was a commando with the Royal Marines for seven years, a cattle-breeder, and remains a solicitor specialising in tax matters. He succeeded Emma Nicholson as MP for the constituency, after her defection in 1995 from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Democrats, and her elevation as a Liberal Democrat peer. Following Burnett's decision to stand down in 2005, there was a swing of 5,000 votes in the 2005 election against Burnett's Liberal Democrat successor as candidate. The constituency was reduced in size in a 2006 Boundary Commission re-alignment, and was retained by the Conservative Party. In April 2006 it was announced that Burnett would be created a life peer to join the Liberal Democrat ranks in the House of Lords, and on 31 May he was created Baron Burnett, of Whitchurch in the County of Devon. Burnett for much of his 8 years in Parliament had been regarded among his fellow Liberal Democrat MPs as \"the cat that walked alone\": he distanced himself over his Party's stance on the war in Iraq, for example. One of the high points of Burnett's parliamentary career was his promotion of the Bill which became the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, allowing solicitors, for example, to remain in the traditional partnership arrangements while having some of the benefits of limited companies.",

Currently a government affairs counselor for K & L Gates in Washington, DC, Walsh retired from the United States House of Representatives in 2009 after serving for twenty years. Walsh represented a portion of Central New York, that is now known as the state's 24th Congressional District. While in Congress, Walsh was a member of the United States House Committee on Appropriations for 16 years, also chairing several of its subcommittees. As chair of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, alone, Walsh had spending oversight of more than $100 billion during the 109th Congress. In his capacities as chair and member of committees, subcommittees, and caucuses in Congress, Walsh secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds for veterans affairs, healthcare, technology, the environment, higher educational institutions, and many other areas. Walsh was further active in the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which the Walsh Visa was created and named in his honor. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus, Walsh secured passage of laws aimed at guaranteeing universal hearing screenings for newborns and infants in the United States. In 2009, an act that he proposed and which was enacted that achieved this effort was renamed for him in his honor, becoming known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Walsh's change of perspective regarding both of then-President George W. Bush's troop surge of 2007 and ideology regarding the Iraq War, caused Walsh's views to gain headlines in the news media, as well as for additionally desiring a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. For one decade during the 1970s and 1980s, Walsh was active on the Syracuse City Council, serving as its leader for five years. In 1999, he issued a challenge with several goals that is known as The Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative (SNI) for revitalization of the city. The many phases of SNI have been successful in improving neighborhoods and housing in numerous areas of the city. Generally known as a moderate, pro-labor Republican, Walsh currently lives in Washington, DC with his wife, Dede. Walsh's father, William F. Walsh, served as Mayor of Syracuse during the 1960s, as well as a Republican Congress Member of the House of Representatives in the 1970s.",

  "text" : "Edmund John Philip Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley, FRS, FREng (born 20 February 1948) is an English businessman. He is best known for his role as the chief executive of the energy company BP between 1995 and 2007. This period has been described as the company's \"golden period of expansion and diversification\" though safety and health violations following an investigation of the fatal explosion at BP's Texas City, Texas, plant on 23 March 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured more than 170 others, resulted in fines and awards being given out.Browne was lauded during this period, as he engineered a merger with rival Amoco, and gained access to Russian oil reserves with the creation of TNK-BP. Nicknamed by employees the \"Sun King\" for his management style, he was also praised for increasing BP's interest in renewable energy sources. He resigned from BP in controversial circumstances after a judge found he had lied in court about the details of a personal relationship (though charges of perjury were never brought). He is a former President of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2006 to July 2011). Since 2001, he has been a crossbench member of the House of Lords. Lord Browne joined Riverstone in 2007 as a Partner. Riverstone is co-owner of Cuadrilla resources.",

  "text" : "James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose KT CB CVO VD (1 May 1878 – 20 January 1954), was a Scottish nobleman, naval officer, politician and engineer. The eldest son of Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose, he was educated at Eton College. In 1906 he married Lady Mary Douglas-Hamilton, the only child of the 12th Duke of Hamilton. They had four children, Lord James Graham (later the 7th Duke), Lady Mary Graham, Lord Ronald Graham and Lady Jean Graham. As a mariner, he served in the Mercantile Marine and ASC in South Africa, during which time he obtained the first film ever taken of a total eclipse of the Sun during a Royal Astronomical Society expedition to India in 1899, and took part in a mission in 1900 for Lloyd's of London to the South African Government to establish wireless telegraphic stations on the coast. Having been instrumental in founding the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in 1903, he served in the Auxiliary Naval Service during World War I and was later Commodore of the RNVR Clyde Division, then the East Coast of Scotland RNVR, and fulfilled the role of Commodore of the entire RNVR from 1921 until he retired in 1927. As a result, from 1946 to 1968, whichever ship was attached to the Tay Division of the Royal Naval Reserve (in Dundee) was always temporarily renamed HMS Montrose after the 6th Duke. In 1992, the seventh Duke-class frigate HMS Montrose was so-named for the same reason. In his political life, he was unpaid Assistant Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1905, and Naval Aide-de-Camp to His Majesty. However, he was unsuccessful as the Scottish Unionist Party (effectively the Conservative Party in Scotland) parliamentary candidate for Stirlingshire in 1906, and as the Conservative Party candidate at the 1906 by-election at Eye, Suffolk, and at the subsequent general election in 1910; although holding the courtesy title of the Marquess of Graham from 1907 (when his father was the 5th Duke), he contested these elections as James Graham. He entered the House of Lords as the 6th Duke when he succeeded to the title in 1925. When the Home Rule movement decided to split from the avowedly anti-Home Rule Scottish Unionist Party in 1932, he became chairman of the new centre-right Scottish Party, and successfully steered it towards a merger with the centre-left National Party of Scotland in April 1934, therefore founding the modern Scottish National Party. He joined the Liberal Party in 1936. As an engineer, he was the inventor of the world's first naval aircraft carrier, when in 1912, as a director of William Beardmore and Company, of Dalmuir, he designed a 14,450 ton merchant vessel intended for delivery to the Lloyd Sabaudo Line of Italy as the SS Conte Rosso. When war broke out in 1914, work on the vessel ceased, but was resumed in 1916 as an aircraft carrier. The conversion work was completed in September 1918 and the vessel was commissioned as HMS Argus - recognised as the first ever \"flat top\". The Duke was also designer and owner of the first seagoing heavy oil motorship. He was President of the British Institution of Marine Engineers in 1911, and President of the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1916 and 1917. Afterwards, he was Vice-President of the Institution of Naval Architects, a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a Trustee for the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, a Member of the Royal Company of Archers, and Commodore of the Sea Cadets in Scotland. In 1935 he became the second President on the National Institute for the Deaf, a post he held until his death.",

  "text" : "John Patrick Ducker AO (29 March 1932 - 25 November 2005), Australian labour leader and politician, played a leading role in the Australian labour movement and the Australian Labor Party for 20 years. Ducker was born in Kingston upon Hull, in northern England, the son of a bus driver, and worked on the docks from the age of 14. He migrated to Australia with his family in 1950, and became an ironworker and active in the Federated Ironworkers Association, at that time controlled by the Communist Party of Australia. Ducker, a convert to Catholicism, was a strong anti-Communist and became a supporter of B.A. Santamaria's Industrial Groups, which campaigned successfully to overturn the Communist control of the union. From 1952 Ducker was an official of the union under the new anti-Communist leader, Laurie Short (a non-Catholic). When the Labor Party split in 1955 over the related issues of Communism and the role of Santamaria's \"Movement\" within the party, Ducker did not follow many other Catholic anti-Communists into the Democratic Labor Party, but remained in the Labor Party, becoming a leading figure in the party's right wing. His characteristic North English accent led to him becoming known as \"Broovver Dooker\" throughout the movement. In 1961 Ducker moved from the Ironworkers to the Labor Council of New South Wales, becoming first an organiser and in 1975 becoming Secretary. In 1972 he was appointed a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was also President of the New South Wales Labor Party and vice-president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In these positions he supported successive New South Wales Labor leaders such as Pat Hills, Neville Wran and Barrie Unsworth (also a Catholic convert). In 1973 he was the main organiser of the leadership coup which replaced Hills as leader with Wran, who went on to become Premier of New South Wales for ten years. Ducker was also a powerful supporter of Federal Labor Leader Gough Whitlam in his battles with the left wing of the Labor Party during the 1960s. In 1970 Ducker was a leading figure in the internal crisis in the Labor Party that cemented Whitlam's leadership. Convinced of the need to remove the left-wing controllers of the Victorian branch of the party if Labor was to win the 1972 federal election, Ducker did a deal with the left-wing leader Clyde Cameron, under which the right shared power with the left in the New South Wales branch in exchange for Cameron's support for the reform of the Victorian branch. He had a long association with Mater Maria Catholic College In 1979 Ducker's health declined and he resigned all his official positions, but Wran appointed him Chairman of the New South Wales Public Service Board. He remained a powerful influence behind the scenes, supporting younger Labor leaders such as Graham Richardson, Bob Carr and Paul Keating. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1979, and the Catholic Church awarded him a Papal knighthood. He was also appointed to several company boards, including Qantas and the poker machine giant Aristocrat Leisure Industries.",

  "text" : "John Douglas (6 mars 1828 - 23 juillet 1904) était un homme politique australien d'origine britannique et le septième premier ministre du Queensland. Douglas est né à Londres. Il était le septième fils d'Henry Alexander Douglas et d'Elizabeth Dalzell, son épouse. Ses parents sont morts en 1837 et il a fait ses études à Harrow et à l'Université de Durham, où il a également obtenu son baccalauréat en arts en 1850. On raconte qu'il a fait ses études à Rugby School mais son nom ne figure pas dans la liste de l'école de son époque. Il est arrivé en Nouvelle-Galles du Sud en 1851 et a été nommé commissaire des mines d'or, mais il démissionna pour devenir fermier. Il fut ensuite élu député de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud dans la circonscription de Darling Downs puis de Camden avant de démissionner le 17 juillet 1861. Il s'installa au Queensland en 1863 et fut élu député de Port Curtis. Le 1er mars 1866, il devint Postmaster General dans le premier gouvernement d'Arthur Macalister. Il fut nommé par la suite sénateur mais fut élu par la suite député de la nouvelle circonscription des Downs est. Il obtint le portefeuille de ministre des finances dans le second gouvernement Macalister en décembre 1866, puis en mai 1867, celui de ministre des travaux publics. Il redevint postmaster general dans le gouvernement de Charles Lilley de décembre 1868 jusqu'en novembre 1869, date à laquelle il démissionna pour devenir agent-général (ambassadeur) pour le Queensland à Londres. En 1871, il retourna au Queensland et devint député de Maryborough lors des élections de 1875. Il fut nommé ministre des terres publiques dans le gouvernement de George Thorn de juin 1876 jusqu'en mars 1877, lorsqu'il devint premier ministre. Son parti fut battu lors des élections de janvier 1879 et Douglas abandonna la politique. Il fut pendant un certain temps dans la direction du Brisbane Courier, et en 1885 le gouvernement le nomma magistrat résident de l'île Thursday. Après le décès de Sir Peter Scratchley en décembre 1885, il devint commissaire spécial pour le protectorat britannique de Nouvelle-Guinée pendant presque trois ans, et montra ses capacités de tact dans ses rapports avec les populations locales. En 1889, il revint à son ancien poste sur l'île Thursday. Il se rendit en Angleterre en 1902 et à son retour, continua son œuvre jusqu'à sa mort dans l'île. Douglas a été marié deux fois, d'abord à Marie, la fille de J. Simpson, en 1861 puis, en 1877, à Sarah, la fille de Michael Hickey. Il eut quatre fils de son deuxième mariage, dont deux ont eu une carrière distinguée. Le plus jeune, Robert Johnstone Douglas, (1883-1972), a été nommé juge de la cour suprême du Queensland en 1923 et l'aîné, Edward Archibald Douglas, (1877-1947), a été nommé à un poste similaire, en mars 1929. Alex Douglas, le nouveau député de Gaven est son arrière-petit-fils.",

  "text" : "Johannes Marijnus Antonius Maria (Jan) de Wit (Zevenbergen, 10 mei 1945) is een Nederlands voormalig politicus voor de SP. De Wit was aanvankelijk advocaat en procureur. In zijn woonplaats Heerlen vergaarde hij grote bekendheid met het Actiecomité Ereschuld Mijnwerkers. De SP-afdeling in die plaats werd een van de grootste van Nederland. Van 1982 tot 1996 was De Wit gemeenteraadslid in Heerlen. Van 1995 tot 1998 zat hij in de Eerste Kamer. In 1998 werd hij lid van de Tweede Kamer, waar hij zich vooral bezighield met Justitie, Binnenlandse Zaken en Asielbeleid. Hij zat namens de SP in de parlementaire enquêtecommissie Bouwnijverheid (2002-2003). Hij hield zijn maidenspeech op 17 juni 1998 over het wetsvoorstel Wijziging van de artikelen 140 en 443 van het Wetboek van Strafrecht (Kamerstukken 25638). Hij was voorzitter van de vaste Kamercommissie voor Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid. Zijn vrouw, Riet de Wit was wethouder in Heerlen en regiovoorzitter van de SP in Zuid-Limburg. Bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2006 stond De Wit vierde op de kandidatenlijst van de SP. Hij haalde 9163 stemmen. Op 24 juni 2009 werd Jan de Wit voorzitter van de Tijdelijke commissie onderzoek financieel stelsel, die de oorzaken van de kredietcrisis ging onderzoeken. Deze, vanwege zijn voorzitterschap ook wel de commissie-De Wit genoemde, Tweede Kamercommissie begon op 18 januari 2010 met de openbare verhoren. Op 10 mei 2010 presenteerde De Wit het eerste rapport van de commissie. Dit ging in op de oorzaken van de crisis. Het tweede deel van het onderzoek, dat later dat jaar plaatsvond, ging over het handelen van kabinet en Tweede Kamer. Op 7 november 2011 begon de enquêtecommissie Parlementaire enquête naar het Financieel Stelsel, waar Jan de Wit voorzitter van was, met de openbare verhoren van diverse hoofdrolspelers ten tijde van de kredietcrisis. Op zijn initiatief werd het verbod op godslastering geschrapt. Op 1 april 2014 verliet De Wit de Tweede Kamer en ging met pensioen.",

  "text" : "John Parkin Taylor (1812 – 12 August 1875) was a 19th-century New Zealand runholder, and a politician in Otago and Southland. In his early life, Taylor lived in various countries and studied languages in Germany. He worked as a merchant and got married when he returned to England. Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

First elected in 1990, he was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002. A Democrat, he represented the old District 24 prior to the 2002 redistricting, and the current District 23 thereafter. The district included portions of Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Sibley and Waseca counties in the south central part of the state. Hottinger served as a majority whip from 1993 to 2000, and as an assistant majority leader during the 2001–02 biennium. He was chosen majority leader in 2003 after Senator Roger Moe retired to run for governor. After a difficult year, in which the DFL Party majority was seen to have been outmaneuvered by Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty, Hottinger stepped down, turning power over to Senator Dean Johnson. In January 2004, he was selected the national legislator of the month by the Center for Policy Alternatives one month after Illinois legislator Barack Obama won the honor Hottinger has been quoted as saying the two of them have since taken “divergent” paths. The CPA praised Hottinger “…for disowning budget cuts and yet giving the GOP enough votes on the budget bills so that government would not be shut down, which would have imposed further pain on vulnerable Minnesotans and state employees.” The CPA added that he had \"strengthened the progressive community for battles in 2004 and beyond.\" During his time in the Senate, Hottinger chaired the following committees: Health and Family Security, Rules, and Early Childhood Policy and Finance division of the Finance Committee. He also chaired the Legislative Committee to Review Administrative Rules and Senate Subcommittees on Insurance, Consumer Protection, Rulemaking, and Higher Education, Senate Budget, Personnel, Ethical Conduct, Permanent and Joint Rules, Intergovernmental Relations and Property Taxes. Hottinger was active in the [Council of State Governments] (CSG) and chaired the [Midwestern Legislative Conference] in 2001. He became the national chair of CSG in 2004 in leadership partnership with Governor [Frank Murkowski] of Alaska who served as CSG President. He was the first Minnesota legislator or Governor to serve as the national leader of the organization other than Governor Harold Stassen who was National President in 1941-42. Hottinger chose not to run for re-election in 2006. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney.[3] He was suspended for a minimum of 18 months, petitioned to lift the suspension on June 17, 2010 and the Minnesota Supreme Court returned him to practice on January 12, 2011 finding him “prepared and morally qualified” to practice law. The Supreme Court decision  followed a hearing before the Minnesota Board of Lawyer's Professional Responsibility Board on November 18. 2010 and its unanimous decision to recommend reinstatement. There were no witnesses in opposition to the reinstatement and Hottinger’s eleven character witness included local attorneys and colleagues from the political world including DFL Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, former DFL Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, former Republican U.S. Senator David Durenberger and former Republican Party Chair Charles “Chuck” Slocum. After leaving the Senate, Hottinger worked for about four years as the chief consultant for some non-profit organizations funded by Minnesota-Washington philanthropist Ned Crosby: the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Process and Promoting Health Democracy in Minnesota and, on a limited basis, Health Democracy Oregon in Portland, Oregon. That work focused on Crosby’s Citizen Jury process for promoting citizen engagement through deliberative democracy. Hottinger was the Project Director for the Citizen Jury on Election Recounts concentrating on the process used in Minnesota in the recount of the U.S. Senate race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman in 2009. Hottinger was also a leader as the initial Vice President for Legal and Government Affairs for “The Minnesota World’s Fair”, the organization which launched the effort to bring the World’s Fair to Minnesota in 2022 or 2023. Hottinger has been active in non-profits including serving on the Executive Committee and as Chair of the Northstar (Minnesota) Chapter of the Sierra Club, a member of the Board and Executive Committee of the Northeast Midwest Institute in Washington, D.C. and as a member of the Board of the Somali Justice Center in Minneapolis.

Months passed and creditors grew tired of waiting in vain for a settlement, and violence soon followed. On August 6, 1835, a mob gathered and broke the windows of the house of Reverdy Johnson one of the bank's directors. Jesse attempted to protect his colleague's home, but was unable to prevent the destruction of that and many other bank directors' homes, including - eventually - his own.

He was a delegate for Connecticut to many sessions of the Continental Congress. Eliphalet was born in Windham and attended Yale where he graduated in 1740. He read for the law and was admitted to the bar in 1746. He became a member of the militia, then in 1747 was elected justice of the peace and a member of the colonial assembly. He was also involved in several of the land development schemes for the Susquehanna and Wyoming Valley areas. In the French and Indian War Dyer was a Lt. Colonel in the militia. He was a part of the expedition that captured Crown Point from the French in 1755. In 1758, as a Colonel, he led his regiment to Canada in support of Amherst’s and Wolfe’s operations. In 1763 he visited London as an agent for the Susquehanna Land Company in a failed attempt to gain title for a colonial venture to the Wyoming region. Connecticut sent Dyer to New York for the Stamp Act Congress. This congress of protest was an important precursor to the American Revolution. In 1766 he was elected a justice of Connecticut’s superior court. He would hold that post until 1793, serving as Chief Justice after 1789. As the revolution began, Dyer was named to the state’s Committee of Safety, and named a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1774. He would serve in the Congress during 1774–1775, 1777–1779, and 1782–1783. John Adams, in his diary, characterized Dyer as \"...longwinded and roundabout, obscure and cloudy, very talkative and very tedious, yet an honest, worthy man; means and judges well.\" Eliphalet retired from public life in 1793. He died at home in Windham on May 13, 1807, and is buried in the Windham Cemetery. His daughter Amelia was married to Joseph Trumbull, who served with Dyer in the Continental Congress.",

  "text" : "Earl Russell Browder (May 20, 1891 – June 27, 1973) was an American political activist, functionary and leader of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Browder is best remembered as the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s. During World War I, Browder served time in federal prison as a conscientious objector to conscription and the war. Upon his release, Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the Communist International and its Red International of Labor Unions in China and the Pacific region. In 1930, following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership, Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA. For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American Communism, authoring dozens of pamphlets and books, making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences, and twice running for President of the United States. Browder also took part in clandestine activities on behalf of Soviet intelligence in America during his period of party leadership, placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence. In the wake of public outrage over the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact, Browder was indicted for passport fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942 the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity. Browder was a staunch adherent of close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II and envisioned continued cooperation between these two military powers in the postwar years. Coming to see the role of American Communists to be that of an organized pressure group within a broad governing coalition, in 1944 he directed the transformation of the CPUSA into a \"Communist Political Association.\" However, following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Cold War and internal red scare quickly sprouted up. Browder was expelled from the re-established Communist Party early in 1946, due largely to a refusal to modify these views to accord with changing political realities and their associated ideological demands. Browder lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity at his home in Yonkers, New York, attempting with little success to influence American government policy and public opinion as the author of numerous books and pamphlets.",

Bij deze universiteit rondde hij in 1999 ook zijn politicologiestudie af. Irrgang werd in 1997 lid van de SP. Begin januari 1998 richtte hij samen met Elisabeth van der Steenhoven het Nieuw Republikeins Genootschap (NRG) op, als tegenhanger van het Republikeins Genootschap dat leden alleen toeliet door coöptatie. Hij was voorzitter van het NRG tot 2001. In 2001 trad hij terug als voorzitter omdat hij kandidaat-Kamerlid werd voor de SP. Hij was sinds 1998 beleidsmedewerker van de Tweede Kamerfractie van deze partij, met als portefeuille Financiën. Irrgang was ook lid van het afdelingsbestuur in Amsterdam, en maakte van 1999 tot mei 2005 deel uit van het partijbestuur van de SP. Op 29 september 2005 werd bekend dat hij het SP-kamerlid Piet de Ruiter per 4 oktober zou opvolgen. Irrgang, op dat moment werkzaam bij de monetaire afdeling van De Nederlandsche Bank, stond weliswaar op de twaalfde plaats, maar twee personen die hoger op de lijst stonden zagen af van een kamerlidmaatschap. Irrgang kreeg de portefeuilles Economische Zaken en Financiën, en Binnenlandse Zaken. Hij werd beëdigd als Tweede Kamerlid op 6 oktober 2005 en hield zijn maidenspeech op 11 oktober, tijdens een debat over de mogelijke onevenredige verhoging van de energieprijzen. Bij zowel de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2006 als die van 2010 stond Irrgang op plaats zes op de kandidatenlijst. Hij kondigde in mei 2012 aan zich niet herkiesbaar te stellen voor de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen in september dat jaar. Sinds september 2013 werkt Irrgang als technisch directeur voor de Nederlandse stichting PharmAccess in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Die stichting zet zich in voor betaalbare gezondheidszorg in Afrika.",

  "text" : "Emanuel (\"Manus\") Boekman (Amsterdam, 15 augustus 1889 - aldaar, 15 mei 1940) was een Nederlands politicus, demograaf, statisticus, schrijver en typograaf. Hij staat vooral bekend als bestuurder en wethouder van de Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiderspartij (SDAP) en voorvechter van kunstbeleid door de overheid. Hij kwam uit een geslacht van Amsterdamse joodse boekhandelaren (antiquariaat en nieuwe boeken) en was de oudste zoon van Maurits Boekman (1869-1942), aanvankelijk diamantslijper en Heintje Peereboom. Op zijn twaalfde begon hij als letterzetter. Al jong had hij belangstelling voor politiek, en met achttien jaar werd hij voorzitter van zijn vakbond, de Typografen Jongelingen Vereeniging. Hij was aanvankelijk een volgeling van Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis. In zijn vrije tijd studeerde hij hard, waardoor hij zijn positie van typograaf en later vertaler Engels-Nederlands bij drukkerij Binger gedag kon zeggen. Hij behaalde onder meer de middelbare akte staathuishoudkunde. In 1911 werd Boekman chef de bureau bij de Haveninspectie, en in 1916 chef van de afdeling Wiskunde en Statistiek bij de Rijksverzekeringsbank. Gedurende de vijftien jaar dat hij die functie bekleedde publiceerde hij vele artikelen over allerlei onderwerpen, variërend van statistiek en economie tot werkloosheid en alcoholmisbruik. Vanaf 1921 tot zijn dood in 1940 was hij voor de SDAP lid van de gemeenteraad van Amsterdam. In 1931 werd hij wethouder van onderwijs en kunstzaken tot 1933, en opnieuw vanaf 1935. In 1938 feliciteerde Boekman als lid van het bestuur van de SDAP het vorstenhuis met de geboorte van Beatrix op de VARA-radio, wat hem op een berisping van het SDAP-congres kwam te staan. Op 6 juni 1939 promoveerde hij aan de Universiteit van Amsterdam bij prof. H.N. ter Veen op het proefschrift Overheid en kunst in Nederland. Na een overzicht van de verhouding tussen overheid en kunst in de 19e en 20e eeuw, beschreef hij een toekomstig cultuurbeleid voor Rijk en gemeenten dat onder meer kunstverbreiding onder het volk en opdrachten voor kunstwerken bij nieuwbouw inhield. Bij de inval van de Duitsers in mei 1940 stond Boekman aanvankelijk op het standpunt dat gezagsdragers niet moesten vluchten. Later was het te laat om via IJmuiden weg te komen naar Groot-Brittannië. Op 15 mei 1940, de dag van de Nederlandse capitulatie voor de Nazi-Duitse overmacht, maakte hij met zijn vrouw en met het bevriende gezin van de socialistische econoom prof. Bob van Gelderen een eind aan zijn leven. In 1963 werd in Amsterdam de naar hem vernoemde Boekmanstichting opgericht, op initiatief van de Federatie van Kunstenaarsverenigingen. De Boekmanstichting is een onafhankelijk kenniscentrum voor kunst, cultuur en beleid. Boekmans proefschrift wordt nog steeds relevant geacht voor het kunst- en cultuurbeleid van de overheid.",

  "text" : "Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin. Willkie was born in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was initially employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C&S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&S, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&S's property for a good price, and gained public esteem. A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters – many youthful – enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces under Hitler rampaged through western Europe in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states. After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.",

When responsible government was instituted in 1848, Young hoped to become the first Premier but was passed over in favour of fellow reformer James Boyle Uniacke and Young became Speaker. However, Young succeeded Uniacke in 1854. His government was accused of overlooking Catholics and tensions with Catholics were exacerbated by Joseph Howe's rupture with Nova Scotia's Irish Catholic community over his recruitment of Americans to fight on the British side in the Crimean War. In February 1857, ten Catholic and two Protestant Liberals voted with the Tories to bring down Young's government. Young returned to power in January 1860 when the Tory government was unable to command a majority in the legislature after an election. In July, the colony's Chief Justice died and Young, who had long coveted the job, was appointed to the position by the lieutenant governor. He served as Chief Justice for twenty-one years and was noted for placing cushions on his chair so he would tower above his fellow justices. He died in Halifax in 1887.",

Dit huwelijk bleef kinderloos. Van der Kaay begon na zijn niet-afgeronde theologie- en zijn rechtenstudie als bediende in een boekhandel en werd in 1863 arrondissementsrechter in Alkmaar en in 1897 kantonrechter te Leiden. Zijn politieke loopbaan begon met het gemeenteraadslidmaatschap te Alkmaar en hij werd later, voor het kiesdistrict Schagen, lid van de Provinciale Staten van Noord-Holland. Als Tweede Kamerlid voor het kiesdistrict Alkmaar, van 1875 tot 1894, was hij een trouw volgeling van Kappeyne van de Coppello. Hij behoorde later tot de anti-Takkiaanse tegenstanders van te grote kiesrechtuitbreiding en nam als minister van Justitie zitting in het kabinet-Röell. Hij regelde in 1896 het faillisementsrecht en in 1897, samen met minister Van der Sleyden de Wet op de Kamers van Arbeid. Tijdens zijn ministerschap speelde de zogenaamde Hogerhuis-zaak, welke tot op heden wordt gezien als een voorbeeld van klassenjustitie in de toenmalige strijd tegen het socialisme. Van 1891 tot 1893 was hij voorzitter van de Liberale Kamerclub der Staten-Generaal.",

  "text" : "William Dyer (also Dyre) (1609–by 1677) was an early settler of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, a founding settler of both Portsmouth and Newport, and Rhode Island's first Attorney General. He is best known for being the husband of the Quaker martyr, Mary Dyer, who was executed for her Quaker activism. Sailing from England as a young man with his wife, Dyer first settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but like many members of the Boston church became a supporter of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, and signed a petition in support of Wheelwright. For doing this, he was disenfranchised and disarmed, and with many other supporters of Hutchinson, he signed the Portsmouth Compact, and settled on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay. Within a year of arriving there, he and others followed William Coddington to the south end of the island where they established the town of Newport. Once in Newport, Dyer was very active in civil affairs, holding a number of offices, particularly those using his clerical skills such as clerk and secretary. The political alignment of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport was in flux for the first decade of government there, and Coddington had gone to England to obtain a commission to keep the island independent with him as governor. By 1651 Dyer and others had greatly tired of Coddington's rule, and he was one of three men who went to England to have Coddington's commission revoked. Being successful, Dyer returned with the news in 1653, but his wife, Mary, who had been there at the same time, remained in England. Mary returned from England in 1657 after being there for five years, and had become a zealous Quaker convert. Banned from Massachusetts, she nevertheless defied the authorities and returned in 1659, being sentenced to hang, but getting a stay of execution while on the gallows. Her last trip to Boston in 1660 resulted in her execution and martyrdom. Following Mary's death, Dyer remarried, and continued his public service, while having some legal entanglements with William Coddington. He was dead by late 1677, though no record for his death has been found.",

He was named to the provincial cabinet in 1902 as Commissioner of Lands and Works but was dropped from cabinet soon afterwards because it was alleged by the opposition that he was an agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Wells was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1907. In 1907, he bought the Hume Hotel in Nelson from John Frederick Hume. Wells died in Vancouver at the age of 93.

  "text" : "Vincent Kwabena Damuah (* 1930; † August 1992) (auch: Osofo Okomfo Damuah oder Osofo Komfo Kwabena Damuah) war ein führender katholischer Priester, Theologe und Politiker im westafrikanischen Staat Ghana. Während der zweiten Militärdiktatur unter Jerry Rawlings war Damuah Mitglied der provisorischen Regierung des Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC). Damuah war Gründer der Afrikania Mission, einer religiösen nationalen Bewegung mit starken politischen Prinzipien und Zielen. Die Gründung der Afrikania Mission soll im Dezember 1982 stattgefunden haben. Andere Quellen nennen den katholischen Priester Osofo Okomfo Damuah als Gründer der Afrikania Mission im Jahr 1985. Hierbei handelt es sich vermutlich um die gleiche Person. (Osofo ist die Twi-Bezeichnung für einen christlichen Priester, Okomfo bezeichnet einen traditionellen Priester, der im Gegensatz zum Obosomfo nicht von Gottheiten besessen wird).",

She was appointed to the Senate on the recommendation of Prime Minister Paul Martin on March 24, 2005. Upon appointment, Dyck wished to sit as a New Democratic Party senator, but NDP spokesperson Karl Belanger immediately indicated that the party would not recognize her as a member of the NDP caucus: as the party platform specifically favours abolition of the Senate, it refused to confer legitimacy on the body by accepting Dyck; additionally, Dyck's membership in the NDP was revealed to have lapsed. Under the rules of the Senate, senators are free to designate themselves however they see fit, and Dyck changed her designation to say Independent New Democratic Party. On January 15, 2009, she joined the Liberal Senate caucus. On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Dyck, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus. Before being appointed to the Senate, Dyck was a neuroscientist with the University of Saskatchewan, where she was also associate dean. On March 12, 1999, Dyck, who is of Cree and Chinese heritage and was one of the first Aboriginal women in Canada to pursue an academic career in the sciences, was presented with a lifetime achievement award by Indspire. She continues to teach at the university as well as conduct research on a part-time basis. She is a member of the Gordon First Nation. In 2014 Dyck accused Conservative MP Rob Clarke, who is also native, of \"behaving like a white man\" by pushing the Indian Act Amendment and Replacement Act. She later said she recognized the comment could be hurtful.",

His title was \"Cecil Calvert, Second Baron Baltimore, First Lord Proprietary, Earl Palatine of the Provinces of Maryland and Avalon in America\". He received the proprietorship after the death of his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (15 April 1632), for whom it had been intended. Cecil Calvert established and managed the Province of Maryland from his home, Kiplin Hall, in North Yorkshire, England. As an English Roman Catholic, he continued the legacy of his father by promoting religious tolerance in the colony. Maryland became a haven for Catholics in the New World, particularly important at a time of religious persecution in England. Calvert governed Maryland for forty-two years. He also continued to be Lord Proprietor and Governor of Newfoundland for the colony of Avalon. He died in England on 30 November 1675, aged 70 years. He is thought to be buried at St. Giles-in-the-Fields Church, London, UK. The exact location of his grave is unknown, but parish records state he is buried there. A plaque commemorating Cecil Calvert was placed in St. Giles in 1996 by the Governor of Maryland. However, genealogists for Kiplin Hall state, \"A number of the early Calverts were buried at St Giles in the Fields, Charing Cross Road, London. We cannot yet be certain whether Cecil is one of them.\" This is possibly due to poor record keeping of Catholic burials or numerous outbreaks of disease that overwhelmed burial staff and led to confusion in parish registers .",

  "text" : "Craig Anthony Washington (born October 12, 1941) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Texas who served in the Texas State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. The son of Roy and Azalia Washington, Washington graduated from Prairie View A&M University in 1966 and was originally interested in becoming a doctor, but as admissions to medical school had already ceased, Washington decided to instead apply at Texas Southern University's law school. In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. \"Mickey\" Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the \"People's Five\"), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989. Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district. In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and still holds the seat today. Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas. On New Year's Day 2008, Washington shot at a car containing two teenagers. After being indicted by a grand jury in 2009, he agreed to two years of probation. However, Washington's attorney subsequently claimed that Washington fired because his life was in danger. Washington has since countersued the teenagers, alleging assault and property damage. The Internal Revenue Service has also sued Washington, alleging that he owes $610,000 in unpaid taxes. On January 8, 2015, Washington received a suspension of his Texas attorney's license. The 335th District Court of Bastrop County, Texas found that Washington had violated various rules, including the rules prohibiting neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him and failing to keep a client reasonably informed. On March 12, 2015, a \"modified judgment was entered imposing a four-year partially probated suspension with 12 months active.\" He was also ordered to pay over $24,600 in legal fees and expenses. Washington filed an appeal.",

Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election.

Calvert worked to reassert the Proprietary interest against the privileges of the colonists as set out in the Maryland Charter, and to ease tensions between the Lords Baltimore and their subjects. Religious tension, which had been a source of great division in the colony, was much reduced under his governorship. Captain Calvert was replaced as governor in 1727 by his cousin Benedict Leonard Calvert, though he continued to occupy other colonial offices. He suffered from early senility and died in 1734.",

The 3rd Lord Baltimore was a devout Roman Catholic, and had lost his title to the Province of Maryland shortly after the events of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which saw the Protestant monarchs William and Mary accede to the British throne. Benedict Calvert would make strenuous attempts to have his family's title to Maryland restored by renouncing Roman Catholicism and joining the Church of England. In February 1715 Benedict became the 4th Baron Baltimore upon the death of his father, and he immediately petitioned King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore died aged 36, outliving his father by just two months. Shortly afterwards the King restored the title to Maryland to Calvert's young son Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.",

As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes.",

Albert Trew, a district farmer. When the 'Lemsford Homemakers Club' was formed in 1920, she was elected first secretary-treasurer. She later became president of the Swift Current district Homemakers. In 1944 she was elected MLA for Maple Creek. Defeated in 1948, she returned to her active role in Homemakers and in the local church; she received a life membership in the Lemsford Homemakers Club. Trew was a member of the national council of the CCF for eleven years, and vice-president of the Saskatchewan section of the party for eight years. When the Saskatchewan Farmers Union was organized in 1950, she and her husband joined; she became women’s district director in 1953, and was elected women’s president of the provincial farm union in 1958, a post she held for five years. She represented farm union women at three meetings of the Associated Country Women. Trew was a member of the Thompson Advisory Planning Committee on Medical Care, which in 1961 laid the groundwork for Canada’s first universal medical care plan. The committee study took her to England, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. She died in a traffic accident on June 4, 1976. She is the grandmother of long-time Regina NDP MLA Kim Trew",

In April 2007, Schlozman left the U.S. Attorney position to work at the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. Schlozman and his office came under review by Congressional and Senate investigators regarding the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys and alleged inappropriate politicization of the Civil Rights Division. The Department of Justice Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility alleged that Schlozman had violated the law and made false statements to Congress about his hiring decisions. While Schlozman testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that his personnel decisions were not based on party affiliation, the report cited emails and other communications in which Schlozman discussed hiring \"right-thinking Americans\" and ridding the Civil Rights Division of \"pinkos\", \"commies\", and attorneys perceived to be unacceptably liberal. Federal prosecutors, however, declined to file charges of criminal perjury against Schlozman, drawing criticism from Senate Democrats. Schlozman resigned from the Department of Justice on August 17, 2007, and accepted a position with the Hinkle Law Firm in Wichita, Kansas.",

His mother's identity is not known, though one source suggests Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham. As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the American Revolution.",

Tevens was hij voorzitter van de Vaste Kamercommissie OCW. Hij is lid van een aantal raden van bestuur en toezicht. Hij stond in 2010 bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen namens het CDA op plaats 24 van de kandidatenlijst. Doordat het CDA een aantal ministers leverde schoof hij op, waardoor hij met een kleine onderbreking zijn Kamerlidschap kon voortzetten. Op 20 maart 2012 besloot de Tweede Kamer op zijn voorstel unaniem een parlementaire enquête in te stellen naar het stelsel van de volkshuisvesting, het beheer, het interne en externe toezicht, en de positie van de huurders bij woningcorporaties. Ook de rol van externe partijen zoals banken, toezichthouders en gemeenten wil de Tweede Kamer in de enquête betrekken. Het besluit van de Tweede Kamer vloeide voort uit de problemen bij de Vestia (woningcorporatie). Vooral werden als gevolg van de ontstane situatie bij Vestia vraagtekens geplaatst bij het toezicht op de hele sector. Sinds 1 april 2014 is hij waarnemend burgemeester van Weesp.",

Actuel vice-président du parti et député de la circonscription de Vaasa, c'est le plus jeune parlementaire de l'actuelle chambre. Depuis la fin de ses études secondaires en 2001, Puumala étudie à l'Université de Jyväskylä. Élu au conseil municipal de Kokkola dès 2000, il débute véritablement sa carrière politique en prenant la tête en 2005 de l'organisation de jeunesse du parti du Centre, l'un des trois principaux partis politiques du pays. Aux législatives de 2007, il reçoit 7 335 votes et est élu en sixième position (pour 17 sièges), un très bon résultat dans une circonscription historiquement favorable à son parti. Il intègre alors la commission des affaires culturelles et devient dans le même temps président du conseil municipal de Kokkola, capitale de la région d'Ostrobotnie-Centrale. En juin 2008, il est élu à l'un des trois postes de vice-président du parti du Centre, aux côtés de la ministre de l'environnement Paula Lehtomäki et du député Antti Rantakangas, devançant Mari Kiviniemi, la ministre des collectivités locales et des administrations. Les élections municipales d'octobre 2008 le voient conserver largement la place de son parti au conseil municipal de Kokkola, l'une des rares villes de plus de 30 000 habitants à voir une progression du Centre lors de ces élections, et ce malgré la concurrence des sociaux-démocrates emmenés par leur présidente Jutta Urpilainen.",

  "text" : "Rudolf Jung (16 April 1882 – 11 December 1945) was an instrumental force and agitator of German Bohemian National Socialism and, later on, became a member of the Nazi Party. Rudolf Jung was born in Plasy and went to school in Jihlava, a town fractured by national antagonisms. He was a civil engineer employed by the national railways of the Austro-Hungary. His party work took him from Vienna to Bohemia. In 1909, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP) (later in Czechoslovakia, DNSAP) and became an ardent party agitator. Because of his party provocations, Jung was fired but his party put him on their payroll and he devoted himself to theoretical work. Along with Dr. Walter Riehl, he drafted the Jihlava party program of 1913 \"which contained a more detailed comparison of international Marxism and national socialism and a more pointed attack on Capitalism, Democracy, alien peoples, and Jews. Here, anti-semitism ranked behind anti-Slavism, anti-clericalism and anti-capitalism.\"  In 1919, he completed his theoretical work Der Nationale Sozialismus. Jung expressed the hope in his introduction that his book would play the same role for national socialism that Das Kapital did for Marxian socialism. It is he that convinced Hitler to use the term \"National Socialist\" for the DAP's counterpart in Germany; Hitler originally wanted to rename the German DAP into the \"Social Revolutionary Party\". Some of the posts and honors he held were: President of the State Labour office in area Middle Germany, Gauleiter ad Honorem (honorary), and in 1936, Member of the Reichstag for the district Westfalia South. In 1943, he became the Reich Inspector and Director of the Reich Inspection of Labour Administration. He committed suicide in Prague's Pankrác prison before his trial for Nazi activities. He wrote several books including: Der nationale Sozialismus: seine Grundlagen, sein Werdegang und seine Ziele (National Socialism, its Foundations, Development and Goals), Aussig, 1919. 2nd ed.; Munich: Deutscher Volksverlag Dr. Boepple, 1922.",

He succeeded Donald MacDonald as the party's leader, after MacDonald lost his seat in the 1945 general election.He represented the electoral district (riding) of Cape Breton East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1945 until 1956.

Even though the CCF lost a seat, it was the first time they ever were the Official Opposition. Their successor party, the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party (NDP) would not duplicate that accomplishment again until 1998, over 50 years later. He was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia in 1904. Mr. Cunningham met and Married Violet Miller and had eight children. Shirley (Pettigrew), Joan (Roberts), Marilyn (Wheeliker), Robert, David, Donald, Clarence, and Kenneth. They began their wedded life purchasing the Bradbury farm on Big Glace Bay Lake.

Pannu was born in Punjab, India completing an undergraduate degree before immigrating to Canada in 1962. He settled in Whitecourt, Alberta, where he worked as a high school teacher until 1964. In 1964 he moved to Edmonton to work on a graduate program, completing a Ph.D. in sociology in 1973. He taught at York University for one year (1968–69) before returning to the University of Alberta, where he taught for 27 years until his retirement in 1996. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Alberta. He entered provincial politics in 1997 when he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. Raj became leader in February 2000 after the previous leader, Pam Barrett, retired from politics. Pannu ran a high-profile campaign in the 2001 Alberta election. T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Raj Against the Machine\", as well as a reputation as a \"likeable and honest politician\" contributed to his popularity and made him a leader well respected by supporters and non-supporters alike. He announced on July 13, 2004 that he was resigning as party leader. Fellow MLA Brian Mason, the deputy leader, became interim leader. Mason was formally elected leader in a leadership convention held on September 18. However, he sought re-election as an MLA in the 26th Alberta general election, and was re-elected by a wide margin. On June 14, 2006, he announced his retirement from Alberta politics at the dissolution of the legislature, which took place in February 2008.",

  "text" : "Rob Howard (born 1954 or 1955) is a Canadian politician who was elected to the 39th Parliament of British Columbia as the Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from the riding of Richmond Centre. A member of the BC Liberal Party, he replaced retiring BC Liberal Olga Ilich in that riding, by winning the riding in the 2009 provincial election. While his party formed a majority government, Howard was not included in Gordon Campbell's cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts in the first two sessions, and Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services in the third and fourth session. Howard introduced one piece of legislation, the Trustee Board of the Church of God, Richmond Municipality, B.C. (Corporate Restoration) Act, 2009 (Pr 402), to retroactively restore that organization's corporate status. As chair of the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, Howard supported Premier Campbell's efforts at establishing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Following Campbell's resignation, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon but Christy Clark won the leadership election. Clark eventually made Howard a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Transportation. In this position he advocated for Open Sky agreements and continued this advocacy in his post-political life by establishing the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada. Howard did not seek re-election during the 2013 provincial election and was replaced by BC Liberal Teresa Wat. Prior to his election to the legislature, Howard worked in property management. He served as a City Councillor in the Richmond, British Columbia for seven years. He was first elected to the Richmond, British Columbia City Council in the October 2001 by-election as a member of the Richmond Non-Partisan Association and was re-elected in the November 2002 and 2005 civic elections as a member of the Richmond First Party. He sat on council as an independent starting in 2006. While on council he advocated in favour of casino expansion, locating the Olympic speed-skating oval in Richmond, and developing a convention centre.",

  "text" : "Ruy Barbosa de Oliveira (Salvador de Bahía, 5 de noviembre de 1849 — Petrópolis, 1 de marzo de 1923) fue un importante escritor, jurista y político brasileño. Fue diputado, senador, ministro de finanzas e impuestos y diplomático. Por su participación distinguida en la Conferencia de la Haya de 1907, se ganó el apodo de «Águila de La Haya». Se postuló sin éxito para la presidencia de Brasil en 1910 y nuevamente en 1919. Ruy Barbosa dio su primer discurso público para la abolición de la esclavitud cuando tenía 19 años. Para el resto de su vida continuó una defensa intransigente de las libertades civiles. La Esclavitud en Brasil fue finalmente abolida por la Lei Áurea (Ley Dorada) en 1888. Parte del legado de Barbosa a la historia es su autorización, como ministro de finanzas en 1890, de la destrucción de la mayoría de los archivos gubernamentales relacionados con la esclavitud. Las ideas liberales de Barbosa fueron influyentes en el proyecto de la primera constitución republicana (1891). Él fue un partidario del dinero fiat, como oposición del patrón oro, en Brasil. Durante su mandato como ministro de finanzas, implementó reformas de gran alcance en el régimen financiero de Brasil, instituyendo una política monetaria vigorosamente expansionista. El resultado fue caos e inestabilidad: el llamado experimento fiat fue un fracaso totál. Un contragolpe ortodoxo siguió bajo el programa de Murtinho luego en la década. Uno de sus pensamientos más recordados: «De tanto ver triunfar las insignificancias, de tanto ver prosperar la deshonra, de tanto ver crecer la injusticia, de tanto ver agigantarse los poderes en las manos de los malos, el hombre llega a desanimarse de la virtud, a reírse de la honra, a tener vergüenza de ser honesto...»",

He was elected to the Parliament of Queensland for the electorate of Stafford at the 1983 state election. Murphy completed biographies on a number of Queensland ALP figures, notably Thomas J. Ryan and Bill Hayden. He was working on a biography of Andrew Fisher before his death. Murphy was diagnosed with cancer in 1983 and died in 1984, aged 47.

  "text" : "Donald Howard Yarborough (December 15, 1925 - September 23, 2009), was a liberal Democratic politician who was reportedly the first Southern politician to endorse the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yarborough, an attorney in Houston, Texas, ran for governor of Texas in 1962, 1964, and 1968. In 1962, he came close to winning the primary runoff election against John B. Connally, Jr., having polled 49 percent of the ballots. Other intraparty rivals, considered conservatives, included the state attorney general, Will Wilson, highway commissioner Marshall Formby, and General Edwin A. Walker, who made anticommunism the centerpiece of his race. The Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jack Cox, an oil equipment executive from Houston, was also a strong conservative and a former Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. Although Yarborough never became governor, his campaigns contributed strongly to the reform of the Texas Democratic Party, uniting, behind Yarborough's candidacy, traditional New Deal loyalists, organized labor, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and reform-seeking liberals, thereby enabling this coalition to capture local constituencies in the Texas House and Senate and build organizations later drawn upon by Mark White and Ann Richards. Yarborough was born in New Orleans on December 15, 1925. His father was the president of a bank in New Orleans that went bust in the Great Depression, so Don was sent temporarily to spend part of his boyhood living with an aunt in Mississippi, where he helped out picking cotton in the fields of his family’s farm with the laborers. His father eventually got a job with the government and moved the family to Washington, D.C. His family also spent time during the years after the Depression living with relatives in Coral Gables, Florida. The family eventually moved together to Houston when he was 12. His mother, Inez Black Yarborough, served as head of the Women in Yellow volunteer corps at the Jefferson Davis Hospital in Houston. Upon graduating from San Jacinto High School at 17, Yarborough enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, entered officer’s training school and became a Company Commander at the age of 19. He served one year in China at the close of World War II. After the war, Yarborough entered the University of Texas, where he belonged to Kappa Alpha fraternity, and worked part-time to supplement the money he received under the G.I. bill. He earned his law degree in 1950. Yarborough re-entered the Marine Corps to serve during the Korean War as a member of the Judge Advocate General’s Corp (JAG Corps). He then returned to Texas to found his own law firm and take part in civic affairs. In 1956, as president of the Houston Junior Chamber of Commerce, Yarborough won the national debating championship for the organization due to his passionate speaking skills. In 1960, Yarborough married his first wife, Katherine Edwards. In 1963, Yarborough was named by LIFE magazine as one of the 100 young Americans who were \"distinguished by their dedication to something larger than private success, because they had the courage to act against old problems, the boldness to try out new ideas, and a hard-bitten, undaunted hopefulness about man. In his first run for political office, Yarborough ran for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1960. In 1962, he ran for the first time for governor, and in a field of five Democratic candidates, he reached a run-off with John Connally and came within 28,000 votes of winning the nomination, a nationally-noted near-upset in a state long dominated by the conservative faction of the Democratic Party. He ran for governor again in 1964 and 1968. In political life he supported civil rights, economic justice, environmental protection, and women's equality, and he challenged the big business establishment that had long dominated Texas politics. After leaving politics, Yarborough promoted science as a means to ease suffering and cure aging, which he considered to be a disease that affected everyone. He worked as a lobbyist for Paraplegia Cure Research in Washington, D.C., where lived for many years on Capitol Hill and in Mclean, Va. He also played a role in the Council for a Livable World and was a founding member of biotech research companies. Yarborough died of Parkinson's disease on September 23, 2009. Yarborough was married three times, to Katherine Edwards Yarborough in 1960, to Gail Lind in 1978, and Houston realtor Charity O'Connell Yarborough in 1984.",

He served as parliamentary secretary to the Premier and to a Minister of Employment and Investment. He won election in 1991 by half a percentage point (less than 500 votes) but lost his seat in the 1996 BC election, by more than 10 per cent of the vote, to Katherine Anne Whittred. Afterwards, Schreck failed to win a councillor's seat for the District of North Vancouver and declared he would not again run in a political election. His term as MLA was his only successful bid after tries in the 1983, 1986, and 1991 provincial elections and the 1984 federal election. He publishes political commentary on his website, StrategicThoughts.com, and appears weekly on Victoria radio station CFAX with host Murray Langdon.His background is in economics. Schreck received a degree in that field from Grinnell College in 1969 and a Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia in 1978. In October 2011, his tweet, \"Is Premier Clark's cleavage revealing attire appropriate for the legislature?\" generated controversy and a reprimand from NDP leader Adrian Dix.",

Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens.",

  "text" : "Daniel C. Itse, known as Dan Itse (born May 21, 1958), is a conservative Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. A native of San Francisco, California, Itse is a professional engineer who resides in Fremont, New Hampshire. He advocates the revival of state sovereignty in an era of otherwise expanded government through the revival of the 1798 Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively, to permit the empowerment of individual states within the federal Union. Itse has explained his proposition on the national Glenn Beck interview program on Fox news. Itse's resolution in the New Hampshire legislature inspired other state legislatures to do the same (possibly as many as 20.) When he was eight years old, Itse moved with his family to Sherborn, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1976 from Dover-Sherborn High School. and then enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, from which in 1980 he procured a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering. He earned a master of science in the same field in 1986, also from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He is a registered professional engineer in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. From 1979-1989, he worked for the Riley Stoker Corporation. He was chief engineer of Physical Sciences, Inc., from 1989-1994. Since 1994, he has owned Christofferson Engineering. An inventor, Itse holds patents on (1) a low-emissions burner for coal-fired power plants, (2) a low-emissions combustion system for waste-to-energy, (3) a process for disposing of heavy metals, and (4) a device to enhance the injection of chemicals for reducing pollution from power plants. In 2009, Itse was working on the air pollution control system for the largest wood-fired power plant in North America. Since 2001, Itse has represented Rockingham County, which is located in the southeastern corner of the state, in the legislature, which meets in the capital city of Concord. He has served on the Children and Family Law and the Science, Technology and Energy committees. He once had the best attendance record in the legislature. He claims to vote in all cases in accordance with a literal reading of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, and personal liberty and property. In the 2011/2012 term he was the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification. In that term he saw the creation of the Committee on Redress of Grievances Chaired by Rep. Paul Ingbretson. The peoples right of redress as a positive right in New Hampshire was brought to light as a result of his commentary on the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, \"The People's Liberty\". An advocate of judicial reform, Itse supports constitutional amendments regarding the recognition of marriage, parental rights, prohibiting a state income tax, and affirming the right to petition the legislature for redress of grievances. He is a nationally prominent advocate of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the assertion of state sovereignty.Though his sovereignty amendment was rejected by his New Hampshire colleagues, it inspired similar proposals in some twenty states as well as the \"Tea Party\" demonstrations in April 2009. In 1979, while he was a senior in college, Itse married the former Lisa Mullins. The couple has five children, born between 1983 and 1995. The youngest, Jarrod, is handicapped. In the 2008 Republican presidential contest, Itse was a supporter of U.S. Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado. Itse is scheduled to address the national committee meeting of the Constitution Party to be held June 11–13 in Newark, New Jersey. In 2014 Itse authored \"States Have Powers - the Powers of the People, use 'em or lose 'em\" (available on Amazon). The book is an expository on his 2012 sovereignty resolution. It explains why the People are in fact in supreme power in America, and the intended distribution of power between the government of the United States and the States and between the three branches of government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial. At their 2015 Liberty Dinner, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance revealed that Itse was chosen as legislator of the year.",

  "text" : "Dirk (Dick) Dolman (Empe, 2 juli 1935) is een Nederlands politicus. Namens de PvdA werd hij in 1970 lid van de Tweede Kamer. Van 17 juli 1979 tot 14 september 1989 was hij voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer. Dolman was voordat hij in het parlement kwam ambtenaar op de ministeries van Sociale Zaken en Volksgezondheid en Economische zaken. In de Tweede Kamer hield hij zich aanvankelijk bezig met volksgezondheid. Vanaf 1973 was hij de financieel woordvoerder van zijn fractie. In 1979 werd hij voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer, als opvolger van partijgenoot Anne Vondeling. Dolman stelde zich onafhankelijk op, en had daardoor een groot gezag bij alle partijen. Hoewel de PvdA niet de grootste partij was bij de verkiezingen van 1981 en 1986 werd hij toch herkozen als voorzitter. In 1989 werd hij echter verslagen door CDA'er Wim Deetman met 75 stemmen tegen 68. Nog geen jaar later, op 1 juli 1990, verliet Dolman het parlement om lid van de Raad van State te worden.",

Kapitans played an important role in the history of the Chinese in Malaysia. They wielded considerable influence, contributing to social, economic and political development in areas under their jurisdiction. Yap Kwan Seng, of Hakka descent, was born in 1846 in the Chak Kai district of China. He moved to Malaya at the age of 18 and worked as a tin miner in Seremban. On his death, The Straits Times carried the following obituary: TOWKAY Yap Kwan Seng, the Captain China of Selangor, died at Kuala Lumpur on Friday, of consumption, at the age of fifty-five years, of which he had spent forty in the Straits. He came from the Canton province and had resided thirty-two years in Selangor. He had held the post of Captain China there since 1889. The deceased was popular among all classes and was a liberal giver to charities. He was a Trustee of the Victoria Institution to whose funds he liberally subscribed. He gave $10,000 to the Transvaal War Fund and also a handsome donation to St. Mary's Church building fund. He was always a good friend to his poorer countrymen, for whom he established a practically free dispensary. During the Pahang rebellion he rendered much assistance to the Government and was thanked for his services. He leaves behind him five wives here and three in China, also a large family consisting of fifteen sons and ten daughters.",

Député au parlement azerbaïdjanais, il en est le président le 6 mars 1992 lorsque le premier président de la République d'Azerbaïdjan, Ayaz Mütallibov, est contraint à la démission en raison des revers militaires subis dans la guerre contre l'Arménie. À ce titre, c'est Mammadov qui assure l'intérim de la fonction présidentielle. Il entreprend alors des négociations avec le président arménien Levon Ter-Petrossian, qu'il part rencontrer en terrain neutre, en Iran. Mal lui en prend : pendant son voyage, les forces arméniennes du Haut-Karabagh s'emparent de la ville de Laçın, petite localité coincée entre l'enclave séparatiste et l'Arménie, assurant ainsi une continuité territoriale entre l'Arménie et le Haut-Karabagh. Le parlement, fidèle à l'ancien président Mütallibov, rétablit celui-ci dans ses fonctions le 14 mai, mais le mécontentement est tel que dès le 18, Mütallibov est de nouveau chassé et Mammadov contraint à la démission.

  "text" : "Hilbrand Pier Anne Nawijn (born August 8, 1948) is a Dutch politician of the Party for the Netherlands (PVN). He was Minister for Integration & Immigration from July 22, 2002 until May 27, 2003 and later a Member of the House of Representatives for the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF). Nawijn was born in Kampen. The son of a burgemeester (mayor), he is a descendant of Firmin Navin, a French Huguenot who had fled to Holland in 1696 to escape persecution. After graduating Emelwerda College in Emmeloord he studied law at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. Following a long career working for the Dutch Ministry of Justice he was elected in 2002 as a member of the Christen-Democratisch Appèl for the city council of Zoetermeer. Nawijn was an early supporter of the openly gay, populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn and in 2002, when Fortuyn founded the Pim Fortuyn List, Nawijn earned a place on the list. Despite the assassination of Fortuyn by an animal rights activist, which happened days before the election, the LPF emerged with a successful result, thus bringing Nawijn into the Dutch House of Representatives. He was appointed Minister for Integration and Immigration in the first Balkenende cabinet. Due to the instability of the LPF following Fortuyn's assassination, the first Balkenende cabinet lasted briefly, leading to early elections in 2003. Due to Nawijn's controversial conservative positions such as his support of the death penalty, which horrified many people in the Netherlands, he was placed at the bottom of the LPF's electoral list. This should have made it almost impossible for Nawijn to be reelected, however, the same statements which made him so unpopular to the political establishment won him a following among voters. On election day Nawijn received enough individual votes to once again enter the House of Representatives. Despite still being a member of the LPF, Nawijn often was at odds with the party. In January 2005, he left the fragmented LPF with the goal of founding his own political party which conceptually would lean closer towards the ideas of the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang. Together with one of the leaders of Vlaams Belang, Filip Dewinter, in June 2005 he announced the founding of a think tank during a controversial meeting in the former house of murdered politician Pim Fortuyn. Marten Fortuyn, Pim Fortuyn's brother, called this action provocative, and \"I had expected otherwise from Nawijn.\" The influential Dutch magazine Elsevier writes: \"According to (the LPF member of parliament) Varela, it was widely known that Pim Fortuyn wanted nothing to do with Dewinter, who's party Vlaams Blok (resurrected as Vlaams Belang) had the previous year been forbidden due to racism.\" In the Dutch municipal elections of 2006, Nawijn managed, with his own new party, to gather 5 out of 39 seats in his hometown Zoetermeer. Later that year he entered the 2006 Dutch elections with a new party, the Partij voor Nederland (Party for the Netherlands), but obtained no seats. During his campaign, Nawijn voiced his support for accepting CIA black sites into the Netherlands in an interview in October 2006 in the Dutch newspaper Spits. In early 2007, Nawijn participated in the Dutch version of So You Wanna Be a Popstar?, broadcast by the Dutch commercial TV channel SBS6, granting him fulfilment of one of his dreams. He stated that \"Now that I have left national politics, I can do such things. An additional advantage is that it will keep me a bit 'in the picture'\". As a result of his performances at the talent contest, which were met with public ridicule, Nawijn signed up for a five-year contract as a singer. His first single came out in May 2007, Hey Jumpen, in the jumpstyle genre, and reached #45 in the Dutch Single Top 100 charts. In February 2008 he returned to his original career in law.",

Born in Sydney, the son of a convict sent to Australia for highway robbery, Wills is notable as being involved in several events in Australian history. He was also the father of Tom Wills, Australia's first great cricketer and inventor of Australian rules football. The Argus newspaper of 12 March 1921 records the Horatio Wills family being at Burra Burra Gundagai till around 1840. Thomas Wills, Horatio's son, was born in 1836 near Gundagai, New South Wales. Wills was one of the first settlers of the Ararat district in western Victoria, Australia, at a 125,000-acre (510 km2) property named Lexington near Moyston. Wills intended to build a house on the property which was finally completed in 1845. While at Lexington he is credited as having named nearby Mount Ararat. He hired aborigines as station hands and harvesters on his property. In 1852, Wills sold Lexington and moved to Belle Vue in Geelong. Wills was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for Grant on 10 January 1855; and was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for South Grant in November 1856, a position he held until August 1859. In 1861, Horatio moved north to Queensland, at Cullin-La-Ringo in the Nogoa region near Rockhampton. Just three weeks later, Horatio was murdered by aborigines, along with 18 others at the Cullin-la-ringo massacre, 17 October 1861; the biggest massacre of whites by Aboriginal people in Australian history.",

  "text" : "Herman Henry (H. H.) Kemper was an American-born farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan. He represented Gull Lake in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1934 to 1938. He was born on a farm in Hebron, Nebraska, the son of Frank Herman Kemper and Louisa Haulker. In 1906, Kemper found work with a survey crew working on the railway west of Edmonton, Alberta. He returned home later that year but, in the summer of 1907, he traveled north again and worked on a farm near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Later in 1907, he settled on a homestead south of Gull Lake. Kemper returned to Nebraska and married Mina Burwell in 1911. The couple returned to Saskatchewan later that same year. After working on a farm near Moose Jaw, they were able to purchase land not far from his original homestead. Kemper served on the rural municipal district council for Arlington. He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the Saskatchewan general election, 1934, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932. In 1935, it changed its name and officially became the Saskatchewan section of the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF. During the eighth provincial election on June 19, 1934, the FLG had five elected members come to office, including Kemper. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in Gull Lake in 1938 and in the Maple Creek federal riding in 1940. In 1953, Kemper sold his farm and retired to the town of Shaunavon. He died in a car accident near Tompkins while travelling to a CCF rally.",

  "text" : "Henry Theodore Titus (February 13, 1823 – August 7, 1881) was the founder of Titusville, Florida. He was born in Trenton, New Jersey on February 13, 1823. He was the first of nine children of Theodore Titus, and Catharine Flick Howell. He was raised in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. He was enrolled for some time at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but did not graduate. In 1845, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia. Titus was a leader of the Narciso López filibuster expeditions that invaded Cuba in 1850-1851. He was a grocer and sawmill operator in Jacksonville, until migrating with his family to \"Bleeding Kansas\" in April 1856 to join pro-slavery forces. He resided at \"Fort Titus,\" a double-log cabin one mile south of Lecompton, that came under artillery attack from John Brown's raiders on Aug. 16, 1856. He was wounded, captured, and exchanged for Free-State prisoners, before joining filibuster William Walker in Nicaragua in Feb. 1857. After his force was defeated at Castillo Viejo a few weeks later, Titus went to New York. He and his brother Elliot moved to the Sonoita Valley, Arizona, where they operated various ore mines during 1858-1860. Titus returned to Jacksonville during the American Civil War and served as assistant quartermaster in the Florida Militia. He was also working for the Florida Provision Company, a business owned by his father-in-law, Edward S. Hopkins. The firm sold supplies to the Confederate Army. While transporting a load of Confederate draft dodgers to Nassau in 1863, Titus lost his steamer to the Northern blockade and was captured on the Indian River. He eluded imprisonment and later returned to Florida with his family, preceding a post-war wave of newcomers. He moved to New York with his family in 1865, but returned to Florida in November 1867, settling at Sand Point which at that time had a population of 250. Titus built a sawmill, general store and hotel at that location. Titus was appointed postmaster, and soon thereafter renamed the settlement \"Titusville.\" The name of Titusville was determined by a dominoes game with Captain Clark Rice on October 16, 1873. He lobbied tirelessly to have Titusville named as county seat. His efforts were realized on October 7, 1879 when a vote was taken and the result supported relocation of the county seat to Titusville. He was also the Justice of the Peace, a notary public for Volusia County, and a marine insurance underwriter's agent. Rheumatic gout kept him confined to a wheelchair during the last years of his life.",

She was appointed Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development in March 2011. Chong was the BC Liberal MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. She was first elected in 1996 and was re-elected in 2001, 2005, and 2009. Born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia, Chong began her political career in 1993 as a municipal councillor for the District of Saanich. She ran her own accounting firm with business partner Karen Kesteloo and is a fellow of the Certified General Accountant of BC (FCGA). She was awarded a CGA-BC lifetime membership in September 2014. On September 18, 2014, Chong announced her intention to run for mayor of the City of Victoria in the November 2014 municipal election which she subsequently lost, coming a distant third to new mayor, Lisa Helps and previous mayor Dean Fortin. While Chong lost badly, it was widely speculated that she knew she could not win but instead wanted to ensure previous mayor Fortin, who ran a campaign primarily with backing of the New Democratic Party (NDP), would not win. Chong successfully set the ballot question based on Fortin's mishandling of the Johnson Street Bridge Replacement Project but simply did not have enough voters to make an impact. Fortin ultimately lost to Helps by a mere 89 votes. While Chong's running in a known left-wing municipal election after a long and successful career as a Provincial Cabinet Minister was baffling to many, the speculation is that Chong knew she could pull votes from the moderate Fortin, with a long-term strategy to strengthen the Green/Progressive vote in the region and province thus weakening the New Democratic Party by splitting the leftist vote.",

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014.",

In 1961, he married Lorraine Gay Cox. After his military service concluded, he became a restaurateur, caterer and salesman, and in 1984 was elected to Lake Macquarie City Council, becoming mayor in 1987. In 1988, he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an Independent, representing the seat of Swansea. He held the seat until his defeat by the Labor candidate in 1991, in which year he also lost the mayoralty. He continued to contest both state and federal elections, both as an Independent and (in 1996) as a member of the Liberal Party. Welsh died at Newcastle in 2007, and was cremated.",

  "text" : "Olav Meisdalshagen (17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party best known for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian Minister of Agriculture from January 1955 to May 1956. He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time, being elected for the first time in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death, except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament, and shortly after a parliamentary speech. A jurist by profession, Meisdalshagen came from a humble family background, growing up at a former crofter's farm in rural Nord-Aurdal, and losing his father in the 1920s. After studying he moved back to Nord-Aurdal, worked as an attorney and built the Labour Party organization in the region. The background formed him in that his main political goal was to improve the economy of dwellers in rural farming districts. He was a proponent of economic regulation, which marked his period as Minister of Finance. However, his period was also marked by the dominance of Erik Brofoss and the Ministry of Trade in deciding the country's overall financial policy. When Trygve Bratteli succeeded Meisdalshagen as Minister of Finance, the ministry regained its dominance, but also set out on a gradual deregulation. This, in addition to Meisdalshagen's discontent with increased spendings on defence, made him an oppositional figure within the Labour Party. He did return briefly to cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, and also cooperated with the government through the position as chairman of Norges Kooperative Landsforening, a national association of consumer co-operatives. However his oppositional tendencies grew stronger in his later life. He was a part of the \"Easter Uprising\" in 1958, and in 1958 and 1959 there were rumours of Meisdalshagen worked behind the scene to facilitate a change of personnel—and policy—in the Labour Party. His death came in this period.",

After graduating from the University of Tokyo with the B.L. degree, she became a lawyer in 1987. She is the deputy head of the SDP, vice-chairperson of the Socialist International (SI), the Visiting Professor of Gakushuin Women's College. Fukushima was also Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety, Social Affairs, and Gender Equality in Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's cabinet (16 September 2009 – 28 May 2010); the SDP was the junior partner in the DPJ-led government coalition. However, in May 2010 disagreements over the issue of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on Friday May 28, and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition. Fukushima's Social Democratic Party has an anti-nuclear platform, and she has been referred to as a prominent anti-nuclear activist. For three decades, she was at the forefront of an often futile fight against the utilities that operated Japan's nuclear reactors, the corporations that built them and the bureaucrats who enabled them. That situation changed with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011. She has opposed capital punishment on the SDP website. After a disappointing result in the 2013 election for the House of Councillors she announced her resignation as head of the party.",

He then worked as a salesman for a bakery in Sydney, Nova Scotia, forming a union and becoming its president. MacDonald was also involved in the co-operative movement helping to found the Reserves Mines Credit Union and serving as its vice-president. He served as a member of the Reserve Mines Volunteer Fire Department for over 60 years having helped found it in 1934. In the 1945 provincial election, he was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly representing the Nova Scotia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation for Cape Breton Centre. He and CCF leader Russell Cunningham were the only two Opposition members in the legislature until the 1949 provincial election. He would remain a member of the assembly for 18 years. MacDonald served as leader of the CCF from 1953 to 1963 leading the party through the 1956 and 1960 provincial election. Despite the fact that the party received almost 9% of the vote in 1960, MacDonald was the only CCFer returned either time. He stepped down as leader in 1963 and James H. Aitchison became leader of the newly formed Nova Scotia NDP. MacDonald lost his seat in the 1963 provincial election and the NDP would not gain another seat in the House of Assembly until 1970. MacDonald also continued his union work as business agent for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers from 1957 until his retirement in 1975 and was involved with the Cape Breton Labour Council and the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour. He also became active in municipal politics serving on the Cape Breton County Council from 1974 to 1976.",

He was chairperson of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (1983–1986), president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties (1985–1987), a member of the Criminal Law Sub-Committee of the Bar Association of Queensland and of the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council (1988–1989) and National President of the Labor Lawyers Association (1989). In 1989, Foley was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the Labor member for Yeronga. From 1992 onward, Foley served as Attorney-General of Queensland and Minister for the Arts, among other roles, in the Wayne Goss Government. In opposition from 1996-1998, Foley was Shadow Attorney-General. When Labor won government under Peter Beattie in 1998, Foley was appointed Minister for the Arts, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. At the 2001 election, his seat was abolished and he successfully contested Yeerongpilly. Judge Roslyn Atkinson has credited Foley, in his role as Queensland Attorney-General, with making the Bench more inclusive and representative of wider society, and specifically appointing more women to the Bench.  After the election, he became Minister for Employment, Training and Youth, keeping his responsibility for the Arts but leaving his legal portfolios. Foley retired from politics in 2004.",

He was appointed chairman of Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) in 1994.In 2003, he ran as a presidential candidate. Dikko Yusufu was chairman of Nigeria LNG in 1994 when a consortium led by Halliburton's KBR subsidiary was bidding for a contract to construct a LNG export facility in competition with the US corporation Bechtel. In a letter to Yusufu in September 1994, the oil minister Don Etiebet said that the NLNG board had \"seriously tinkered with the integrity of the pending contract award\". He considered that there had been breaches of commercial confidentiality, that may have benefited the consortium led by KBR. During a probe into alleged bribes by KBR, a London-based consultant, Mr Jeffrey Tesler said he had advanced money to Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu in the form of a repayable loan.The $70,000 loan was made during a visit by Yusufu to London in 1998 or 1999.Attempts were made to implicate US Vice-President Dick Cheney in the corruption scandal, which involved over $180m of bribes on behalf of a consortium led by Halliburton. Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu headed the Grassroots Democratic Movement in Nigeria during the period of transition to democracy launched by General Sani Abacha in 1997–1998. The organization had a left wing orientation.In 2000, he became chairman of the Arewa Consultative Forum, a Northern cultural and political association. After the April 2003 elections, both Muhammadu Buhari of the ANPP and Dikko Yusufu, who had run as presidential candidate of the Movement for Democracy and Justice (MDJ), challenged the election victory by President Obasanjo.However, in June 2003, Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu, said that defeated contestants who were not ready to go to court should accept their defeat in good faith. In November 2003, Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu said the grant of asylum by President Olusegun Obasanjo to the deposed Liberian president, Charles Taylor could not be defended on the ground of either justice or commonsense, and was therefore impeachable. MD Yusufu died on April 1, 2015 in Abuja.",

While the 18th district leans only slightly Democratic, having a Cook PVI D+4, Cardoza only faced serious competition in 2002, when he was first elected to the seat. This race is considered competitive in 2010 because of Mike's experience in local agriculture, his family name, and the current political climate. Berryhill comes from a Republican political family that's well known in the San Joaquin Valley. Mike’s Uncle, Clare Berryhill, served in both houses of the California State Legislature and also served as director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture under Governor George Deukmejian. His first cousins, Tom and Bill Berryhill, currently represent the 25th and 26th districts, respectively, in the California State Assembly. Mike was president of Young Farmers and Ranchers of California and elected to the Turlock Irrigation District Board. He also served several decades on the Ceres School Board, and, in 2005, Berryhill Elementary School was named in honor of Mike and other members of the Berryhill family who served on the school board.",

  "text" : "Myrthe Hilkens (* 31. Januar 1979 in Geleen) ist eine niederländische Journalistin und Publizistin. Hilkens studierte Journalistik in Tilburg und war zuerst als Musikjournalistin für verschiedene Magazine, zum Beispiel auch für die niederländischen Zeitschrift OOR, tätig. Sie wirkte danach unter anderem bei BN/De Stem mit, und am Tageblatt De Pers. Auch arbeitete sie für verschiedene TV-Sender. Zusammen mit ihrer Mutter stand sie in einer Sendung des Programms De wandeling der KRO vor der Kamera, zum Thema „Frauen und Sexualität“ (niederländisch: vrouwen en seksualiteit); zu diesem Thema erschienen von ihr mehrere Publikationen. Hilkens engagiert sich damit gegen Tendenzen, die sie als Pornofizierung (niederländisch: pornoficatie) des Zusammenlebens bezeichnet. Darunter versteht sie die Zuspitzung menschlicher Kommunikation und menschlichen Zusammenlebens lediglich auf Gesichtspunkte eines bestimmten Verständnisses von sexueller Attraktion. Mit der Sicht auf Sexualität in den einflussreichsten Pornos sei die Herabwürdigung der Frau zum bloßen Lustobjekt verbunden, so Hilkens. Auch gegen Gewaltpornographie sprach sie sich aus.Es sollen stattdessen, so Hilkens, in Darstellungen von Sex, zum Beispiel in Pornos, stärker die Frauen als Menschen mit Gefühlen und einem Willen, sowie Sex als Interaktion zwischen zwei gleichen Menschen gezeigt werden, die Identitäten der Männer und Frauen sollen eine Rolle spielen. Myrthe Hilkens kandidierte 2010 für die sozialdemokratische PvdA zum niederländischen Parlament. Vom 12. April bis zum 2. August 2011 war sie vorübergehend Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Generalstaaten. Von Januar 2012 bis August 2013 war sie erneut Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer.",

His ancestors emigrated from Spain and settled in Sarajevo 500 years ago when they fled the Spanish inquisition. In 1941, during World War II, Montiljo and his family were imprisoned at the Sarajevo camp. Montiljo later escaped to Dalmatia, where in 1943 he was again imprisoned, but this time at the Rab concentration camp. After successful escape in September 1943, he joined the Partisans. After the war, Montiljo attended and finished the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb. For more than 30 years he worked on the protocol and consular affairs for the Socialist Republic of Croatia government. He was engaged in international public law as a consultant and assistant foreign relations. From 1990 to 1992, Montiljo worked as assistant to foreign minister of Croatia. Montiljo founded the \"Croatian-Israeli society\", choir \"Lira\", and was active member of the Jewish Community in Zagreb before he founded the Jewish community \"Bet Israel\" with Ivo and Slavko Goldstein. For his cultural contribution, Montiljo was awarded with Order of Danica Hrvatska by President of Croatia Stjepan Mesić. Montiljo died in Zagreb on December 17, 2006 and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery.",

At the time of its closure the waste facility was the third largest in North America near the heart of Vaughan, the fifth largest city in the Greater Toronto Area. The waste landfill site became the centre of a 14 year battle between the citizens of Vaughan and both the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, which owned and operated the site. Mr. Ferri co-founded Vaughan CARES, an activist group that became prominent in the fight to close the waste facility. As a community organizer Ferri also contributed to numerous cultural organizations and helped organize large events, as well as administering community recreational facilities in Toronto, Vaughan and other surrounding communities. In his roles as a York Region Separate School Board trustee, municipal and regional councillor and deputy mayor he undertook several community campaigns and frequently acted as a spokesperson for the school board, the City of Vaughan and for York Region. In October 2014 Ferri was elected to his fifth term as a councillor for the City of Vaughan and his third term as a councillor for the Region of York, Ontario.",

The jury acquitted Calvert but he left England soon afterwards, and never recovered from the public scandal which surrounded the trial. Dogged by criticism and poor health, he contracted a fever and died in Naples at the age of 40.",

  "text" : "Frederick James Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton, CH, PC (23 August 1883 – 14 December 1964) was an English businessman, statesman and politician. A successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food, Lord Woolton became Conservative Party Chairman from 1946 to 1955. He rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Woolton also proposed changing the name of the party to the Union Party, but when that suggestion fell on deaf ears he instead emphasised a rhetoric that characterised opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour\". He is given significant credit for the Conservative victory in 1951, their first since 1935.",

  "text" : "Frances Nunziata is a Toronto city councillor for Ward 11 York South-Weston (representing one of the two York South—Weston wards). She is the sister of former Member of Parliament John Nunziata. An accounting clerk, she became head of the Harwood Ratepayers Association. She was first elected to office in 1985 as school board trustee for the City of York School Board. In 1988 she was elected to the York city council ousting incumbent Gary Bloor. On city council she rose to prominence as a whistleblower in the Fairbank Park affair. A deal had been made to sell part of the city park to a developer to build condominiums. Nunziata leaked material to the press illustrating irregularities in the process, leading to a police investigation of several local politicians. The affair pitted Nunziata against almost the entire York city council in a bitter debate. Nunziata took fellow councillor Nicolo Fortunato to court after he reportedly called her a \"slut\" and threatened to kill her. In the 1991 elections Nunziata was vindicated as six of the eight sitting councillors lost their reelection bids while Nunziata defeated her nearest rival by a ten to one margin. Eventually two York city councillors, one Metro Toronto councillor, and the developer were jailed over the affair. In the 1994 election Nunziata chose to challenge York mayor Fergy Brown. Nunziata was considered unlikely to defeat the incumbent, but after a spirited and often bitter campaign she emerged victorious. As mayor she ran into her own ethics issues when it was alleged she had used city money to pay a political operative. As mayor her main cause was an unsuccessful campaign to construct a subway line under Eglinton avenue. With the creation of the megacity in 1997 she was elected to Toronto city council. On city council she mostly concerned herself with law and order issues. She also was a prominent defender of Kimberley Glasco in her battle with the National Ballet of Canada. In 2010, George Berger, an executive assistant who worked for her in 2005 brought her before a human rights tribunal claiming harassment and discrimination during his employment. Berger claims that he was targeted due to a disability. Nunziata denies the claim. Berger is asking for monetary compensation and an apology. On December 7, 2010 she was nominated by Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday and elected as Speaker of Toronto City Council.",

  "text" : "Frank Arthur Cooper (16 July 1872 – 30 November 1949) was Premier of Queensland from 1942 to 1946 for the Australian Labor Party. He was born on 16 July 1872 at Blayney, New South Wales, the son of an English miller and his Irish wife who had immigrated to Australia. Frank was educated in Sydney and worked as a clerk in various capacities around Sydney, including the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church and the Westinghouse brake company. In the latter capacity he moved to postings around the country before settling in Ipswich, Queensland where the main railway workshops for the State of Queensland were located. Cooper joined the Brisbane Clerical Union and became involved in Labor politics in Ipswich, including as president and secretary of the Ipswich Workers' Political Union, and was involved in the eight-hour day movement in provincial Queensland. His political activities, particularly his support for workers strikes in the state in 1912, caused him to run afoul of employer and he was dismissed, and Cooper subsequently became a journalist and activist within the Labor movement. He became editor of the Queensland Leader, a workers publication in Ipswich, in 1915 and remained so until 1925. In 1915 he was tapped to run for the seat of Bremer in the Queensland Parliament, a seat based in Ipswich which he would hold for the next three decades. In 1924 he became an alderman and eventually deputy-mayor for Ipswich City Council. In 1925 he married Agnes Hardy. Cooper had joined the first majority ALP government in Queensland under T. J. Ryan shortly after his election and became a prominent and well regarded member of the administration. Labor went back to opposition in 1929 but Cooper soon distinguished himself as an effective debater and parliamentarian. His reputation was such that he became Assistant Treasurer and Secretary for Public Instruction upon the election of William Forgan Smith as premier of a new ALP government in 1932. By 1938 Cooper was sitting on the Queensland ALP's central executive and was treasurer. He excelled in the position: that year he delivered the state's first budget surplus since 1927. He became deputy leader of the parliamentary party in September 1940, and played a key role in preparing Queensland's resources and mobilization for the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific. In 1942, the Federal ALP government under John Curtin introduced uniform taxation which ended the system of dual income taxes levied by both the states and the Commonwealth, instead making the Commonwealth the sole collector of income taxes with grants to be given back to the states to compensate for any losses. Many states, including Queensland, challenged the law in the High Court but were ultimately unsuccessful. Although William Forgan Smith accepted the decision he resigned soon after, and Cooper was duly elected to replace him as Premier of Queensland. Although now in his 70s, Cooper was an ardent supporter of the Commonwealth's prosecution of the war effort and worked with Curtin closely, sometimes invoking the ire of his own party in Queensland. Cooper continued in the premier role throughout the war, however at the war's end he stood down in favour of his Treasurer Ned Hanlon. In retirement he was active in the Anglican synod and on the senate of the University of Queensland, and died at his home in 1949. Cooper was accorded a State funeral which took place from St John's Cathedral to the Mount Thompson crematorium.",

The ward structure at the time was such that the two candidates who received the most votes were elected in each riding. He was elected along with Brian Ashton. Fellow Scarborough city councillor Fred Johnson came in third. He has chaired the Planning and Transportation Committee. A centrist, he was aligned with the Liberal Party.

Pillitteri is a member of the Liberal party who first bid for the Niagara Falls electoral district in 1988. He lost to Conservative candidate Rob Nicholson in that election by a narrow margin of only 1,940 votes. After a second attempt in the 1993 general election, he defeated Nicholson by 10,823 votes and joined the federal Parliament and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. He therefore served in the 35th, 36th and 37th Canadian Parliaments. Pillitteri is currently the longest serving consecutive Member of Parliament the Niagara Falls riding has ever had. Pillitteri left federal politics in 2004 and did not seek a fourth term in federal office. Rob Nicholson decided to put his name forward to run as the Conservative candidate in the next election only once he learned that Pillitteri had retired. Nicholson regained the riding that year.",

The historic Ashai mansion now hosts a Girl's high school. Ashai's hut in Raj Bagh has been converted into a hotel. Popularly known as Ashai Sahib by his colleagues, political contemporaries and subordinates, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was the first Kashmiri Muslim to attain a bachelor's degree. In reward for his service and academic achievements, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah appointed Ghulam Ahmad Ashai as the first Registrar of the University of Kashmir, both for academic and administrative matters, from 1948 to 1953. He led the first convocation of the University of Kashmir at Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir) Park and was followed by a distinguished panel including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pro-Indian Sheikh Abdullah. Ashai's involvement with Kashmir University started when he was appointed as the Special Officer assigned with the responsibility of starting Kashmir's first university. Ashai spent the next two years touring universities across India building up strategic ties and relations with renowned and established universities. In the 1980 Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference government, in recognition of Ashai’s contributions as founding registrar designated the main road leading to the present university campus in Hazratbal as Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road. A commemorative plaque was installed at the entrance of the university, but it has since been removed. The family claims that illegal orders were given to have the plaque removed and the road christening annulled. However, according to official papers, the road is still legally named as \"Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road\".",

  "text" : "George Hume Steuart, (1700–1784) was a Scottish physician, tobacco planter, and Loyalist politician in colonial Maryland. Born in Perthshire, Steuart emigrated to Maryland in around 1721, where he benefited from proprietarial patronage and was appointed to a number of colonial offices, eventually becoming a wealthy landowner with estates in both Maryland and Scotland. However, he was forced by the outbreak of the American Revolution to decide whether to remain loyal to the Crown or to throw in his lot with the American rebels. In 1775 Steuart sailed to Scotland, deciding at age 75 that \"he could not turn rebel in his old age\". He remained there until his death in 1784.",

He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.",

  "text" : "Philip Theodore Sica (born September 27, 1934) is the President of Wise Choice Realty who, in 2005, made an unsuccessful bid for Queens borough president in New York City. He was the nominee for the Republican and Conservative parties ultimately losing to incumbent Borough President Helen Marshall. Sica's earliest education was at St. Stephen's Elementary School. Sica graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School. He then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts from Pace University (Government and Business), a B.A. from Atlantic Union College (Religion), attended New York Law School, and did religious graduate work with Andrews University. Sica served New York City in various capacities. He worked in the New York City Department of Hospitals, which is now called the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. He was a senior investigator for the New York City Department of Finance, a NYC Housing Authority Assistant, a detective-investigator for the Queens County District Attorney's Office, and Marshal for the City (mayoral appointment). In 1980, Sica's career changed when he became a minister of various Seventh-day Adventist Churches in the city. Prior to running for borough president, Sica ran for the State Assembly's 24th district in 2000, and lost to Mark Weprin (72% to 28%). Sica then went on to run for Council District 23 in 2001 and lost to David Weprin (Mark's brother) 69% to 31%. During his run for the Council District, Sica outlined his wishes to promote a reduction in crime, the lowering of taxes, and reform of the city's education system through increased investment by the state. In the race for the State Assembly, Sica received the support of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party, and the Right to Life. In his 2001 bid for the City Council, he was additionally endorsed by the Independence Party. Sica was unopposed for the Republican and Conservative parties' nomination in the race for Queens Borough President. Additionally, Borough President Helen Marshall ran unopposed for the nomination of the Democratic and Working Families parties. After counting the absentee ballots and affidavit ballots cast either for Marshall or Sica, the result turned out to be seventy-five percent for Marshall and twenty-five percent for Sica. Sica's strongest assembly district was A.D. 23 (comprising Howard Beach, Ozone Park, and Far Rockaway) where he garnered 39% of the votes cast. Sica is married to Naomi (Jungling) Sica, Ed.D. Sica has four adult children and four grandchildren. Sica is active in the American Legion, having served in the Army's Military Police. On September 18, 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to continue representing the Republicans of the 24th Assembly District in the New York Republican State Committee. In October 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and is again serving as its Chaplain.",

Dzhaparidze, étnicamente georgiano, se unió a los bolcheviques en 1898, partido en el que se ganó el apodo de Aliosha (Alesha), trasladándose entonces a Bakú, capital azerí. Ayudó a fundar el Hummet, partido socialista musulmán y fue elegido delegado de la Unión Caucásica del Partido Obrero Socialdemócrata de Rusia (POSDR) en el III Congreso del POSDR celebrado en Londres en 1905. Durante su vida política fue muchas veces encarcelado o exiliado por sus actividades anti-zaristas en el Imperio Ruso. Tras la Revolución de Febrero de 1917 se convirtió en miembro del Comité Regional del Cáucaso, uniéndose a la Comuna de Bakú y siendo uno de los legendarios 26 Comisarios de Bakú. Desempeñó varias responsabilidades en la comuna. Dzhaparidze, junto a Stepán Shaumián, Meshadi Azizbekov, Iván Fioletov y otros comisarios, trataron de expandir la ideología comunista a través de todo el Cáucaso. Poco después de la caída de la comuna, la noche del 20 de septiembre de 1918, fue ejecutado por un pelotón de fusilamiento en una remota localidad entre las estaciones de Pereval y Ajcha-Kuima del Ferrocarril Trans-Caspio junto a otros comisarios. Dzhaparidze fue uno de los cuatro principales comisarios que ganaron un notable estatus en la Unión Soviética como héroe caído de la Revolución Rusa. Una calle de Sochi (Rusia) aún se llama en su honor y posee un pequeño busto en Moscú. Su monumento en Bakú, capital de Azerbaiyán, fue demolido en 2009.",

A member of the Australian Labor Party, he was elected as the member for Gaven in the 2006 state election, defeating National Party member Alex Douglas, who had won the seat against Gray in a by-election earlier that year. In late 2008, Gray earned himself some bad publicity when he was accused of two separate instances of \"bullying\", both of them against elderly women. In the first instance he threaten to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray was forced to publicly apologise for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time. On this occasion, Douglas, running under the banner of the newly formed Liberal National Party, narrowly emerged as the victor. Following his defeat, Gray angrily slammed what he perceived as negative and \"biased\" coverage of him by the Gold Coast Bulletin.",

  "text" : "Pir Mazhar Ul Haq (Urdu:  پیر مظہر الحق ‎) is a politician in Pakistan who comes from the spiritual family of Bhan Syedabad and is a descendant of Makhdoom Moosa, 5th son of Hazrat Makhdoom Sarwar Nooh of Hala. Pir Mazhar who is considered one of the most loyal members of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has offered many sacrifices for the party. He has faced jail and exile as a result of the political victimization campaigns run by those governments who were brought in power (directly or indirectly) by the military dictators but he never compromised on principles. He joined the PPP when other activists had started jumping off the PPP ship after the imposition of Gen Zia's martial law in the late 1970s. During the PPP governments in 1988 and 1993, Pir Mazhar was inducted as minister for housing and town planning, and law and parliamentary affairs respectively. He is currently the Parliamentary leader of Pakistan Peoples Party in Sindh Assembly, a member of the Central Executive Committee of Pakistan Peoples Party and the Senior Minister in the Sindh Provincial Government, holding the portfolios of Education, Literacy and Criminal Prosecution Service. Pir Mazhar Ul Haq was first elected to the Sindh Assembly from PS-74 Dadu-IV in Dadu, Sindh, Pakistan in 1988 and has continued winning all the elections he has contested since then from this constituency. This is one of the most politically influential families of Sindh. His paternal grandfather was Pir Ilahi Bux who was nominated the Chief Minister of Sindh province by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Pir Sahib was always proud to have been nominated as the Chief Minister of Sindh by no less than the Quaid-e-Azam himself. He also remained minister for 10 years, holding the portfolio of Education. Pir Mazhar's maternal grandfather was Qazi Akbar who was one of the longest serving provincial minister in Sindh holding several portfolios including the Home department. His aunt (Qazi Akbar's niece) is Fahmida Mirza who served as the Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan. His uncle is Zulfiqar Mirza who is also Fahmida Mirza's husband served as the Home Minister of Sindh. His daughter Marvi Mazhar contested in the 2002 general elections from Dadu constituency and got elected as the first women member of parliament to be elected from Dadu District. His Son in Law is Jam Ikram Dharejo who got elected as a member of parliament (MPA) by defeating the Mahers of Ghotki (also one of the powerful political and tribal families of Sindh). His eldest son Pir Mujeeb is currently serving as member of parliament from the Dadu constituency. He is also the great nephew of Qazi Abdul Majeed Abid, who has held numerous Federal Ministries, including Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, and Federal Minister for Water and Power. Pir Mazhar is an articulate lawyer and if he had not jumped into politics, he would have been among the top lawyers of the country. He is also considered as one of the closest aides to the Late Benazir bhutto and her husband (current President of Pakistan) Asif Ali Zardari. During his more than three decades of association with the PPP, he suffered incarceration in 15 prisons (including the dreaded Machh Jail), Torture, kidnapping, and exile but he steadfastly clung to the party and did not succumb to any pressure put on him to change his loyalties. His eldest son Barrister Pir Mujeeb Ul Haq is an office bearer of the Pakistan Peoples Party in Dadu District and has his own law practice with the name of P.I.B. Law Associates having chambers in Karachi, Hyderabad and Dadu. He is also an elected member of Parliament from the Dadu Constituency. His second son Pir Danish Ali is currently serving Pakistan Peoples Party as its President in Dadu city which has been the ancestral constituency of the Pir family since before the independence of Pakistan.",

  "text" : "Peter Fenton (May 12, 1886 – October 5, 1953) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario from 1930 to 1932. He was the 17th mayor of Sudbury since its incorporation in 1893, and the first mayor of Sudbury after it was granted city status in 1930. On November 27, 1929 he was acclaimed mayor of the city due to the lack of candidates running for office in the 1929 election. In 1930 he stood again for mayor. During the election campaign he promised to build a new town hall and a subway under the Elm Street rail line, along with improving the local utilities in conjunction with municipal services. His campaign slogan was \"Sudbury is a progressive city; we should be optimists and boasters, not pessimists and knockers\". Fenton was widely regarded as a populist mayor and a worthy political opponent. On December 1, 1930, he won the election with 1,373 votes, the largest win in a municipal election in Sudbury at that time. He was successful at incorporating the city and building the Sudbury Jail, and did the best he could to enable the City of Sudbury to provide relief to citizens affected by the Great Depression. He converted the former jail into a flop house, and was able to provide relief to 4,142 recipients in December 1930. However, in an effort to encourage the recipients to \"find work\", meals were gradually cut back from three meals to one meal per day by March 1931. Despite his attempts at advocating for the impoverished citizens of Sudbury, his spending and confrontational style eventually thrust him out of office amid some controversy. Known for unilaterally making decisions on council and running a deficit, he was defeated in 1932 by W. Marr Brodie. Brodie was successful at demanding stricter practices in administering the city's welfare programs, the issue which cost Fenton the election. The ballots cast were 3,138 to 1,591, a clear margin of victory for Brodie.",

McNair was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and grew up in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania. His grandfather, David McNair, Sr., immigrated to Pennsylvania from Donaghmore, County Donegal, Ireland around 1733 and had Scottish ancestors from Loch Lomond. David McNair, Jr., Alexander's father (b. 1736), fought with General George Washington in the Trenton and Princeton campaigns in the winter of 1776–77, and died in February, 1777 as a result of wounds received in battle and exposure when Alexander was less than two years old. Alexander went to school as a child, and attended one term at the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania). He reached an agreement with his mother and brothers that the brothers would have a boxing match and that the winner would receive the father's property. Alexander was defeated. He became a member of the Pennsylvania militia and fought for the government in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1791 and 1794. In 1804, McNair traveled to what is now Missouri, the United States having just acquired it following the Louisiana Purchase. In that year he married Marguerite Suzanne de Reihle de Regal, the daughter of a French marquis. He lived in St. Louis, Missouri, participated in Freemasonry as a member of St. Louis Lodge 111, and served as a United States Marshal. He also became a successful businessman, and served two terms on the Board of Trustees of the Town of St. Louis, in 1808 and 1813. On May 24, 1813, Stephen F. Austin, who was later responsible for the colonization of Texas, and for whom Austin, Texas is named, was commissioned an ensign in the Missouri militia. Later in September, he enlisted as a private in the First Regiment of Mounted Militia commanded by Colonel Alexander McNair. McNair was elected governor in 1820, receiving 72% of the vote and defeating the famous explorer William Clark. After his time as governor, he worked in the Indian Department until his death. He died of influenza, and is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.",

  "text" : "Anthony Reed Herbert was a leading member of the British National Front (NF) during the 1970s, organising the party in Leicester and serving as its chief legal adviser (he was a lawyer by profession). Having previously been chairman of his local Young Conservatives, Reed Herbert became disillusioned with the Tories in 1972 when a Party Conference motion sponsored by Enoch Powell, condemning the government for admitting Ugandan Asian refugees, was defeated. He subsequently joined the NF and swiftly rose to the leadership. To counter accusations from the 'populist' faction of the NF that the leadership was too right wing, in June 1974 he was co-opted onto the NF's Directorate; not being tainted with a fascist past like so many of the NF leaders, he was acceptable as a moderate in the populists' eyes. As a consequence, it was Reed Herbert who cast the deciding vote which unseated John Tyndall as leader and gave the leadership to John Kingsley Read in 1974. Although he thus became associated with the populist wing of the party, he stopped short of joining the National Party when Tyndall regained control and the populists left, instead remaining within the NF. This is not to say that his views are moderate in the wider sense. He is quoted as saying: The immigrants and the British are racially and genetically incompatible, which is why immigrants must be repatriated. I wish them all the luck in the world, but not here.... I experience tension whenever I see a group of Indians walking down the street. I feel they are alien, a threatening presence. He contested the Leicester East constituency for the NF in the October 1974 general election, polling 2967 votes (6%). He also stood as NF candidate in the by-election for the Birmingham Ladywood constituency on 18 August 1977, polling 888 votes (5.7%) and forcing the Liberal candidate into fourth place. In 1979, Reed Herbert broke with the NF to lead his own British Democratic Party. He went on to merge the party into the newly formed British National Party in 1982.",

  "text" : "Ajay Chattradhari Daby (अजय छट्रधारी द॓बी), born 29 December 1955, is a barrister and the former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Mauritius. He did his secondary schooling at the Royal College of Curepipe. Called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1978, Ajay Daby studied in the United Kingdom and is a member of The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, London. He is married to Geeta Prayag, a laureate of the Queen Elizabeth College and doctor from the Sheffield University. Daby started his legal career as a private legal practitioner before joining the State Law Office as State Prosecutor, but only for a very brief period. He soon resigned from his post in the Judiciary to join politics. Elected MP of the PSM in 1982 in Flacq-Bon Acceuil, Constituency No 9 at the age of 26, he became the youngest MP in the country. He was further elected as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Mauritius. In 1983, he was one of the founder members of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). He was in the same year, re-elected MP of Flacq-Bon Acceuil under the banner of the newly created MSM and went on to become the youngest Speaker of the Commonwealth and Association des Parlementaires de Langue Francaise (AIPLF). He was re-elected in Constituency No 11 (Rose-Belle/Vieux Grand Port) and was called upon to take the post of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly yet again. In 1990, on a question of principle, Mr Daby refused to give the casting vote much needed by the then government to change the status of Mauritius to that of a republic and sever ties with the British Crown. He voiced his dissent with his leader and party on this question. The MSM - MMM newly formed coalition not having the required three-quarters majority to expel Mr Daby from his Speakership, went ahead to amend the Constitution to enable the removal of the Speaker by a simple majority. On 5 December 1990, the Constitution of Mauritius was amended accordingly. Mr Daby then joined the Mauritius Labour Party, but for a brief spell only. In 2001, Mr Daby was made Commissionner for Drug Assets Forfeiture under the Government led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth ,and later by Paul Berenger, until 2005, when there was a change of Government following general elections . Daby is back at the Bar and is regularly seen in high profile cases.",

Né à Carnot (Haute-Sangha), il servit dans l'armée française durant la Guerre d'Indochine avant de rejoindre les forces armées centrafricaines. En tant que commandant de la base militaire de Camp Kassaï en 1965, il aida Jean-Bedel Bokassa à renverser le gouvernement du président David Dacko lors du coup d'État de la Saint-Sylvestre. Bokassa le récompensa par la suite en le nommant ministre d'État et ministre des finances de son nouveau gouvernement. Banza établit rapidement la réputation du nouveau régime en forgeant de bonnes relations diplomatiques avec les pays étrangers, permettant au gouvernement de Bokassa d'asseoir sa légitimé sur le plan international. En 1967, ce dernier et Banza obtinrent même un soutien militaire de la France. Pourtant le président congédia Banza l'année suivante. Il devint alors du jour au lendemain très critique vis-à-vis du gouvernement, allant jusqu'à demander sa démission. Banza décida peu de temps après d'organiser un nouveau coup d'État. Il se confia à plusieurs officiers qu'il espérait rallier à sa cause et qui auraient été susceptibles de le soutenir dans ta tentative. L'un d'eux, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacta Bokassa et l'informa que le coup d'État était prévu pour le 9 avril 1969. Quelques heures seulement avant l'exécution du plan, Banza tomba dans une embuscade menée par Mandaba lui-même et fut directement mené au président Bokassa. Celui-ci le battit presque à mort avant que Mandaba suggère qu'il soit jugé pour décourager d'éventuelles tentatives de déstabilisation du régime. Le 12 avril, Banza fut présenté devant un tribunal militaire qui le condamna à être fusillé en une seule séance. Il fut mené dans un champ où il fut exécuté et enterré anonymement. Le Time et Le Monde ont proposé d'autres versions du déroulement de sa mort. Après l'échec de son coup d'État, sa maîtresse et ses collaborateurs les plus proches furent tous arrêtés et emprisonnés ou envoyés en exil. Après son élimination, Bokassa eut les mains libres pour développer son emprise sur la politique centrafricaine, ce qui le conduisit à se proclamer empereur en 1976.",

He was a secretary (minister) of the Ukrainian government, however he held a position that was assigned to the Russian minority representative. That was by the request of the Russian Provisional Government that demanded to have several members of Russian political background. Later after the dismissal of the first government and its reorganization in the next government Zarubin held two positions. Since July and until the end of fall he served as the state controller, beside his secretarial assignment as the secretary of Post and Telegraph services. Zarubin also was elected to the delegation together with Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Ivan Steshenko that was scheduled to meet with the government of Alexander Kerensky on October 21, which was accusing the Vynnychenko's government in separatism. Later that meeting was canceled due to the Bolshevik coup-d'etat. Further fate of the politician is unknown.",

  "text" : "Arjan El Fassed (Vlaardingen, 5 augustus 1973) is een voormalig Tweede Kamerlid voor GroenLinks. Hij stond negende op de kandidatenlijst van GroenLinks voor de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2010 en was daarmee verkozen. Op 17 juni 2010 werd hij geïnstalleerd. Hij was woordvoerder ontwikkelingssamenwerking, defensie, landbouw en digitale agenda. El Fassed werkte daarvoor bij Oxfam International, waar hij interim-hoofd humanitaire campagnes was. Sinds 2002 werkte hij bij Oxfam Novib als lobbyist en beleidsadviseur op het gebied van humanitaire hulp en mensenrechten. Hij hield zich met name bezig met internationale conflicten en mensenrechten. Daarvoor werkte hij bij verschillende internationale ngo's: Tussen 1996 en 1998 werkte hij als onderzoeker bij CPRS, waar hij zich bezighield met democratische transitie. Daarna was hij onderzoeker bij de ombudsman PICCR, dat zich bezighoudt met corruptie en mensenrechten in de Palestijnse gebieden. Tussen 1998 en 1999 was hij projectmedewerker bij het Onderhouds-Behoeftebepaling en Verwervings Traject van de Nederlandse landmacht. Tussen 1999 en 2001 was hij beleidsadviseur bij ICCO waar hij zich bezighield met de Hoorn van Afrika en het Midden-Oosten. Tussen 2000 en 2002 werkte hij bij de Palestijnse mensenrechtenorganisatie LAW. Over die periode schreef hij het boek \"Niet iedereen kan stenen gooien\". Terug in Nederland werkte hij als senior lobbyist voor Oxfam Novib en was hij interim-hoofd humanitaire campagnes voor Oxfam International. Tussen 1991 en 1996 studeerde El Fassed politieke wetenschappen aan de Universiteit Leiden, waar hij zich specialiseerde in internationale en vergelijkende politicologie. Daarvoor bezocht hij het Groen van Prinsterer Lyceum en de Van der Schaar-school. El Fassed ontplooide een aantal internetinitiatieven. Als een actie om aandacht te krijgen voor vluchtelingenkampen in de Palestijnse gebieden, kocht hij een straatnaam in een Palestijns vluchtelingenkamp die hij naar zijn eigen Twitteraccount noemde. Ook was hij voorzitter van Sendamessage.nl, een stichting die foto's van door Palestijnen op muren gespoten boodschappen verkoopt. Sendamessage.nl kreeg aandacht van CNN, Al Jazeera en Time Magazine. El Fassed werd in november 2010 bekritiseerd omdat neonazi's samenwerkten met Al-Awda, een mede door hem opgerichte organisatie. Electronic Intifada, een andere mede door El Fassed opgerichte organisatie, kwam onder kritiek te staan doordat deze gefinancierd werd door de Nederlandse hulporganisatie ICCO terwijl op de website van de organisatie de Israëlische overheid nazipraktijken wordt verweten en het zionisme gelijk wordt gesteld met de Holocaust. Sinds 2009 is El Fassed niet meer betrokken bij Electronic Intifada. Arjan El Fassed heeft een Palestijnse vader en een Nederlandse moeder. Hij is getrouwd en heeft drie kinderen. Zijn oom aan vaderskant was burgemeester van Nabloes. Deze raakte zwaargewond bij een aanslag. In 2008 verscheen zijn boek Niet iedereen kan stenen gooien: Een Nederlandse Palestijn op zoek naar zijn wortels en identiteit, over zijn eigen familiegeschiedenis en het conflict in het Midden-Oosten. Bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen 2012 stond El Fassed op plaats nummer 7 van de kandidatenlijst. Als gevolg van de verkiezingsnederlaag van GroenLinks keerde hij niet terug in de Kamer. Op 8 april 2013 is hij in dienst getreden als directeur van de Open State Foundation.",
