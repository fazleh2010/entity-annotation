  "text" : "Mohammad Yusuf Parray, better known as Kuka Parray, was a former MLA and a pioneer of counter-insurgency movement in Kashmir and the founder of Jammu & Kashmir Awami League. He was a Kashmiri folk singer, before he founded his pro-India militant outfit, Ikhwan-ul-Muslemoon that targeted top pro-Pakistani militants. His death was considered a major blow to the security forces against terrorism in Kashmir. The then Chief Minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, described the killing as \"a setback to the peace process\".",

  "text" : "Anne Roberts is a former journalism instructor (retired) and former Vancouver city councillor. She was elected as a member of the winning majority of Coalition of Progressive Electors in 2002. Before serving on the city council, Roberts was active in education issues as chair of her children's parent advisory committees and as chair of the District Parent Representatives at the Vancouver School Board, on which she was an elected trustee. In council, Roberts was among the five left-wing councillors dubbed \"COPE Classic\" by Charlie Smith at The Georgia Straight to distinguish them from \"COPE Lite\"—the three COPE councillors and Mayor Larry Campbell who split the party to form the centrist Vision Vancouver party. Chair of the Planning and Environment Committee, Roberts was appointed by council as a delegate to the Greater Vancouver Regional District. On council, she spearheaded expansion of child care spaces, advocated that transit money to be spent on buses rather than mega-projects such as RAV (now called the Canada Line), and convinced a majority of city council to deny Wal-Mart's application to build a new store. Roberts also opposed expanded gambling in the city and the 2010 Olympics. Roberts ran for re-election in 2005 placing 19th among 36 candidates with 41,739 votes, thus losing her seat.",
