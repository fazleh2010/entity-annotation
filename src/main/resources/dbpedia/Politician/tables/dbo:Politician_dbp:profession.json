Following his retirement from Royal Insurance, he became a private insurance consultant for a number of years. In the 1999 election, he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster as a Progressive Conservative and shortly afterwards became the New Brunswick Minister of Labour. In 2000, he became minister for the new Department of Training and Employment Development, a portfolio which encompassed much of his old labour portfolio as well as some social welfare programs and community colleges. McFarlane was defeated in the 2003 election and left the cabinet as a result. McFarlane lost his seat to Liberal Abel LeBlanc. McFarlane promptly returned to politics in 2004 when he was elected mayor of Saint John by defeating incumbent Shirley McAlary by a margin of over 25%. Ironically, one of McAlary's key backers was Abel LeBlanc. Mayor McFarlane faced severe and lasting criticism and allegations of corruption and incompetence for his role in granting Irving Oil tax concessions in 2005, concessions that have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.",

Ellis attended the University of North Carolina, studied law under Richmond Mumford Pearson, practiced law, and was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly from Rowan County.

Ellis was easily re-elected in 1860 over John Pool. As the American Civil War was beginning, President Abraham Lincoln requested troops from North Carolina to quell the rebellion. Ellis replied, “I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.” During the start of the U.S. Civil War Governor John Willis Ellis ordered cadets from the North Carolina Military Academy to Raleigh, North Carolina to serve as drill masters. Shortly after North Carolina seceded from the Union, Ellis died in office. The Speaker of the North Carolina Senate, Henry T. Clark, completed his term.

West admitted engaging in homosexual behavior with adults, despite an earlier record of supporting \"anti-gay\" legislation. Though never charged, he was removed from office by recall in 2005.

He was born in Boston on August 24, 1729 to Jonathan and Mary (Payne) Sewall. Sewall's father was an unsuccessful merchant who died at a young age. However through scholarships, funds raised by his pastor William Cooper and with the help of his uncle, Chief Justice Stephen Sewall, Sewall was able to attend Harvard. Sewall graduated from Harvard College in 1748, and was a teacher in Salem until 1756. He married Esther Quincy, a daughter of merchant Edmund Quincy. After studying law, he began a successful practice in Charlestown and served as attorney general of Massachusetts from 1767 to 1775. In 1768 he was also appointed Judge of Admiralty for Nova Scotia. In 1759 Sewall became a very close friend and patron of John Adams, the future second President of the United States. At the urging of Governor Francis Bernard, Sewall offered Adams the position of Advocate General in the Admiralty Court. Adams declined. A devout Loyalist, Sewall took his family to England in 1775 after a mob stormed his family home in Cambridge (he was subsequently named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of 1778). Adams, in his diary, grieved that his best friend in the world had become his implacable enemy. While Adams was assigned to London as a U.S. minister to the Court of St. James's in 1785, he looked up his old friend and they had a two-hour meeting. Both men were entrenched in their own ideas and no reconciliation was possible; Adams considered Sewall a casualty of the war. Sewall later served as a judge in the Vice Admiralty Court of Nova Scotia. He died in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1796. His son Jonathan later served as Chief Justice of Lower Canada and his son Stephen served as solicitor general for Lower Canada.",

The youth commission is considered as a city commission and allows 8 adults and 7 youth to join every year. Chase Middle School in Spokane is named after him.Note: Daniel K.

Born in England, he came to Canada and studied law before setting up a practice in Calgary. He became a prominent resident of that city, and served two years on its city council. In the early 1930s, he was one of the few prominent and respectable Calgarians to support William Aberhart's Social Credit League. He ran as a candidate for it in the 1935 provincial election and, when it won, was named Attorney General by Aberhart. Hugill's time as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was dominated by differences of opinion with Aberhart. Hugill did not believe that social credit could be legally implemented by a provincial government and did not support the government's attempts to do so. When asked by Lieutenant Governor John Campbell Bowen whether he considered three of the government's acts to be constitutional, he replied honestly that he did not; this prompted Aberhart to request his resignation. Thereafter Hugill was an outspoken opponent of the Aberhart government, though he did not seek re-election in the 1940 election. He retired from the practice of law in 1949, and died in 1971.",

  "text" : "Edson Jonasi Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF, was the Patriotic Front's spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-trained lawyer, and a poet. His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Eddison instead of Edson or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Edson Junior, Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily.",

  "text" : "Edmund Leverett Morris (4 February 1923 – 3 January 2003) was a Canadian politician, broadcaster and university administrator. Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Morris attended school at Saint Mary's Boys School. After graduating high school, he pursued an undergraduate and graduate degree in political science from Dalhousie University. After graduation he went to work for a local radio station in Halifax. He was married to Lorraine Ware and had six children. In the 1953 federal election, Morris made his first attempt into politics when he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the electoral district of Halifax. Although he lost, he continued to be involved in politics at the local level, and offered himself for election again in the 1957 election, in which he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada. Between 1957 and 1963, Morris represented the riding of Halifax in the House of Commons. He held the positions of Parliamentary Secretary to the Postmaster General, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Commerce. In 1963, Morris was appointed as chief assistant to the President of Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Saint Mary's, a Catholic university administered by the Society of Jesus, saw Morris serving as one of the few lay persons on staff. Morris was instrumental in large scale building programs at the university throughout the 1960s as well as the eventual change of the university to non-denominational institution in 1970. Morris served as Interim President of Saint Mary's University during the school year 1970–1971. Between 1974 and 1980, Morris served as Mayor of the City of Halifax. After stepping down as Mayor of Halifax, Morris, entered provincial politics by standing as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the urban riding of Halifax Needham, during a by-election, on 6 May 1980. Morris won the seat by 26 votes. Morris was re-elected in 1981 and 1984. Morris served as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Municipal Affairs, Fisheries and Social Services. Morris received an honorary degree, Doctor of Civil Law, from Saint Mary's University in 1986. Morris died on 3 January 2003, at age 79.",

  "text" : "Evald Rygh (* 26. Mai 1842 in Verdal; † 9. Mai 1913 in Christiania) war ein norwegischer Beamter und Politiker. Seine Eltern waren der Bauer, Lehensmann und Stortingsabgeordnete Peder Strand Rygh (1800–1868) und dessen Frau Ingeborg Marie Bentsen (1809–1878). Am 10. November 1870 heiratete er Sophie Arntzen (26. Dezember 1842–19. Mai 1913), Tochter des Stiftamtmanns Karelius August Arntzen (1802–1875) und dessen Frau Hanna Maria Gjerdrumine Arntzen (1808–1869). Sein Bruder war Oluf Rygh, ein zeitweiliges Mitglied von Det lærde Holland. Rygh studierte Rechtswissenschaften und legte 1864 sein Examen ab. In dieser Zeit traf er die Mitglieder des Studentenkreises „Det lærde Holland“ und betätigte sich auch als Verfasser verschiedener Zeitungsartikel. 1865 trat er eine Stelle im Finanzdepartement an. 1866 bis 1867 erhielt er ein Universitätsstipendium für ein Studium der Volkswirtschaft in Großbritannien und Frankreich. Von dort schrieb er auch Artikel über die französische Politik für das Morgenblad. Danach kehrte er auf seine Stelle im Finanzdepartement zurück, wo er 1869 Abteilungsleiter und 1872 Ekspedisjonssekretær wurde. 1875 wurde er in das „Formandsskab“ von Christiania gewählt und war 1892 bis 1893 Ordfører. 1879 erhielt er ein Angebot, in die Regierung von Frederik Stang einzutreten, das er aber ausschlug, weil er deren Auffassung in der Frage der Zulassung der Staatsräte zu den Stortingsverhandlungen nicht teilte. 1880 bis 1893 war er Bürgermeister von Christiania. Zu dieser Zeit war er auch in verschiedenen Ämtern, die sich mit dem Eisenbahnwesen befassten, tätig. 1882 wirkte er auch am Entwurf eines Nachbarrechtsgesetzes mit. Nach 1884 engagierte er sich stärker in der Politik und hing dem moderaten Flügel der „Høyre“ (der Rechten) an. 1889 bis 1891 war er Finanzminister in der ersten Regierung von Emil Stang. 1893 wurde er Direktor der „Christiania Sparebank“, eine Stellung, die er bis zu seinem Tode behielt. Bis 1893 war er auch Mitglied der Direktion der „Kristiania Hypotek- og Realkreditbank“, die er 1886 mitgegründet hatte. Er war von 1886 bis 1888 und von 1889 bis 1891 stellvertretender Delegierter und von 1892 bis 1894 Delegierter für Christiania im Storting. 1894 wurde er Vorsitzender des Vorstandes von „Selskabet for Norges Vel“. 1895 bis 1896 war er auch Vorsitzender des Komitees, das mit Schweden ein neues Handelsabkommen (Mellemrigslov) erarbeitete, dessen Entwurf im Wesentlichen auf ihn zurückgeht. 1885 sorgte er für die Gründung der „Christiania Telefonselskab“, der er dann vorstand. Als Emil Stang seine zweite Regierung bildete, war Rygh als Finanzminister begehrt. Aber trotz des Druckes auf ihn, dieses Amt zu übernehmen, schlug er diese Stellung aus. Das wurde sein Abschied aus der Politik. Er befasste sich nun in erster Linie mit der Leitung der Bank und übernahm verschiedene Leitungsfunktionen in Organisationen und Institutionen mit kulturellen und sozialen Aufgaben. So war er Vorsitzender des Vereins zur Errichtung eines Nationaltheaters und nach 1899 Direktor des Theaters. Er sorgte auch für das Erholungsgebiet in der Gegend von Holmenkollen-Voksenkollen. Deshalb steht in der Nähe der Wintersportanlage Holmenkollen seine Büste als Denkmal. Auch zwei Straßen wurden nach ihm benannt. Rygh wurde 1878 Ritter 1. Klasse des Sankt-Olav-Ordens und 1891 dessen Kommandeur 1. Klasse.",

  "text" : "Edward Allen Hannegan (* 25. Juni 1807 im Hamilton County, Ohio; † 25. Februar 1859 in St. Louis, Missouri) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker der Demokratischen Partei, der den Bundesstaat Indiana in beiden Kammern des Kongresses vertrat. Noch im Jahr von Edward Hannegans Geburt zogen seine Eltern mit ihm ins Bourbon County im Staat Kentucky. Dort besuchte er die öffentlichen Schulen, studierte die Rechtswissenschaften und arbeitete als Lehrer sowie als landwirtschaftliche Hilfskraft. 1827 wurde er dann in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen, woraufhin er nach Indiana umzog. Er lebte dort zunächst in Vincennes und Terre Haute, ehe er sich dauerhaft in Covington niederließ und dort als Jurist zu praktizieren begann. Politisch betätigte er sich in seiner neuen Heimat ebenfalls. Von 1832 bis 1833 saß er im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana, in das er später von 1841 bis 1842 noch einmal zurückkehrte. Zwischen dem 4. März 1833 und dem 3. März 1837 gehörte Hannegan dem Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten in Washington, D.C. an. Nachdem er in der Folge zunächst wieder als Jurist in Indiana gearbeitet hatte, zog er schließlich am 4. März 1843 in den US-Senat ein, wo er bis zum 3. März 1849 verblieb. Da ihn seine Partei nicht erneut nominierte, musste er nach einer Amtsperiode wieder aus dem Kongress ausscheiden. Während seiner Zeit im Senat war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Private Land Claims. Vom 30. Juni 1849 bis zum 13. Januar 1850 fungierte Edward Hannegan als Gesandter der Vereinigten Staaten in Preußen. Nach seiner Rückkehr war er wieder als Jurist in Covington tätig, bis er 1857 nach St. Louis umzog. Dort starb er zwei Jahre darauf an einer Überdosis Morphium.",

He settled in Oregon City, and was appointed Postmaster General by the Provisional Government of Oregon. T'Vault became president of the Oregon Printing Association, which was an outgrowth of the Oregon Lyceum, and published the first issue of the Oregon Spectator on February 5, 1846. He was fired from the Spectator after 13 issues. T'Vault claimed it was because of differences with other association members, especially George Abernethy, though the association claimed it because of T'Vault's poor spelling. T'Vault was a pro-slavery Democrat who became a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. The same year he was part of a group that urged the United States Congress to disallow the land claims of earlier White residents of the region, including that of John McLoughlin at Willamette Falls. The petition was partially successful and McLoughlin's claim was not recognized. In 1851, T'Vault led an exploring party of ten people from Port Orford in order to seek an overland route to the interior of the region. The party was ambushed by Native Americans and five members were killed, but T'Vault survived. He moved to southern Oregon and established the Table Rock Sentinel newspaper in 1855, and later the Oregon Sentinel in 1858. T'Vault represented Jackson County in the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1858, its final year, and served as speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives during its first session, in 1858-59. He advocated for the formation of an independent Pacific Republic and also practiced law in Jacksonville.",

Larry Campbell began his career in the army and was honorably discharged as a Sergeant First Class. Campbell served as the Republic leader from 1982-1990. Campbell is credited with engineering his party's 1990 takeover of the state legislature, which lasted 16 years. He began working as a lobbyist in 1995, immediately after the end of his legislative term. He was criticized for pre-filing a bill that benefitted a client, with whom he had signed a contract while still a legislator. In 1999, he was considered the most powerful man in Salem. He started the Oregon Victory PAC, which quickly became the biggest lobbying group in the state outside the major parties; it contributed over $750,000 to Oregon politicians in the 1990s. He drew criticism for campaigning on behalf of Republican control of the legislature during the 2007 legislative session.",

He as Leader of the Opposition in 1884. While in politics Semlin was instrumental in the building and operating of a boarding school in Cache Creek. The site was chosen there as Cache Creek was the midpoint between the Cariboo region to the north and the populated areas of the Lower Mainland to the south. He lost his seat in 1875 but returned to the assembly in 1882. In 1894 he became leader of the opposition and finally the 12th Premier of British Columbia in August 1898.

  "text" : "Cesar Epitácio Maia (born June 18, 1945) is a Brazilian politician, notable for having been elected three times for mayor of Rio de Janeiro. A native of Rio, born in 1945, Maia was forced to leave Brazil in exile during the 1960s on account of his affiliation with the Brazilian Communist Party. Exiled in Chile, he obtained a degree in economics, but the 1973 coup in the country saw him return to his native land. After becoming Professor of Macroeconomics at the Fluminense Federal University in the neighbouring city of Niterói, Maia became active in the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), founded by deceased left populist Leonel Brizola. Maia supported Brizola’s campaign to become Governor of Rio de Janeiro state in 1983, as Brazil was emerging from the military-led regime towards full democracy, and was subsequently appointed Treasury Secretary for the state. A trusted personal adviser to Brizola, who was instrumental in uncovering and denouncing the allegedly electoral fraud that threatened Brizola's gubernatorial election in 1982, the so-called Proconsult scheme, Maia was to be elected to the national Chamber of Deputies in 1986, and saw re-election in 1990. Meanwhile, having achieved personal political proeminence in the late 1980s, Maia broke with Brizola and the PDT, affiliating with the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) in 1991, being elected mayor of the city of Rio de Janeiro for the first time in 1992, defeating the Workers' Party candidate, Afro-Brazilian Benedita da Silva in a run-off election, in a campaign that was regarded by some as being driven by racist ideology. Maia subsequently left the PMDB and joined the Liberal Front Party (PFL).",

Llegando a ser a ser elegido diputado federal, alcalde de la ciudad de Fortaleza y con tan sólo 32 años de edad, gobernador de Ceará (1991-1994). Renunció a este último cargo, siendo el 6 de septiembre designado Ministro de Hacienda por el presidente de la República Itamar Franco (ante la renuncia de Rubens Ricupero). Posteriormente dejó el PSDB e ingresó en el más izquierdista Partido Popular Socialista (PPS) para postularse como candidato a la presidencia de la República en las elecciones de 1998 (el tercero más votado, siendo superado por el miembro de su ex partido Fernando Henrique Cardoso que consiguió su reelección en la jefatura del Estado) y en los comicios de 2002 (el cuarto más votado). En esta última ocasión apoyó a Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva en la segunda vuelta, la cual ganó. Ciro Gomes ingresó en el Partido Socialista Brasileño (partido de discretos resultados electorales)y aceptó el cargo de ministro de Integración Nacional en el gobierno de Lula, siendo responsable de la coordinación regional y de obras públicas. En marzo de 2006 dimitió en el ministerio para concurrir en los comicios parlamentarios siempre por el estado Ceará, siendo elegido diputado federal con la votación más alta (proporcialmente) del país, el 16% de los votos estaduales; en estas mismas elecciones su hermano Cid Gomes fue elegido gobernador de Ceará. Estuvo casado con Patricia Saboya, actual senadora y su aliada política; y con la famosa actriz brasileña, Patrícia Pillar de quien se separó en 2011. Actualmente se especula su posible candidatura para las elecciones presidenciales de 2010, debido a la alta favorabilidad de las encuestas (apareciendo en primer o segundo lugar) .",

  "text" : "Christopher Knudsen (4 October 1843 – 28 July 1915) was a Norwegian priest and politician for the Conservative Party. He was Minister of Education and Church Affairs from 1905 to 1906. Knudsen was born in Drammen as a son of railroad worker Knud Larssen (1814–66) and Marie A. Christophersen Aaserud (1812–1890). He was married twice; first from February 1869 to Marie Charlotte Andrea Hermanstorff (1849–1873), then from September 1874 to Ida Regine Lohne (1855–1949). He was an uncle of politician Knud Christian Knudsen. He finished his secondary education in 1861, graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1867, and in 1879 he became vicar in the newly established parish of Nedre Eiker. When Nedre Eiker became its own municipality in 1885, he sat in the municipal council and on the school board and was elected mayor. He left Nedre Eiker in 1886, and became a curate in Drammen. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from that city in 1894 and 1897. He was then elected for a third term in 1900 from the constituency Tønsberg, where he had been appointed vicar. On 11 March 1905, when Michelsen's Cabinet assumed office, Knudsen was appointed Norwegian Minister of Education and Church Affairs. This cabinet oversaw the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Knudsen left the cabinet on 26 January 1906.",

In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia, she sat on the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture and the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts, as well as serving as the opposition critic on the Employment and Income Assistance ministry, followed by the critic on child care, early childhood development, and women's issues. In the 39th Parliament she acted as a deputy speaker before returning to her role as critic on the children and family development portfolio. In the 40th Parliament, she was the critic on transportation and BC Ferries and, in that role, produced a report comparing the BC Ferries system with the Washington State Ferries system and introduced the Provincial Shipbuilding Act in both 2014 and 2015 seeking to have future ferries constructed in Canada. Originally from England, Trevena has a background in journalism having worked as a Canadian correspondent for British media. After she immigrated, she worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and then as a public information officer for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. After moving to British Columbia with her husband, she started her own business specializing communication strategies. She unsuccessfully filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal after being fired from a job because of her political affiliation. She was an advocate of renovations to the hospitals in Campbell River and Comox, opposing the health authority's plans to replace them with a new regional hospital near Courtenay. In November 2010, Trevena was one of thirteen party members to ask for a leadership convention, resulting in the resignation of Carole James as leader of the BC NDP. She endorsed John Horgan in both the 2011 and 2014 leadership elections.",

Young Scammon and created the Chicago Lyceum, the city's first literary society. By 1835, however, Morris had left Scammon and was practicing law with Edward Casey. He was elected mayor of Chicago in 1838 and went on to serve terms as a city alderman. He ran for the office of Illinois Secretary of State in 1852 under the Whig ticket and served as a Lake County Circuit Court Judge from 1853-1855. Following Evelina's death in 1847, he married Eliza Stephenson in 1850. Eliza died in 1855. The former mayor was outspoken in his opposition the American Civil War and was suspected to sympathise with the \"Copperheads.\" In 1864, he was arrested for aiding in a Confederate attempt to free prisoners of war from Camp Douglas. He was held for 9 months, but was then exonerated by a military court. Being unable, while so detained, to attend to his business affairs, he lost most of his assets through foreclosures. Incensed over the treatment of their ancestor, his heirs refused to permit the donation of his historical material, diaries, etc., to the Chicago Historical Society, despite urging to that end. The first use recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary of the phrase, to hell in a hand basket, is in The Great North-Western Conspiracy in All Its Startling Details, by I. Windslow Ayer, in alleging that, at a meeting of the Order of the Sons of Liberty, Judge Morris of the Circuit Court of Illinois said: \"Thousands of our best men were prisoners in Camp Douglas, and if once at liberty would 'send abolitionists to hell in a hand basket.'\"",

  "text" : "Brenda Kay Chamberlain, PC (born April 9, 1952 in Toronto, Ontario) was a member of the Canadian House of Commons, representing the riding of Guelph for the Liberal Party from 1993 until her resignation as of April, 2008. Chamberlain was a home daycare owner and operator from 1979 to 1983, and served as the administrative assistant in a family-owned business from 1984 to 1987. She also served as Executive Director of the Wellington County Literacy Council from 1989 to 1993, and of the Guelph-Wellington Career Educational Council from 1992 to 1993. During this time she also served on the Wellington County Board of Education (1985–1993). Chamberlain sought the federal Liberal nomination in Guelph-Wellington in 1992. Chamberlain's main challenger for the nomination was to be former Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Maine, who represented Guelph in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979. Maine dropped out of the race after the riding's nomination meeting was scheduled for an early date, arguing that this favoured Chamberlain. Chamberlain went on to win the Liberal nomination by acclamation. Maine later decided to run as an independent candidate against Chamberlain in the 1993 federal election. Chamberlain was elected handily as the Liberals took all but one of Ontario's 101 seats—the closest any party has come to sweeping the country's biggest province at the federal level. Chamberlain was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1997 and 2000. For many years, she was known as a strong supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party. Chamberlain won another easy victory in the election of 2004, defeating her Conservative opponent by nearly 10,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Guelph. Chamberlain was elected a fifth time in the election of 2006, in which the Conservative Party won a national minority government. She was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and was a vocal opponent of her own party's plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Chamberlain also voted against her party's same-sex marriage bill in 2005. She was also involved in legislation which forced Bell Canada to revise its 411 billing policy. Chamberlain served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour from 1997 to 1999, and was parliamentary secretary to the president of the Queen's Privy Council, with special emphasis on public service reform and Métis and Non-Status Indians, from December 2003 to July 2004. Although opposition spread rumours that she was about to retire she stood for re-election in 2006 and won handily. Just over two years later, on March 7, 2008, Chamberlain announced her resignation from the House of Commons effective April 7. She did not provide a reason for her resignation. During that election and thereafter the Guelph Mercury subjected Chamberlain to increasing degrees of criticism. Hansard will show that Chamberlain's last official votes occurred during the finals of weeks of February 2008. Subsequently, in a 2008 by-election Liberal candidate Frank Valeriote was elected in the Guelph riding. Brenda Chamberlain served locally as a school trustee and federally as a Member of the House of Commons. She was elected for twenty-four consecutive years of public service.",

Born in 1901, the son of a Lisburn solicitor, he was educated at The Wallace High School and Trinity College Dublin from where he graduated with a Law degree (LLD), and was called to the Northern Ireland bar in 1923. Having served in the Royal Corps of Artillery during the Second World War he entered the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1938 when he won the Lisburn-centered seat of Iveagh. He entered the Cabinet of Basil Brooke in 1945 when he became Minister of Labour. His stints as the Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Finance (de facto Deputy Prime Minister) left him favorite to succeed Brooke as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. In the early 1950s however, Maginess became a hate figure for the Orange Order when he banned marches through Catholic areas in Counties Down and Londonderry. Brooke demoted him to the non-Cabinet post of Attorney General in April 1956. While Attorney General, Maginess was party to the case of Attorney General for Northern Ireland v Gallagher [1961] 3 All Er 299, which remains authority in the law of Northern Ireland and England & Wales for the principle that Dutch courage is not a defence in criminal law. Counsel for Gallagher were future Attorney General and Lord Justice, Basil Kelly, and future Stormont MP and Chairman of the Criminal Bar Association in England, Richard Ferguson. In December 1959, Ian Paisley led a demonstration of Ulster Protestant Action members to Stormont Castle to protest at Brooke's refusal to dismiss Maginess and Sir Clarence Graham for making speeches at an Ulster Young Unionist Council event supporting Catholic membership of the Ulster Unionist Party. Having been appointed a King's Counsel in 1946 he was appointed a County Court Judge in 1964 when he resigned from Parliament. He died three years later in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital at age 65. A plaque in his memorial is cited inside the Church of Ireland parish church in Hillsborough, where he is buried.",

  "text" : "Thomas Joseph Campbell (14 December 1871 – 3 May 1946), known as \"T. J.\" Campbell, was an Irish politician, barrister, journalist, author and Judge. Campbell was born in Belfast on 14 December 1871. He studied at St Malachy's College and the Royal University of Ireland. He was awarded a BA in 1892, his LL.B in 1894 and an MA in 1897. In 1895, he began editing The Irish News, a local Belfast-based newspaper. In 1899, he was the Chairman of the Ulster District Institute of Journalists. In 1900 Campbell was called to the Irish Bar (King’s Inn) and the English Bar in 1904. In 1918 he was appointed as a King's Counsel. He became a Bencher of King’s Inn in 1924. Campbell was the first Treasurer of the Bar of Northern Ireland and first Secretary of the Circuit of Northern Ireland. A close friend of Joseph Devlin MP, Campbell was a supporter of John Redmond MP and stood for the Irish Parliamentary Party in South Monaghan at the 1918 general election. He lost the election to Sinn Féin's Sean McEntee (then in prison and later Finance Minister in the first De Valera led Government in the Irish Republic). \" A man of markedly moderate views\" **, in 1929 Campbell was appointed to the Senate of Northern Ireland. At the 1931 general election, he stood unsuccessfully for the Nationalist Party in Belfast West. In 1934, he was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland in a by-election as Stormont MP for Belfast Central, resigning his seat in the Senate. He was elected unopposed in Belfast Central in the general elections of 1938 and 1945. From 1937, he and Richard Byrne were the only Nationalist Party MPs to regularly attend the Stormont Parliament, and after Byrne's death in 1942, he was a lone voice against abstentionism in his own party. From the Senate in 1931 he successfully introduced the only nationalist sponsored Stormont bill, the Wild Birds Protection Act. Described as an \"old friend and political opponent\" by Lord Craigavon he was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Campbell has been described as having a \"Redmondite approach and rigid attachment to attendance and parliamentary etiquette (which) ruled him out as a unifying influence\" on his own party after the death of its leader Devlin. ** Campbell opposed the use of violence to achieve political ends throughout his political career. His book Fifty Years Of Ulster (1941) was mainly about his work as a barrister, but he also predicted the difficulties which would eventually befall the Stormont Parliament: \"If a minority anywhere are to regard themselves as condemned to be in a permanent minority in Parliament with no inducement to tempt ambition or ability into their ranks they will inevitably become discouraged and indifferent. A Parliamentary constitution depends on the continuance of parties and if this factor is eliminated the constitution will of itself cease to exist. Parliamentary government will fall into contempt. The system will collapse\". He said of his attendance at the Stormont Parliament \"I went there of duty, not of desire\". In November 1945, he resigned his Belfast Central seat and retired from politics in order to take up a position as a County Court Judge.",

He was a Winnipeg city alderman since 1899 before becoming mayor. When a rise in cases of typhoid fever in Winnipeg was discovered in 1904 by the municipal Department of Health, mayor Sharpe responded with an aggressive program to develop and enforce sewage and water services. His work as mayor also led to the establishment of Winnipeg's first Board of Control in 1906. In March 1906, he responded to a strike by employees of the Winnipeg Electric Railway Company with strikebreakers and then with armed militia, earning the mayor the nickname \"Gatling Gun Sharpe\". This incident was considered a precursor to the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike. After 1906, Sharpe did not seek another term as mayor and returned to business interests.",

  "text" : "Raymond John \"Ray\" Skelly (born July 1, 1941) is a former Canadian politician. A teacher by profession, Skelly was first elected as the New Democratic Party Member of Parliament for Comox—Powell River in the 1979 federal election. He served for fourteen years until being defeated in the 1993 federal election in the renamed riding of North Island--Powell River. This defeat was partly in response to the electorate's dissatisfaction with the provincial government led by New Democratic Party Premier Mike Harcourt. As a result, 15 of 17 incumbent New Democratic Party parliamentarians failed in their re-election bids in 1993. During his time in Parliament, Ray served as critic on a number of portfolios of particular concern to his constituents including Western economic development, fisheries, and mines & energy. He attempted a comeback in the 2000 federal election in Cariboo—Chilcotin but was defeated. He is the brother of fellow politician Bob Skelly. In the 1988 election, Ray and Bob pulled off a rare feat with both elected to the 34th Parliament and are currently the last siblings to have had the privilege to serve in Parliament together.",

He went on to study law and was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1861. In that same year, he married Emily Myers Wetmore. He served as a school trustee for several years and was clerk for the Westmorland County court from 1867 to 1870. Hanington ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature for Westmorland in 1870 but was elected in an 1870 by-election as a Liberal-Conservative. He was defeated in 1874 then regained his seat in 1878 and entered the cabinet of Premier John James Fraser as minister without portfolio and succeeded Fraser as premier in 1882. Hanington was sympathetic to Acadian rights and appointed a member of that community, Pierre-Amand Landry, to the senior cabinet position of provincial secretary. However, Hanington faced a leader of the opposition, Andrew G. Blair who had organised the Liberal Party into a powerful force. In 1883, Blair defeated Hanington's Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence and won the subsequent election. Hanington continued as leader of the opposition but was unable to defeat Blair's Liberals in the 1886 election. He remained in the legislature until 1896 when he accepted an appointment to the bench as a member of the province's Supreme Court. He was the presiding judge at the last trial of Tom Collins.",

In May 2007, Bushby was preselected for Tasmanian Liberal Senate ticket in the number two position ahead of the 2007 election. Consequently, Bushby appeared destined to enter the federal parliament at the beginning of the next Senate term in July 2008 given the highly electable nature of this position on the ticket. In fact his entry to federal parliament came sooner.

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with the Canadian businessman and politician Donald MacInnes.) Donald MacInnis (21 August 1918 – 9 May 2007) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the House of Commons of Canada. He was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia and became a coal miner by career. He was first elected at the Cape Breton South riding in the 1957 general election, defeating the long-serving incumbent Co-operative Commonwealth Federation member of parliament Clarence Gillis, also a former miner. MacInnis defeated Gillis again in a rematch almost a year later in the 1958 general election, known as the \"Diefenbaker Sweep.\" MacInnis remained a Member of Parliament throughout the 1960s and early 1970s except for the 25th Parliament when he was defeated in the riding by Malcolm Vic MacInnis of the New Democratic Party in the 1962 election. Since the 1968 election, MacInnis represented Cape Breton—East Richmond, one of the ridings which replaced the Cape Breton South electoral district in a boundary realignment. After his term in the 29th Parliament ended in 1974, MacInnis left national office and did not campaign for another term. From 1988, MacInnis served as the final Mayor of Glace Bay, a municipality which was dissolved in 1995 and replaced by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.",

She first won election to the House of Representatives in 1978, and served in the body until 1998. Long was elected as the first female Speaker of the House in 1992. Her tenure in that position was cut short due to the \"Phonegate\" scandal, in which members of the House of Representatives were found to be using state toll-free access codes for personal use. Long resigned the speakership in September 1993, but continued to serve until 1998, becoming the first woman to chair the House Tax Committee. After leaving the legislature, Long lobbied for energy independence, before retiring in 2007. She lives in Minnetonka, Minnesota.",

She has continued to be a New Democratic Party candidate in federal elections, running in Hillsborough again in the 1993, 1997 and 2000 elections, and in the successor riding of Charlottetown in the 2004 election.",

On 22 October 1903, when the second cabinet Hagerup assumed office, Hauge was appointed Norwegian Minister of Education and Church Affairs. The cabinet resigned on 10 March 1905 as a part of the build-up for the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden; Hauge did not retain the job. He did not return to Eidanger either, instead he became vicar in Skien. He changed job to dean in 1918, and retired in 1924.

  "text" : "Heath Nelson Macquarrie (September 18, 1919 – January 2, 2002) was a Canadian politician, teacher, scholar, and writer. Macquarrie described himself as a Red Tory, using the term in the title of his autobiography Red Tory Blues. During the October Crisis of 1970, he agonized over the implementation of the War Measures Act, and was prepared to vote against it, but relented for the sake of keeping the Tory caucus united behind Robert Stanfield. Writing in retrospect, Macquarrie described his vote in favour of the Act as \"fundamentally wrong\". He was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1957 federal election that brought John Diefenbaker to power. He served as a member of parliament for twenty-two consecutive years, until he was elevated to the Canadian Senate in 1979 on the advice of Joe Clark. He sat in the upper house for a further fifteen years, retiring at the mandatory age of 75 in 1994. He was publicly loyal to Clark's successor, Brian Mulroney, but privately disagreed with the government on several occasions, once saying during a caucus meeting, \"You know, a lot of people think I have a prominent nose because of my enjoyment of a certain beverage. Well, that's all nonsense. I got it that way by having to hold it so often while voting for some of Mulroney's bills.\" Macquarrie remained active following his retirement from the Senate in 1994, by contributing a column to the Hill Times and to newspapers in his home province of Prince Edward Island. Macquarrie was educated at Prince of Wales College, the University of Manitoba, the University of New Brunswick and McGill University. He studied for his doctorate at McGill, choosing for his thesis topic Robert Borden. He lectured at Brandon University and at Mount Allison University, in economics, political science and international relations. He edited and wrote the introduction to the published edition of Sir Robert Borden's diaries. An admirer of the World War I-era prime minister, Macquarrie considered Borden to be the architect of Canadian independence.",

  "text" : "Olav Meisdalshagen (17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party best known for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian Minister of Agriculture from January 1955 to May 1956. He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time, being elected for the first time in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death, except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament, and shortly after a parliamentary speech. A jurist by profession, Meisdalshagen came from a humble family background, growing up at a former crofter's farm in rural Nord-Aurdal, and losing his father in the 1920s. After studying he moved back to Nord-Aurdal, worked as an attorney and built the Labour Party organization in the region. The background formed him in that his main political goal was to improve the economy of dwellers in rural farming districts. He was a proponent of economic regulation, which marked his period as Minister of Finance. However, his period was also marked by the dominance of Erik Brofoss and the Ministry of Trade in deciding the country's overall financial policy. When Trygve Bratteli succeeded Meisdalshagen as Minister of Finance, the ministry regained its dominance, but also set out on a gradual deregulation. This, in addition to Meisdalshagen's discontent with increased spendings on defence, made him an oppositional figure within the Labour Party. He did return briefly to cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, and also cooperated with the government through the position as chairman of Norges Kooperative Landsforening, a national association of consumer co-operatives. However his oppositional tendencies grew stronger in his later life. He was a part of the \"Easter Uprising\" in 1958, and in 1958 and 1959 there were rumours of Meisdalshagen worked behind the scene to facilitate a change of personnel—and policy—in the Labour Party. His death came in this period.",

He was originally from Dublin, Ireland. He worked as a newspaper reporter in New York. He came to Portland with his wife in 1851. In Oregon, McCormick worked as a printer and publisher. In 1852, he opened a book shop in Portland, the Franklin Book Store. He began publishing a semi-weekly newspaper, The Portland Commercial, on March 24, 1853, but it was discontinued after a short life. He was elected as a Multnomah County delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention, held in 1857. He also served on the county commission and school board. He became a prominent publisher in Oregon, and his publications included the Oregon Almanac (originally known as McCormick's Almanac), Oregon Monthly Magazine, a city directory for Portland, and Abigail Scott Duniway's Captain Gray's Company (1859). In 1857, he was elected chief of the Portland Fire Department (established in 1854), serving for a brief period. He was elected mayor of Portland in April 1859, for a one-year term. During and after his term as mayor, he continued working in his main occupation, publishing. On May 13, 1859, he established another Portland newspaper, the Portland Daily Advertiser, which was only the second daily newspaper in the Pacific Northwest (the first being the Portland Daily News, which began publication less than four weeks before McCormick's Advertiser). It ceased publication – a suspension that became permanent – in October 1862. McCormick sold the paper before the start of the Civil War in 1861, the same year that The Oregonian became a daily paper. The Advertiser was pro-slavery and, according to a 1911 account by Henry Pittock, it took a pro-secession stance after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President in March 1861, causing the paper to lose influence in Portland, where the majority of residents were pro-Union. It ceased publication the following year. McCormick subsequently moved to San Francisco, California, where he became editor of the Catholic Monitor newspaper. In 1889, he wrote the book, The Pope and Ireland. He died in San Francisco in 1891.",

He served in the United States Senate from 1869–1875 and again from 1879–1881. Recognized as an authority on constitutional law, he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th century America. Carpenter presented cases before the U. S. Supreme Court involving such matters as states' rights and regulation of corporations. Originally a Democrat, he evolved into a Republican during the Civil War, and helped perpetuate the Wisconsin party's political machinery. His sustained support for President Ulysses S. Grant's administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden in the disputed presidential election of 1876 outraged many Republicans. A gifted orator, he was dubbed \"the Webster of the West.\"",

  "text" : "Marilyn Roman (born March 1936) is an American educator and Democratic Party politician who served as Acting Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. As City Council President, she became Acting Mayor succeeding Gerald McCann after his removal from office. Roman was the first woman to hold the office of mayor in the history of Jersey City. Roman attended New Jersey City University earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in urban education. She worked as a teacher and supervisor for the Jersey City Board of Education. Roman became involved in politics as a member of the Everett Terrace Block Association where she served as a representative attending City Council Meetings. At the urging of McCann, she was elected to the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1984 and served two terms. Running on McCann's ticket, Roman was elected to the city council in 1989. Roman was director of the Education-Business Alliance of the Jersey City Board of Education and president of the City Council when McCann was removed from office following his conviction on Federal fraud charges. Roman continued to fill the vacancy when the city council failed to elect another candidate after 30 days. Roman served as mayor for four months until the city council reorganized and selected a new Council President. Following the announced retirement of Congressman Frank J. Guarini, Roman organized and supported a slate of candidates in the 1992 Democratic Primary. She claimed to organize the ticket to support candidates for the Democratic County Committee farther down the ballot. Roman's candidates were opposed by a slate headed by State Senator Robert Menendez and supported by Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski. Menendez defeated Robert P. Haney by a ratio of 2-1, and Roman's candidates for Democratic County Committee only won one-third of the seats. The City Council of Jersey City reorganized on July 1, 1992 and selected Joseph Rakowski as the new president. Rakowski also became acting mayor and the third mayor in that year. Roman retained her seat on the city council and completed her term. She ran to fill the remainder of the unexpired term in the special election, but came in third out of a field of nineteen candidates.",

Membre de l’iwi (tribu) Te Ati Haunui-a-Paparangi dans la région de Wanganui, il s'implique dans les années 1850 dans les médiations pour ramener la paix dans cette région affectée par de violents conflits territoriaux inter-tribaux. Dans le même temps il participe à des réunions du mouvement Kingitanga, mais pour y exprimer son opposition au mouvement : le Kingitanga affirme son indépendance vis-à-vis des autorités coloniales, tandis que Mete Paetahi est partisan de la souveraineté britannique en Nouvelle-Zélande. Il s'oppose aussi au soulèvement de la secte Pai Marire dans les années 1860, et se joint aux forces maori pro-britanniques qui le combattent. Il prend part à la bataille de Moutoa le 14 mai 1864. Il fournit au gouvernement colonial d'importantes recommandations tactiques dans le conflit, et participe à la bataille d'Ohoutahi en février 1865, puis à l'expédition militaire des forces gouvernementales dans le Taranaki en janvier et février 1866. En 1868 se tiennent les premières élections pour des sièges réservés aux Maori à la Chambre des représentants. Seul candidat dans la circonscription couvrant l'ouest du pays, Paetahi est déclaré élu. Un mois après son entrée au Parlement en mai, les forces coloniales font à nouveau face à une résistance maori armée : l’iwi Ngati Ruanui, sous son chef Titokowaru, se soulève en réponse à des confiscations de terres. Mete Paetahi, s'exprimant au Parlement, incite le gouvernement à répondre avec fermeté, soulignant les exactions commises par les rebelles. La même année, il succède au statut de chef de plus haut rang des tribus du sud du Wanganui. Il perd son siège de député aux élections de 1871. Il ne participe dès lors plus à la vie politique coloniale, mais prend part dans les années 1870 à des réunions inter-tribales maori pour discuter de la représentation politique des Maori, et de l'attitude à adopter sur la question des terres. Il est généralement favorable à l'idée de vendre des terres aux colons, tant que les tribus en conservent suffisamment pour vivre. Il se consacre par ailleurs à l'élevage de moutons qu'il acquiert en 1877. Il meurt à l'âge d'environ 70 ans, et les autorités coloniales l'honorent de funérailles militaires, en reconnaissance de ses services durant les Guerres maories.",

While in the State Assembly, he and fellow Republican representative and future governor Scott Walker were involved in the \"Wisconsin witch hunt\" in 2001–02, in which they attempted to terminate the employment of state employee Jamyl Witch because of her beliefs as a Wiccan. Walker claimed that Witch's hiring as a prison chaplain raised \"both personal and political concerns\" because she \"practice[d] a religion that actually offends people of many other faiths\". Huebsch likewise said that \"Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus,\" proposing to delete the state appropriation which funded Witch's position, although in the past he had repeatedly advocated increasing state funding for prison chaplains. Walker and Huebsch were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating Witch's employment. Huebsch resigned from the Assembly after Walker, now Governor-elect, appointed Huebsch as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration on December 30, 2010. In a special election on May 3, 2011, the District 94 Assembly seat he had held for eight terms went to Democrat Steve Doyle. In early 2015 Huebsch was moved to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. His position as Secretary of Administration is now held by Scott Neitzel.

  "text" : "Mary Fragedakis (born April 22, 1971) is a Canadian politician, who was elected to Toronto City Council in the 2010 city council election to succeed Case Ootes in Ward 29. Prior to her election, Fragedakis was involved for the previous nine years with Open Dialogue, a conference and seminar organizing company. She is also one of the founders of the Broadview Community Youth Group. Fragedakis graduated from the University of Toronto in 1996 with a Master of Arts in political science. According to the Toronto Sun, Fragedakis \"doesn't shy away from the title of being the NDP candidate in the ward.\" The Sun also reported that she sees eye-to-eye with Mayor Rob Ford on several of his campaign pledges including cutting the personal vehicle tax and the land transfer tax. She has since indicated via her Twitter account that this was not accurate, and she does not agree with those positions. Fragedakis was critical of the KPMG report recommending cuts to services and programs without studying the implications of the proposed cuts.",

In the late 1970s, its plan to march in the predominantly Jewish suburb of Skokie, Illinois was challenged, but the ACLU defended its freedom of speech and assembly in a case that reached the United States Supreme Court. The court in National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie (1979), a major First Amendment decision, ruled that the party had a right to march and to display a swastika, despite local opposition. After Collin was convicted and sentenced in 1979 for child molestation, he lost his position in the party. After being released early on parole from prison, Collin created a new career as a writer, publishing numerous books under the pen name Frank Joseph. He wrote New Age and \"hyperdiffusionist\" works supporting the hypothesis that Old World peoples had migrated to North America in ancient times and created its complex indigenous societies. This thesis is rejected by mainstream scholars.",

He was elected a Conservative MLA in 1925 representing Cape Breton Centre and his support from miners helped ensure the Conservative Party's victory in that election. Harrington became Minister of Labour in the government of Edgar N. Rhodes and became Premier of Nova Scotia when Rhodes left provincial politics to ender the federal cabinet in 1930. During Harrington's term he was able to end ongoing labour disturbance among miners in Cape Breton which had afflicted the previous two premiers. He improved the provincial department of mining, fought for the coal and steel industries in Ottawa, and passed legislation calling for a national policy on coal and steel. However, his government was unable to combat the Great Depression and was defeated by the Liberals in the 1933 election. Harrington remained in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly until 1937. His government was the last Conservative government until Robert Stanfield was able to take power in 1956.",

In sein Vaterland zurückgekehrt, wurde er 1782 in der Garde des Erbstatthalters Wilhelm V. angestellt, studierte aber später in Leiden Rechtswissenschaften, stand 1787 während der Unruhen auf oranischer Seite und wurde nach Unterdrückung derselben Pensionär (Stadtschreiber) von Rotterdam, von welchem Posten er nach der Eroberung Hollands durch die Franzosen 1795 zurücktrat, um in Amsterdam ein Kaufmannsgeschäft zu übernehmen. Durch seinen fehlgeschlagenen Plan, eine Kolonie für die Anhänger des Hauses Oranien am Kap der Guten Hoffnung zu gründen, büßte er den größten Teil seines Vermögens ein; dagegen trug er 1813 wesentlich zur Befreiung Hollands vom französischen Okkupation bei, indem er, als die Verbündeten siegreich vordrangen, die Anhänger des Prinzen von Oranien in Den Haag vereinigte. Als Präsident der Kommission, welche mit der Entwerfung der neuen Verfassungsurkunde beauftragt war, übte er einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die übrigen Kommissionsmitglieder aus, so dass er der Haupturheber des niederländischen Staatsgrundgesetzes war. Darauf erhielt er das Departement der auswärtigen Angelegenheiten, wurde Vizepräsident des Staatsrats und 1815 Graf, nahm aber schon 1816 wegen Kränklichkeit seine Entlassung. Als Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Generalstaaten, in die er 1815 gewählt worden war, gehörte er zur Opposition gegen den Minister van Maanen. Auf seinen Platz in der Ersten Kammer verzichtete er, weil die Verhandlungen derselben nicht öffentlich waren. Er war vom 20. September 1815 bis 22. Mai 1819 Staatsminister der Niederlande, wurde dann aber wegen Kritik an der Finanzpolitik Wilhelm I. der Niederlande dieses Titels enthoben. Er ist einer von nur sechs niederländischen Staatsministern bei denen das der Fall war. Er starb am 5. August 1834 im Haag. Er schrieb: \"Über den Handel nach Indien\" (1801, 2 Bde.), \"Memoiren über den Handel nach Java\" (1804), \"Beiträge zur Staatshaushaltung des Königreichs der Niederlande\" (Delft 1818-29, 10 Bde.; 2.

While in private law practice from 1982 to 1995, Sorenson also served as a member of the Board of Education at Lane Community College in Eugene Oregon. During his tenure at Lane Community College, Sorenson advocated strongly for dislocated workers' retraining programs and for childcare for staff and students. In 1993, Sorenson was appointed to the Oregon State Senate, and was elected to a full Senate term in 1994. He was elected Assistant Minority Leader during the 1995 session. Because Oregon term limits at that time prevented Sorenson from running for reelection as a State Senator, he ran for County Commissioner in 1996 and was elected to his first term. He ran successfully for reelection as a County Commissioner in 2000, 2004 and 2008; in 2008 he ran unopposed. In 2009 he was elected by the four other commissioners as Chair of the Board of Commissioners, a position he has held before. Sorenson has always run on a \"pro-environment, pro-education, pro-senior, pro-regular taxpayer, pro-child, pro-civil rights, pro-civil liberties, and pro-people\" platform. In January 2005, Sorenson announced he would challenge incumbent Governor Ted Kulongoski, also a Democrat. Sorenson was defeated in the May 2006 Democratic primary for Governor, receiving 16.27% of the vote. In July 2007 Pete Sorenson and Kim Leval were married. Kim is the Executive Director for the Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticides.

His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands.

In 2003 Wilkie resigned from his position in Australia's Office of National Assessments intelligence agency in the lead up to the Iraq War, because he said he feared the humanitarian consequences of invasion such as Saddam using his Weapons of Mass Destruction, or assisting terrorists. Following his resignation he said: Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.\" He opposed Australia's contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government and ran for Parliament against John Howard as a Green's Candidate in 2004. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a \"lie\". Since 2003 he has been active in Australian politics. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences. Wilkie finished first on the primary vote at the 2013 federal election and increased his margin.",

  "text" : "Alexander Turk (March 5, 1906 – January 1, 1988) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1958. Born in Larne, Northern Ireland, the son of Nathaniel Turk and Mary O'Lynn, Turk came to Canada with his family in 1910, and was educated at Lord Selkirk School. In 1931, he married Annie Owens. He was a wrestling promoter and president of the Giants Baseball Club, and was known in politics as a charismatic showman. Some credit him with introducing modern professional wrestling to Manitoba in 1946 with his company, the NWA-affiliated Alex Turk Promotions. In later years, he would promote Verne Gagne, Pat O'Connor, Bruno Sammartino, Haystacks Calhoun, Lou Thesz and others in the region. He was eventually pushed out of business by competition from the American Wrestling Association. Turk's election to the Manitoba legislature was somewhat unexpected. In the 1953 election, he ran as a candidate of the Liberal-Progressive Party in Winnipeg North, a constituency dominated by the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the communist Labour Progressive Party. He finished seventh out of eleven candidates on the multi-member constituency's first count, behind two other Liberal-Progressive candidates. He did well on transfers, however, and defeated fellow Liberal-Progressive J.M. Kozoriz for the final position. In the legislature, he served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government. Turk was on the left-wing of the Liberal-Progressive Party. In 1954, he was the only member of the government caucus to support a CCF bill calling for comprehensive health insurance. The following year, he was the only Liberal-Progressive MLA to endorse a bill calling for progressive prison reforms. Winnipeg's multi-member constituencies were eliminated in the 1958 election, and Turk lost to Steve Peters of the CCF by 856 votes in the newly created riding of Elmwood. He ran again in the 1959 election, but finished third. After leaving provincial politics, Turk was elected to the Winnipeg City Council. Though a member of the conservative Civic Election Committee, he again showed himself to be a progressive representative on issues relating to workers, pensioners and the handicapped, and often voted with the CCF group. In 1964, he lost his seat on council to another CEC candidate.",

When Lewis retired in June 1912 Solomon became premier, attorney-general and minister of education, but he had a bare majority of one and it required much tact and finesse to keep the ministry going until April 1914. Attention was given to education and considerable additions were made to the number of state and high schools. Never a robust man, Solomon felt the strain of office – his health broke down, and he died at Hobart aged 38 on 5 October 1914. He was survived by his wife and two sons.

In 1873, Fountain moved from El Paso to Mesilla with his wife Mariana Pérez Fountain and their five children. He served the Union Army in California and Arizona during the American Civil War and later as a militia officer defending against raiding Apaches. Later, however, he developed a long and supportive history with several tribes, many Mescaleros calling him a friend. In Mesilla, he worked as assistant district attorney and probate judge as well as a newspaper editor, founding, in 1877, the Mesilla Valley Independent and the Spanish edition El Independiente del Valle de la Mesilla. He also founded the Mesilla Dramatic Society and the Mesilla Valley Opera House, now The Fountain Theater, both originally operated by his family. Following a purge of corruption among cattle rustlers, Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry disappeared near White Sands, New Mexico, where his wagon, stains of blood, and evidence of an ambush were left. Suspicion centered on two rival landowners, Oliver M. Lee and Albert B. Fall. The bodies were never discovered.",

  "text" : "Adrian Pracoń (ur. 8 grudnia 1989 w Skien w Norwegii) – były norweski polityk polskiego pochodzenia, działacz LGBT. Jedna z ofiar Andersa Behringa Breivika, która przeżyła zraniona w zamachu terrorystycznym w dniu 22 lipca 2011 r. na norweskiej wyspie Utøya. Ostatnia osoba, do której Breivik strzelił. Pracoń był uczestnikiem letniego obozu zorganizowanego dla młodzieżówki norweskiej Partii Pracy (AUF). W dniu 15 listopada 2011 r. Pracoń uczestniczył w procesie sądowym przeciw Breivikowi. Następnego dnia wdał się w bójkę, w której dotkliwie pobił starszych od siebie kobietę i mężczyznę. To zdarzenie było szeroko komentowane w norweskich mediach ze względu na sprawcę, ponieważ Pracoń jest w Norwegii jedną z najbardziej rozpoznawalnych ofiar Breivika. Pracoń za swój czyn został skazany w dniu 16 sierpnia 2012 r. prawomocnym wyrokiem na 180 godzin prac społecznych oraz karę pieniężną w wysokości 10.000 NOK na rzecz pobitej kobiety. Pracoń opisał swoje przeżycia podczas zamachu w książce pt.: \"Hjertet mot steinen\" (nor.: Serce o kamień). Na wniosek rodziny jednej ze śmiertelnych ofiar tego zamachu pierwszy nakład tej książki został nakazem sądowym wycofany z księgarń w dniu 20 kwietnia 2012 r. Wnioskodawcy wycofania książki ze sprzedaży oświadczyli, że Pracoń nie uzyskał zgody rodziny na wymienienie w swojej książce 23 razy nazwiska zabitego chłopca w zestawieniu z opisem zamachu na wyspie Utøya. Pracoń był zmuszony przygotować i ponownie wydać poprawioną wersję swej książki dla czytelników norweskich. Jako późny efekt przeżyć podczas zamachu, doznał załamania nerwowego i był leczony psychiatrycznie zimą 2013 roku. Innym następstwem zdarzenia na wyspie Utøya jest rezygnacja Praconia z działalności politycznej i decyzja o podjęciu studiów dziennikarskich. Jest działaczem LLH, norweskiej organizacji LGBT (ang.: Norwegian National Association for Lesbian and Gay Liberation).",

Due to his vast experience as a certified real estate broker and member of the Board of Directors of the Montreal Real Estate Board for 17 years, he was entrusted with the responsibility of a number of matters relating to urban development. At the same time, Mr. Farinacci also held various other positions over those years, including chairman of the Commission de l'aménagement du territoire et du développement économique (land use planning and economic development committee), member of the Comité de toponymie (toponymy committee) and, for 16 years, was a member of LaSalle's Comité consultatif d'urbanisme (urban planning advisory committee), where he in fact served as that committee's first chairman. Mr. Farinacci also very significantly contributed to LaSalle's economic growth. He was a founding member of the Corporation de développement économique de LaSalle (CDEL) in 1984 and then served as CDEL's chairman for a number of years. He was also one of the founders of the Comité de sécurité industrielle (committee on safety in the workplace). Recalling that the Mayor had given him the mandate \"to develop a structure designed to arouse interest in order to promote and attract investments to LaSalle\", Alvaro Farinacci mentioned how very proud he was of his contribution to the birth of CDEL, \"which was one of the biggest successes in the history of LaSalle\".From 2001 to 2013, he was a Council member of the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, which greatly benefited from his real estate experience and expertise, entrusting him with the position of vice-chairman of the Commission permanente du logement social (standing committee on social housing). At the present time, he is a member of Ville de Montréal's Commission sur le développement économique et urbain et l'habitation (committee on economic and urban development and housing).A certified real estate agent for 40 years, a businessman actively involved in his community, Alvaro Farinacci has also played a major role in LaSalle's community and cultural life, for instance, as a member of the Board of Directors of Centre culturel Henri-Lemieux and the Fondation de l'Hôpital LaSalle, where he was a Board member and vice-chairman for 25 years.",
