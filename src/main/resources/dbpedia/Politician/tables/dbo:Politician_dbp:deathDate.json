He then established himself in the western part of Norwalk, at a house he built on the eastern side of the Five Mile River, north of the Old Post Road and nearly two miles from the Long Island Sound at a place called Reed's Farms. His name is found among the records of the town of Norwalk in 1687. John Read was admitted to the bar in 1708 in Norwalk, Connecticut. His house was used for a meeting place for some years. His wife died and he married again to the Widow Scofield from Stamford. He died in Norwalk, in the ninety-eighth year of his age, in 1730, and was interred in a tomb on his own farm.",

In this role he was on a committee to draft instructions to Providence citizens in regards to protesting the egregious Stamp Act passed by the British parliament to tax the American colonists. During the lead up to the American Revolutionary War Cole was privy to the plan and execution of the burning of the British revenue schooner Gaspee that ran aground near Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. He was deeply complicit with Stephen Hopkins and other leading Providence citizens in withholding evidence from the British commission of inquiry that was established to find the instigators of the Gaspee Affair. After a year of collecting testimonies, the court dissolved, having failed to indict a single person. In 1775 Cole became the Advocate General of Rhode Island's Vice Admiralty Court, but died of smallpox just two years later.",

Zhong Hui rose to prominence in the 250s when he became a close aide to Sima Zhao, the regent and de facto ruler of Wei. He advised Sima Zhao on how to deal with the Third Rebellion in Shouchun from 257–258 and was highly regarded by the latter. With Sima Zhao's help, Zhong Hui steadily moved up the ranks and became one of the key figures in the Wei government. In 263, the Wei imperial court ordered Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead separate armies to attack and conquer Wei's rival state, Shu Han. During and after the campaign against Shu, Zhong Hui framed Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu for treason and cowardice respectively, thereby eliminating them and putting himself in full control of all the Wei forces in Shu by the time Shu surrendered to Wei. In 264, with backing from Jiang Wei, a former Shu general, Zhong Hui started a rebellion against Sima Zhao. However, the revolt failed when Zhong Hui's plan to purge several Wei officers – because he was worried that they would not support him – was leaked out. The officers escaped from custody, regrouped with their men, mutinied against Zhong Hui, and killed him and Jiang Wei.",

Claiborne became a wealthy planter, a trader, and a major figure in the politics of the colonies. He was a central figure in the disputes between the colonists of Virginia and the later settling of Maryland, partly because of his earlier trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay, which provoked the first naval military battles in North American waters. Claiborne repeatedly attempted and failed to regain Kent Island from the Maryland Calverts, sometimes by force of arms, after its inclusion in the lands that were granted by a 1632 Royal Charter to the Calvert family (to Sir George Calvert, first Baron and Lord Baltimore, (1579-1632), by the reigning King of England, Charles I, (1600–1649, reigned 1625 to execution, 1649), thus becoming Maryland territory. A Puritan, William Claiborne, sided with Parliament, during the English Civil War, of 1642–1651 and was appointed to a commission charged with subduing and managing the, British colonies of, the Province of Virginia and Province of Maryland. He played a role in the submission of Virginia to parliamentary rule in this period. Following the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, he retired from involvement in the politics of the Virginia colony. He died around 1677 at his plantation, \"Romancoke\", on Virginia's Pamunkey River. According to historian Robert Brenner, \"William Claiborne may have been the most consistently influential politician in Virginia throughout the whole of the pre-Restoration period\".",

Damuah war Gründer der Afrikania Mission, einer religiösen nationalen Bewegung mit starken politischen Prinzipien und Zielen. Die Gründung der Afrikania Mission soll im Dezember 1982 stattgefunden haben. Andere Quellen nennen den katholischen Priester Osofo Okomfo Damuah als Gründer der Afrikania Mission im Jahr 1985.

Cincinnatus was regarded by the Romans, especially the aristocratic patrician class, as one of the heroes of early Rome and as a model of Roman virtue and simplicity. He was a persistent opponent of the plebeians. When his son, Caeso Quinctius, was convicted and condemned to death, Cincinnatus was forced to live in humble circumstances, working on his own small farm, until an invasion caused him to be called to serve Rome as dictator, an office which he resigned two weeks later, after completing his task of defeating the rival tribes of the Aequians, Sabines, and Volscians. His immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of the crisis has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, civic virtue, lack of personal ambition, and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, many of which are named in his honor.",

  "text" : "Leo Landreville (February 23, 1910 – 1996) was a Canadian politician and lawyer, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario in 1955 and 1956  before being appointed to the Supreme Court of Ontario as a judge. He later became the first Ontario Supreme Court justice ever to be removed from the bench, after being implicated in the Northern Ontario Natural Gas scandal. Landreville, a native of Ottawa, practiced law in Sudbury in the 1940s and 1950s before becoming the city's mayor. During his mayoral term, he was offered an option on 10,000 shares of stock in Northern Ontario Natural Gas, a company run by Ralph K. Farris that was seeking a municipal agreement on the construction of a natural gas pipeline through Northern Ontario. When the NONG contract was approved by city council, Farris purchased the shares at the original price offered to Landreville, sold 2,500 shares to reimburse the company, and delivered the 7,500 remaining shares to Landreville at no cost. Following his appointment to the Supreme Court, Landreville sold the shares for a profit of $117,000. After an Ontario Securities Commission investigation into NONG's stock distributions, it was ultimately revealed that many of Northern Ontario's mayors, as well as some members of Premier Leslie Frost's cabinet, had received low-cost shares. After a second investigation, Landreville was charged with municipal corruption and conspiracy, and was acquitted as there was no evidence that he had exerted any influence on Sudbury's city council to approve the NONG contract. In response, however, the Law Society of Upper Canada held a secret hearing in which it determined that despite the acquittal, Landreville's conduct had fallen below the \"standards of probity\" demanded of a judge, and called for his resignation. In 1966, Prime Minister Lester Pearson appointed a Royal Commission, chaired by Ivan Rand, to investigate the case. Controversially, the Law Society report was admitted into the proceedings, but the original judgement acquitting Landreville of misconduct was not. Landreville was also never given an opportunity, as required under law, to respond to the royal commission's report. Landreville initially refused to resign from the bench, leading Pearson's government to announce, on June 6, 1967, an unusual joint address of the House of Commons and the Senate to have him removed from the bench. He was then convinced to resign voluntarily with the promise of a partial pension. Pierre Trudeau, then Justice Minister, later wrote to advise Landreville that the federal cabinet had decided not to offer Landreville the pension, although subsequent Access to Information requests revealed that the cabinet had made no such decision. Landreville waged a ten-year legal battle to have the pension offer honoured, and was finally offered $250,000. Landreville subsequently returned to practicing law.",

He was the first to write history in Latin. He came of an ancient Plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome and began to follow the cursus honorum: he was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204 BC), aedile (199 BC), praetor (198 BC), junior consul (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and censor (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to preserve Rome's ancestral customs and combat \"degenerate\" Hellenistic influences. His epithet \"Elder\" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.",

  "text" : "Charles-Melchior Arthus, Marquis de Bonchamps (10 May 1760 – 18 October 1793) was a French politician and leader of the Vendéan insurrection of Royalists against the Republic during the French Revolution. Born at Juvardeil, Anjou, he gained his first military experience in the American War of Independence, and on his return to France was made a captain of grenadiers in the French royal army. He was a staunch defender of the French monarchy, and at the outbreak of the Revolution, resigned his command and retired to his château at Saint-Florent-le-Vieil. Shortly before the revolution broke out, Bonchamps feared for his king and country and requested to be reinstated. In the spring of 1793 he was chosen leader by the insurgents of the Vendée, and his directives were able to secure a large amount of supplies and weapons that would greatly aid the counterrevolution. He was present at the taking of Bressuire, Thouars, and of Fontenay-le-Comte - where he was wounded but recovered. Dissensions among their leaders weakened the insurgents, and at the bloody battle of Cholet (October 1793) the Vendéans sustained a severe defeat and Bonchamps was mortally wounded. He died the next day. His last act was the pardoning of five thousand Republican prisoners, whom his troops had sworn to kill in revenge for his death. Bonchamps was one of the best tactical leaders of the Vendéans and his death was an important victory for the republican forces. He was admired by the Christian monarchists and revolutionaries alike. A statue of him by Pierre Jean David stands in the church of Saint-Florent-le-Vieil.",

Il assiége les forts ennemis positionnés dans les montagnes Qu'et repousse Jiang Wei à la colline de la Tête de Bœuf, remportant ainsi une splendide victoire. Durant la seconde campagne militaire de Jiang Wei contre les Wei, il réussit à piéger les Qiang, alors allié des Shu, et parvient ainsi a défaire l’invasion.

  "text" : "Ahmet Cem Ersever (Erzurum, 1950 - Ankara, 4 november 1993) was een gepensioneerde Turkse majoor, die later de JİTEM heeft opgericht, waarvan het bestaan jarenlang door de Turkse staat werd ontkend. Ersever, die zijn militaire loopbaan had afgerond, probeerde zo veel mogelijk informatie te krijgen over hoe de Koerdische Arbeiders partij (PKK) te werk ging door te infiltreren. Hij was zelf betrokken bij vuurgevechten tegen de PKK. Ersever kreeg in die tijd ook veel inlichtingen van de Hizbullahî Kurdî (niet te verwarren met de Hezbollah uit Libanon), die door de staat indirect werd opgericht als tegenhanger van de PKK. Nadat de Turkse Generaal Eşref Bitlis in maart 1993 om het leven kwam door een vliegtuigongeluk, heeft Ersever opmerkelijke uitspraken gedaan over de toestand in het oosten van Turkije. Een paar maanden daarna werd zijn levenloze lichaam teruggevonden rond een depot in Elmadağ.",

  "text" : "U Lwin (Burmese: ဦးလွင်; 22 October 1924 – 6 December 2011) was a career army officer (ranked Colonel) in the Burmese Army and a National League for Democracy politician, who won a parliamentary seat in the Burmese general election, 1990, after contesting the Thongwa constituency. U Lwin was born in Rangoon's Pazundaung Township to parents Ba Tha and Thein. He first joined the Burma Independence Army in 1942 and served during World War II and in anti-rebel and anti-Kuomintang campaigns in the 1940s to 1950s, after Burma declared its independence. After martial law was declared in 1962, he served various roles including Minister of Finance, deputy prime minister and member of the Revolutionary Council under the Burma Socialist Programme Party, until his resignation in 1980. U Lwin is Secretary of the NLD and is a former party Treasurer. He was among the NLD representatives who boycotted the National Convention in December 1995 and is a former BSPP Deputy Prime Minister and member of the BSPP State Council.He completed high school in Rangoon before World War II and served in the Burma Independence Army (BIA), Burma Defence Army (BDA) and with the Patriotic Burmese Force (PBF) from 1942-1945. He completed BDA officer training at the Japanese Royal Military Academy and from 1952-1954 studied at the British Royal Military Academy. He was also the Military Attaché to the USA. U Lwin was put under de facto house arrest on 22 September 2000 and released on 1 December 2000.[ Member of CRPP, Chairperson of Committee for Health and Social Affairs ] U Lwin received 18,189 valid votes or 68 % in the 1990 elections.{ The only original member of the executive committee, who was left after 1990 to help U Aung Shwe in his struggle to keep the NLD intact through the years that threatened its viability as a political party, was U Lwin, the treasurer. U Lwin had joined the Burmese Independence Army as an 18-year-old boy at the outbreak of the war. In August 1943 he was among a batch of Burmese cadets chosen to go to Japan for training at the Rikugun Shikan Gakko (army academy). By the time the young Burmese officers had completed their training in April 1945, the anti-fascist resistance movement had started and U Lwin and his fellow graduates of the military academy remained in Hakone until October 1945, making charcoal which they sold to buy food. U Lwin continued with his career in the army after independence and was sent on training courses to England and West Germany. In 1959 he was sent to Washington as military attache. On his return from the United States he spent some years as deputy commander of Central Command, then commander of South Eastern Command before he was asked to come back to Rangoon to become a deputy minister. As the military government that assumed power in 1962 took on a civilian garb under the Burmese Socialist Programme Party, U Lwin served successively as minister of finance, deputy prime minister and a member of the state council. It was as a member of the state council that he resigned in 1980. U Lwin joined the NLD in 1988 and was appointed treasurer because of his experience in finances and his unquestioned integrity. In 1992, when the NLD was forced to reorganize its executive committee, U Lwin took on the post of secretary, while U Aung Shwe became chairman. He died of natural causes at his home in Yangon's Bahan Township on 7 December 2011. He was subsequently cremated at the Yayway Cemetery.",

The group headed west through the wilderness, and after a month stopped in an area now occupied by the city of Hartford, Connecticut. Within the year, the group started a collective government to fight the Pequot War. By the next year, they had adopted what is now generally considered the first written constitution in Western history, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The group eventually signed a treaty with the Indians for a tract of land and settled down. The present-day state capitol building in Hartford sits on the original Risley land grant.

He settled in Charles City County, Virginia in early 1656, though he may have arrived in Virginia earlier. He served on the county court, though he was fined for poor attendance in September 1659. He also did not serve as a burgess in that year's assembly, though he did the years before and after. The House of Burgesses called by Sir William Berkeley in 1661 continued without dissolving until 1676, meeting in seventeen sessions during that period. At the second session in 1662, Wynne was elected as Speaker to replace Henry Soane, who had died during the recess. Under Wynne's leadership, the House took an active role in business previously left to the Governor and Council, creating a standing committee to advise the Governor between sessions.

Samoa was easily occupied on 29 August 1914 and Logan became its Military Administrator; he remained in this capacity for the duration of the war. Although he was decorated for his services, his administration of Samoa was later criticised, particularly in relation to the handling of the influenza outbreak of November 1918, which led to 7,500 deaths. Logan retired from military service in 1919 and settled in Devon, England, where he died in 1935.",

Tanner Creek, which flowed by the site in the mid-19th century, was named after the tannery. Lownsdale served as a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. Lownsdale purchased the land that would become downtown Portland on September 22, 1848. He resurveyed Portland, keeping the small blocks (200 feet per side, 64 feet streets), and adding the contiguous park blocks. He became involved in a land dispute involving the authority of the laws from the Provisional Government with Josiah Lamberson Parrish. Lownsdale would defend the matter in court in a case that would make its way through the Oregon Supreme Court and to the United States Supreme Court in Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858). Lownsdale is buried in the Salem Pioneer Cemetery.",

Sutton was elected in the newly created riding of York--Scarborough which comprised all of the then Borough of Scarborough, Ontario. The population of the borough increased so much, between 1955 and 1963, that it was further subdivided in four ridings for the 1967 provincial general election, making Sutton the only MPP to ever represent the riding. He served as a backbench member of a succession of PC majority governments led by Premiers Leslie Frost and then John Robarts. Despite his lengthy time in office, Lewis did not serve in Cabinet, but he was a member of up to ten Standing Committees of the Legislative Assembly, simultaneously, with a particular interest in committees dealing with municipal law, agriculture, education and conservation. Sutton was married, in 1943, to Margherita May Hodgson (1900 - 1985), who, in turn, was related to three other Members of Provincial Parliament, Ronald Glen Hodgson, Louis Hodgson and Chris Hodgson.",

He was born on a farm in Hebron, Nebraska, the son of Frank Herman Kemper and Louisa Haulker. In 1906, Kemper found work with a survey crew working on the railway west of Edmonton, Alberta. He returned home later that year but, in the summer of 1907, he traveled north again and worked on a farm near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Later in 1907, he settled on a homestead south of Gull Lake. Kemper returned to Nebraska and married Mina Burwell in 1911. The couple returned to Saskatchewan later that same year. After working on a farm near Moose Jaw, they were able to purchase land not far from his original homestead. Kemper served on the rural municipal district council for Arlington. He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the Saskatchewan general election, 1934, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932. In 1935, it changed its name and officially became the Saskatchewan section of the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF. During the eighth provincial election on June 19, 1934, the FLG had five elected members come to office, including Kemper. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in Gull Lake in 1938 and in the Maple Creek federal riding in 1940. In 1953, Kemper sold his farm and retired to the town of Shaunavon. He died in a car accident near Tompkins while travelling to a CCF rally.",

  "text" : "Osbeorn (died c. 1054), given the nickname Bulax, was the son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria (died 1055). He is one of two known sons — probably the older — of Siward. While it is normally assumed he was the son of Siward's Bamburgh wife Ælfflæd, it has been suggested by William Kapelle that Osbeorn's mother was not Ælfflæd. The nickname \"Bulax\" probably represents the Old Norse term for \"Poleaxe\". According to the most reliable sources, he died at the Battle of the Seven Sleepers, fought somewhere in Scotland between Siward and Mac Bethad mac Findlaích, King of the Scots, in 1054. Under this year, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recension D, related that: \"At this time earl Siward went with a great army into Scotland, with both fleet and a land-force; and fought against the Scots, and put to flight the king Mac Bethad, and slew all that were best in the land, and brought thence much war-spoil, such as no man obtained before;   And there were slain his son Osbeorn, and his sister's son Siward, and some of his housecarls, and also of the king's, on the day of the Seven Sleepers (July 27).\"   This battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the Firth of Forth, and is known variously as the \"Battle of the Seven Sleepers\" or the \"Battle of Dunsinane\". The location Dunsinane is not accepted as historical by modern historians, resting as it does on later medieval accounts. The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle being the early 15th-century account by Andrew of Wyntoun. In recension C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the names of the slain are omitted, an omission repeated by the Chronicle of John of Worcester. Henry of Huntingdon related that Osbeorn had been sent to Scotland ahead of Siward:\"[Siward] sent his son to acquire Scotland. And when they reported to his father that he had been slain in battle, [Siward] said, 'Did he receive the mortal wound in front of his body, or behind?' The messengers said. 'In front'. And he replied: 'I rejoice wholly, for I would deem myself or my son worthy of no meaner death'. Siward therefore marched into Scotland and conquered the king battle ... \" Another legendary account, in the Vita et Passio Waldevi, a hagiography of Osbeorn's brother Waltheof, claimed that Osbeorn, called \"Osbert Bulax\", was killed by Northumbrians while his father was absent in Scotland. The accounts in Henry of Huntingdon and the Vita et Passio Waldevi are thought to be derived from a saga devoted to the life of Earl Siward. Geoffrey Gaimar's account related activity in 1053, an agreement made between Siward and Mac Bethad, but a death of Osbeorn is not mentioned. Osbeorn's death left Siward's legacy in danger. When he died the following year, his only son Waltheof was underage and thus did not succeed immediately to the whole territory ruled by Siward, Northumbria going instead to Tostig Godwinson.",

He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro. In Plutarch's Parallel Lives Sulla is paired with the Spartan general and strategist Lysander. Sulla's dictatorship came during a high point in the struggle between optimates and populares, the former seeking to maintain the Senate's oligarchy, and the latter espousing populism. In a dispute over the eastern army command (initially awarded to Sulla by the Senate but reneged at Gaius Marius's intrigues) Sulla unconstitutionally marched his armies into Rome and defeated Marius in battle. After his second march on Rome, he revived the office of dictator which had been inactive since the Second Punic War over a century before, and used his powers to enact a series of reforms to the Roman Constitution, meant to restore the primacy of the Senate and limit tribune power. Sulla's ascension was also marked by political purges in proscriptions. After seeking election to and holding a second consulship, he retired to private life and died shortly after. Sulla's decision to seize power – ironically enabled by his rival's military reforms that bound the army's loyalty with the general rather than to Rome – permanently destabilized the Roman power structure. Later leaders like Julius Caesar would follow his precedent in attaining political power through force.",

  "text" : "Stephen J. McCormick (1828–1891) was a prominent printer and publisher in Oregon, United States, who served as mayor of Portland, Oregon, from 1859–1860. He was originally from Dublin, Ireland. He worked as a newspaper reporter in New York. He came to Portland with his wife in 1851. In Oregon, McCormick worked as a printer and publisher. In 1852, he opened a book shop in Portland, the Franklin Book Store. He began publishing a semi-weekly newspaper, The Portland Commercial, on March 24, 1853, but it was discontinued after a short life. He was elected as a Multnomah County delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention, held in 1857. He also served on the county commission and school board. He became a prominent publisher in Oregon, and his publications included the Oregon Almanac (originally known as McCormick's Almanac), Oregon Monthly Magazine, a city directory for Portland, and Abigail Scott Duniway's Captain Gray's Company (1859). In 1857, he was elected chief of the Portland Fire Department (established in 1854), serving for a brief period. He was elected mayor of Portland in April 1859, for a one-year term. During and after his term as mayor, he continued working in his main occupation, publishing. On May 13, 1859, he established another Portland newspaper, the Portland Daily Advertiser, which was only the second daily newspaper in the Pacific Northwest (the first being the Portland Daily News, which began publication less than four weeks before McCormick's Advertiser). It ceased publication – a suspension that became permanent – in October 1862. McCormick sold the paper before the start of the Civil War in 1861, the same year that The Oregonian became a daily paper. The Advertiser was pro-slavery and, according to a 1911 account by Henry Pittock, it took a pro-secession stance after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President in March 1861, causing the paper to lose influence in Portland, where the majority of residents were pro-Union. It ceased publication the following year. McCormick subsequently moved to San Francisco, California, where he became editor of the Catholic Monitor newspaper. In 1889, he wrote the book, The Pope and Ireland. He died in San Francisco in 1891.",

His family were well known for their piety, learning and influence throughout Kurdistan for years before him. After being educated at the Religious School of Amadiya, He followed his ancestors in following the Naqshbandi Sufi order. During his life he granted more than hundred religious scientific licenses for scholars from different parts of Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East in general, and sponsored the daily living and study costs of his students and followers. He also contributed to establishing many schools and mosques in Bamarni, Amadiya and in many different villages. The Sheikh was also accredited for opening the first school in the Bahdinan region and obliged all children to attend school. The idea of opening a school was not favored by the then ruling government, and decided they would not pay the salaries of the teachers. This caused the Sheikh to pay the teachers salaries with his own money.",

He was, perhaps, the son of Captain William Smith, a magistrate in Weymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony. He moved to Norwalk as a young man, and he listed among its earliest settlers. His father-in-law, Matthew Marvin, Sr. gave Smith half of his home lot and orchard. In 1672, he owned \"a parcel of land in Indian Field,\" not far from the Norwalk-Westport boundary. He was named a freeman in 1674. In 1679, he served as town treasurer. He was on a committee, along with Matthew Marvin, Sr., and John Bowton to obtain a minister for the settlement, which appointed Reverend Thomas Hanford. He served as a deputy of the Connecticut General Court in 1691. He was a townsman in 1698, 1702, 1706, and 1712. In 1702, he was selectman.

  "text" : "Marcus Licinius Crassus (/ˈkræsəs/; Latin: M·LICINIVS·P·F·P·N·CRASSVS; c. 115 BC – 53 BC) was a Roman general and politician who played a key role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Amassing an enormous fortune during his life, Crassus is considered the wealthiest man in Roman history. Crassus began his public career as a military commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his civil war. Following Sulla's assumption of the dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through real estate speculation. Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus, sharing the Consulship with his rival Pompey the Great. A political and financial patron of Julius Caesar, Crassus joined Caesar and Pompey in the unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate. Together the three men dominated the Roman political system. The alliance would not last indefinitely due to the ambitions, egos, and jealousies of the three men. While Caesar and Crassus were lifelong allies, Crassus and Pompey disliked each other and Pompey grew increasingly envious of Caesar's spectacular successes in the Gallic Wars. The alliance was re-stabilized at the Lucca Conference in 56 BC, after which Crassus and Pompey again served jointly as Consuls. Following his second Consulship, Crassus was appointed as the Governor of Roman Syria. Crassus used Syria as the launchpad for a military campaign against the Parthian Empire, Rome's long-time Eastern enemy. Crassus' campaign was a disastrous failure, resulting in his defeat and death at the Battle of Carrhae. Crassus' death permanently unraveled the alliance between Caesar and Pompey. Within four years of Crassus' death, Caesar would cross the Rubicon and begin a civil war against Pompey and the optimates.",

According to Polybius, Lepidus was 'the handsomest man of his time,' as well as, in the words of Diodorus, being 'gifted with superior intelligence'. Combining these qualities with an impeccable aristocratic birth, political skill and a reputation for bravery, Lepidus soon rose to become one of the leading Romans of his generation.

During his term he became embroiled in a controversy when James Edwin Robertson was declared ineligible for election to the Canadian House of Commons after winning a seat in the 1882 federal election, on the grounds that he was still a sitting member of Prince Edward Island's legislative assembly, and therefore ineligible to run in the federal election. According to Robertson, in accordance with the process for resigning from the legislature he had submitted his resignation notice to two fellow MLAs, McFadyen and Peter McLaren, but a procedural error in McFadyen and McLaren's handling of the document had left the resignation improperly registered.",

He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce.

En l’an 212, alors que Liu Bei se trouva à l’ouest, dans la province de Yi, Gu Yong proposa d’attaquer la province de Jing afin de recouvrir ces terres longtemps convoités. En raison d'une menace d’invasion de Cao Cao, l’attaque n’eut cependant pas lieu. Souvent consulté avec Zhang Zhao sur les enjeux cruciaux, il conseilla à Sun Quan en l’an 217, de rétablir la paix avec Cao Cao. Une alliance se forgea donc et en l’an 221, lorsque Cao Cao offrit le titre de Roi des Wu à Sun Quan, Gu Yong s’y opposa, prétextant qu’il devrait plutôt se nommer lui-même Commandant en Chef. Toutefois, Sun Quan accepta le titre et Gu Yong fut nommé Préfet des Maîtres des Écrits et devint, en l’an 225, Premier Ministre des Wu avec autorité sur le secrétariat impérial. Plus tard, lorsque l’alliance se brisa, il recommanda Lu Xun pour contrer l’invasion mener par Cao Xiu en l’an 228. D’ailleurs, il fut reconnu pour son objectivité dans ses nominations de même que par son grand sens de la justice tout au long de son mandat. Grandement respecté, il tomba malade, puis mourut en l’an 243. Ses descendants continuèrent à occuper des rangs importants pendant plusieurs générations.",

  "text" : "Cayo Servilio Gémino (en latín, Gaius Servilius Geminus) hijo de un triunviro del mismo nombre, el cual había sido hecho prisionero por los galos boios en el primer año de la segunda guerra púnica (218 a. C.), mientras asentaba colonos en Placencia y Cremona. Se le menciona por primera vez en el año 212 a. C., cuando fue enviado a Etruria para comprar grano para el uso de la guarnición romana en la ciudadela de Tarento, la cual estaba sitiada por Aníbal. Él tuvo éxito en forzar la entrada hacia el puerto, y así suministrar a la guarnición con el grano recolectado. En 210 a. C. fue elegido pontífice en el lugar de T. Otacilio Craso; en el año 209 a. C. fue edil plebeyo; y en 208 a. C. edil curul. En este último año, mientras ocupaba el cargo de edil curul, fue nombrado magister equitum por el dictador T. Manlio Torcuato. Fue pretor en el año 206 a. C., cuando obtuvo Sicilia como provincia, y cónsul en 203 a. C. con Cneo Servilio Cepión. Tito Livio, al hablar de su consulado, así como posteriormente, lo llama C. Servilio Gémino, pero en los Fastos Capitolinos su nombre aparece como C. Servilius C. f. P. Nepos. Por tanto, es posible que su cognomen \"Gémino\" sea un error. C. Servilio obtuvo Etruria como su provincia, y de allí marchó a la Galia Cisalpina, donde liberó a su padre de su cautiverio. Tito Livio menciona que una rogatio fue propuesta al pueblo para liberar a Servilio de las consecuencias (ne C Servilia fraudi esset), de haber actuado en contra de las leyes en haber sido tribuno de la plebe y edil plebeyo, mientras su padre estaba vivo, ya que se había sentado en la silla curul, ignorante de la existencia de su padre. Ningún otro escritor clásico menciona ninguna ley que prohibía tal elección. En 202 a. C., fue nombrado Servilio dictador por el cónsul Marco Servilio Púlex Gémino con el propósito de la celebración de los comicios, siendo la última persona que fue nombrado dictador hasta la usurpación de esta magistratura por Sila. En 201 a. C., fue uno de los decemviri para la distribución de tierras entre los veteranos que habían luchado en África con P. Escipión, y en 183 a. C. fue elegido Pontifex Maximus en el lugar de P. Licinio Craso. Murió en el año 180 a. C..",

Xu Caihou (Chinese: 徐才厚; June 1943 – March 2015) was a general in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China and Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the country's top military council. As Vice-Chairman of the CMC, he was one of the top ranking officers of the People's Liberation Army. He also held a seat on the 25-member Politburo of the Communist Party of China between 2007 and 2012. Born to a working-class family in Liaoning province, Xu spent much of his earlier career in northeastern China. He moved to Beijing in 1990 to become political commissar of the 16th Group Army, later serving as editor of the PLA's flagship newspaper, the PLA Daily. In 1996 Xu became political commissar of the Jinan Military Region. He became Vice-Chairman of the CMC in September 2004. He retired from office in March 2013. Xu was detained and put under investigation on suspicion of bribery in March 2014, in one of the highest profile corruption investigations in PLA history, and was expelled from the Communist Party in June 2014. It was alleged that Xu had traded \"massive bribes\" for the promotion of officers under him during his time as Vice-Chairman of the CMC. Xu was undergoing legal proceedings and facing a court martial but charges were dropped after he died of bladder cancer in March 2015.",

  "text" : "Le lieutenant-colonel Alexandre Banza (né en 1932 et décédé le 12 avril 1969) est un militaire et politicien centrafricain. Né à Carnot (Haute-Sangha), il servit dans l'armée française durant la Guerre d'Indochine avant de rejoindre les forces armées centrafricaines. En tant que commandant de la base militaire de Camp Kassaï en 1965, il aida Jean-Bedel Bokassa à renverser le gouvernement du président David Dacko lors du coup d'État de la Saint-Sylvestre. Bokassa le récompensa par la suite en le nommant ministre d'État et ministre des finances de son nouveau gouvernement. Banza établit rapidement la réputation du nouveau régime en forgeant de bonnes relations diplomatiques avec les pays étrangers, permettant au gouvernement de Bokassa d'asseoir sa légitimé sur le plan international. En 1967, ce dernier et Banza obtinrent même un soutien militaire de la France. Pourtant le président congédia Banza l'année suivante. Il devint alors du jour au lendemain très critique vis-à-vis du gouvernement, allant jusqu'à demander sa démission. Banza décida peu de temps après d'organiser un nouveau coup d'État. Il se confia à plusieurs officiers qu'il espérait rallier à sa cause et qui auraient été susceptibles de le soutenir dans ta tentative. L'un d'eux, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacta Bokassa et l'informa que le coup d'État était prévu pour le 9 avril 1969. Quelques heures seulement avant l'exécution du plan, Banza tomba dans une embuscade menée par Mandaba lui-même et fut directement mené au président Bokassa. Celui-ci le battit presque à mort avant que Mandaba suggère qu'il soit jugé pour décourager d'éventuelles tentatives de déstabilisation du régime. Le 12 avril, Banza fut présenté devant un tribunal militaire qui le condamna à être fusillé en une seule séance. Il fut mené dans un champ où il fut exécuté et enterré anonymement. Le Time et Le Monde ont proposé d'autres versions du déroulement de sa mort. Après l'échec de son coup d'État, sa maîtresse et ses collaborateurs les plus proches furent tous arrêtés et emprisonnés ou envoyés en exil. Après son élimination, Bokassa eut les mains libres pour développer son emprise sur la politique centrafricaine, ce qui le conduisit à se proclamer empereur en 1976.",

  "text" : "Andreas Ziartides (Greek: Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης; 1919–1997) was a Cypriot trade unionist and politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1960 to 1991, being elected as a candidate of the left wing AKEL party. He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) from 1943 to 1986. His contribution to the development of labour relations and labour legislation in Cyprus has been crucial and many consider him the person with the most significant role in shaping the trade union movement on the island. Legislations such as the Social Security Law of Cyprus in 1956 (Πρώτος Νόμος Περί Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων, Νόμος Αρ. 31 του 1956), the introduction of the Cost of Living Allowance, the eight-hour working day and the forty hour working week, legislation on unfair dismissal and the labour disputes tribunals, the shaping of the collective agreements in many sectors of economic activity as well as the tripartite cooperation between trade unions, employers’ organisations and government all bear his mark. He first joined the outlawed Communist Party of Cyprus in 1939 and became a member of left wing AKEL party in 1941 upon its foundation.He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Trade Union Committee, the first coordinating body of trade unions in Cyprus and the precursor of PEO. He was accused along with all the Committee members for sedition and insurrection against the Colonial order and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in 1946. This was a major political trial of the colonial era and his address to the court was a memorable anti-colonial statement. Andreas Ziartides participated as the Cypriot representative in the founding congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) held in 1945 in London. He served on the General Council and the Executive Committee of the WFTU for many years and was its Vice President for a while. In the early nineties he, along with others in the AKEL leadership, disagreed with the line followed by the Party and was dismissed from his leadership position. This led to his and others’ departure from AKEL and the formation of ADESOK, in Greek: ΑΔΗΣΟΚ (Ανανεωτικό Δημοκρατικό Σοσιαλιστικό Κόμμα), a reformist leftist party. ADESOK was later merged with Free Democrats Movement (founded by former President of Cyprus George Vassiliou) and formed a new party named United Democrats. A form of interview/biography of Andreas Ziartides was authored by Panikos Paionides in his book \"Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης: Χωρίς φόβο και πάθος\" Television interviews of Andreas Ziartides were documented by journalist Pavlos Pavlou (Greek: Παύλος Παύλου) in his book Dimosia Katathesi (Greek: Δημόσια Κατάθεση).",
