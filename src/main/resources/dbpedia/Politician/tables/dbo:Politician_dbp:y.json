He earned his prestige by fighting for the New Territories indigenous interests by insert an article in the Hong Kong Basic Law to ensure their privileges remained protected after Hong Kong's handover to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 when he was a member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee. For this, together with his extensive ownership of land and property, he is known as the \"King of the New Territories\" (新界王) or the \"Land Emperor of the New Territories\" (新界土皇帝). Billionaire Lau is politically identified as part of the pro-Beijing camp.

Although the Hong Kong government prior to as well as after the British handover shunned him for his opposition to their policies, Szeto was admired in Hong Kong politics for his strong principles, for eschewing personal gain, and for his rare political acumen. According to commentator Stephen Vines, the Chinese central government appointed Szeto to the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee because they appreciated his political significance, even though they disliked his ideas. Aside from his political career, Szeto was also well known for his Chinese calligraphy skills. He was referred to as \"Uncle Wah\" (華叔) by Hong Kong people.",
