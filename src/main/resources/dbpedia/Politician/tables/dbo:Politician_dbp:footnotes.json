  "text" : "Andre Kasongo Ilunga (* angeblich 20. Oktober 1972) bekleidete ab dem 5. Februar 2007 als Vertreter der kongolesischen Kleinpartei Unafec (Nationale Union der Föderalisten des Kongo) für einen Tag den Posten des Außenhandelsministers der Demokratischen Republik Kongo. Wahrscheinlich ist diese Person rein fiktiv. Unklar ist, auf wessen Betreiben und warum das nichtexistente Parteimitglied der Unafec auf die Liste der Minister des Kongo geriet. Kasongo Ilunga war einer von 60 Ministern und Vizeministern, die am 5. Februar 2007 vom Kabinett des Präsidenten Joseph Kabila nominiert wurden. Vorgeschlagen worden war er dem Premierminister Antoine Gizenga im Januar 2007 von der Parteiführung der Unafec, die ihn mitsamt Foto als Vizepräsidenten des Unafec-Ortsvereins Masina in Kongos Hauptstadt Kinshasa vorstellte und gemeinsam mit dem Parteichef Kisimba Ngoy als Ministerkandidaten ihrer Partei zur Auswahl stellte. Gizenga entschied sich für Ilunga Kasongo. Bereits am Tag nach der Regierungsbildung reichte Kasongo allerdings angeblich schriftlich bei seinem Parteichef seinen Rücktritt ein. Der Unafec-Provinzchef von Katanga, der angeblichen Heimatprovinz Ilungas, erklärte kurz darauf öffentlich, dass es kein Parteimitglied dieses Namens in Katanga gebe. Zwei Theorien kursieren, wie es zur Ernennung des offenkundig nicht-existenten Ilunga gekommen sein könnte. Nach der ersten Theorie hatte die Partei nicht mit der Ernennung Ilungas gerechnet und nur beabsichtigt, das Vorhandensein personeller Alternativen in der Partei vorzutäuschen. Die zweite Theorie bezieht sich darauf, dass der Unafec-Parteichef als Nachfolger Kasongo Ilungas einen „Pierre Ilunga“ vorschlug. Pierre Ilunga jedoch ist ein politisch diskreditierter ehemaliger Justizminister der früheren Kriegsherr-Regierung des Kongo, der auf diese verwickelte Weise u. U. in die Regierung kommen sollte. Eine Klarstellung des Regierungssprechers Godefroid Mayombo, dass Kasongo Ilunga mitnichten eine fiktive Person sei, führte dazu, dass sich innerhalb weniger Tage drei Personen mit dem im Kongo recht häufigen Namen Kasongo Ilunga meldeten und den Posten des Ministers beanspruchten. Alle drei wurden jedoch vom Unafec-Parteichef als Betrüger bloßgestellt.",

Il est élu une première fois au Fale i Fono (parlement national) lors des élections législatives d'août 2006, en tant que député de Nukufetau. Il est alors nommé ministre des Finances, de la Planification économique et des Industries dans le gouvernement du premier ministre Apisai Ielemia. Il conserve son siège de député lors des élections législatives de 2010, mais le nouveau premier ministre Maatia Toafa ne le reconduit pas au gouvernement. Trois mois plus tard, en décembre, Metia aide Willy Telavi à renverser le gouvernement Toafa par une motion de confiance. Telavi devient premier ministre et nomme Metia ministre des Finances. Le mois suivant, en janvier 2011, des citoyens de sa circonscriptions demandent sa démission, mécontents qu'il ait rejoint le gouvernement Telavi. Une manifestation pacifique a lieu à Funafuti, la capitale ; en réponse, le gouvernement décrète l'état d'urgence et interdit temporairement tout rassemblement de dix personnes ou plus. Des membres du falekaupule de son île, le « puissant conseil des anciens », tentent en vain de le persuade de rejoindre l'Opposition parlementaire et d'aider à porter celle-ci au pouvoir. En septembre 2012, il tombe malade, et passe les mois qui suivent en Nouvelle-Zélande. Il retourne aux Tuvalu pour voter en faveur du budget au Parlement le 13 décembre. Il est admis au centre de soins intensifs de son pays, puis est dépêché aux Fidji le 20 décembre pour y être hospitalisé. Il décède à l'hôpital à Suva le lendemain. La nature de sa maladie n'a pas été rendue publique. Son décès prive le gouvernement Telavi d'une majorité claire au Parlement : il ne dispose plus que de sept sièges, soit autant que l'opposition. Dès lors, le gouvernement ne convoque plus le Parlement. Une élection partielle doit se tenir pour le siège laissé vacant par Metia, à Nukufetau ; Telavi parvient à retarder sa tenue jusqu'à ce qu'une décision de justice le contraigne à permettre cette élection, le 28 juin 2013. Le siège est remporté par le candidat de l'opposition, Elisala Pita. L'opposition demande alors que le Parlement soit convoqué, afin que le gouvernement puisse être destitué par une motion de censure déposée par la nouvelle majorité. S'en suit une crise constitutionnelle, qui aboutit à la chute du gouvernement Telavi.",

MacInnis defeated Gillis again in a rematch almost a year later in the 1958 general election, known as the \"Diefenbaker Sweep.\" MacInnis remained a Member of Parliament throughout the 1960s and early 1970s except for the 25th Parliament when he was defeated in the riding by Malcolm Vic MacInnis of the New Democratic Party in the 1962 election. Since the 1968 election, MacInnis represented Cape Breton—East Richmond, one of the ridings which replaced the Cape Breton South electoral district in a boundary realignment. After his term in the 29th Parliament ended in 1974, MacInnis left national office and did not campaign for another term.

  "text" : "Daniel C. Itse, known as Dan Itse (born May 21, 1958), is a conservative Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. A native of San Francisco, California, Itse is a professional engineer who resides in Fremont, New Hampshire. He advocates the revival of state sovereignty in an era of otherwise expanded government through the revival of the 1798 Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively, to permit the empowerment of individual states within the federal Union. Itse has explained his proposition on the national Glenn Beck interview program on Fox news. Itse's resolution in the New Hampshire legislature inspired other state legislatures to do the same (possibly as many as 20.) When he was eight years old, Itse moved with his family to Sherborn, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1976 from Dover-Sherborn High School. and then enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, from which in 1980 he procured a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering. He earned a master of science in the same field in 1986, also from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He is a registered professional engineer in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. From 1979-1989, he worked for the Riley Stoker Corporation. He was chief engineer of Physical Sciences, Inc., from 1989-1994. Since 1994, he has owned Christofferson Engineering. An inventor, Itse holds patents on (1) a low-emissions burner for coal-fired power plants, (2) a low-emissions combustion system for waste-to-energy, (3) a process for disposing of heavy metals, and (4) a device to enhance the injection of chemicals for reducing pollution from power plants. In 2009, Itse was working on the air pollution control system for the largest wood-fired power plant in North America. Since 2001, Itse has represented Rockingham County, which is located in the southeastern corner of the state, in the legislature, which meets in the capital city of Concord. He has served on the Children and Family Law and the Science, Technology and Energy committees. He once had the best attendance record in the legislature. He claims to vote in all cases in accordance with a literal reading of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, and personal liberty and property. In the 2011/2012 term he was the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification. In that term he saw the creation of the Committee on Redress of Grievances Chaired by Rep. Paul Ingbretson. The peoples right of redress as a positive right in New Hampshire was brought to light as a result of his commentary on the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, \"The People's Liberty\". An advocate of judicial reform, Itse supports constitutional amendments regarding the recognition of marriage, parental rights, prohibiting a state income tax, and affirming the right to petition the legislature for redress of grievances. He is a nationally prominent advocate of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the assertion of state sovereignty.Though his sovereignty amendment was rejected by his New Hampshire colleagues, it inspired similar proposals in some twenty states as well as the \"Tea Party\" demonstrations in April 2009. In 1979, while he was a senior in college, Itse married the former Lisa Mullins. The couple has five children, born between 1983 and 1995. The youngest, Jarrod, is handicapped. In the 2008 Republican presidential contest, Itse was a supporter of U.S. Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado. Itse is scheduled to address the national committee meeting of the Constitution Party to be held June 11–13 in Newark, New Jersey. In 2014 Itse authored \"States Have Powers - the Powers of the People, use 'em or lose 'em\" (available on Amazon). The book is an expository on his 2012 sovereignty resolution. It explains why the People are in fact in supreme power in America, and the intended distribution of power between the government of the United States and the States and between the three branches of government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial. At their 2015 Liberty Dinner, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance revealed that Itse was chosen as legislator of the year.",
