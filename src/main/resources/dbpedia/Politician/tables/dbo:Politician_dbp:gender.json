  "text" : "Kenneth Daniel Gallegos Miyagishima (born May 15, 1963) is the current mayor of Las Cruces, New Mexico, first taking office in 2007. Miyagishima was born in Biloxi, Mississippi. He is of both Japanese and Mexican descent. He has lived in Las Cruces since 1971. He attended public schools and in 1985 graduated from New Mexico State University with degrees in finance and real estate. In 1984 Miyagishima began his insurance and financial services business while still in college. In 1992 he became New Mexico’s first American of Japanese descent to be elected to public office. From 1998 through 2000 he was voted “Best County Commissioner” in a local newspaper readers’ poll. Miyagishima’s accomplishments were included in Distinguished Asian-American Political and Governmental Leaders, printed by Greenwood Press. In 2002, he received the Commander’s Award for Public Service from the Department of the Army. Miyagishima won re-election as City Councilman in 2005 running unopposed. Miyagishima is the first American of Japanese and Mexican descent to be elected Mayor of Las Cruces. He is also the second person in Doña Ana County to have been elected both Chairman of the Doña Ana County Commission and Mayor of Las Cruces. Miyagishima is a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national, bipartisan coalition of American mayors who advocate for Universal Background Checks, gun & ammo registration/restriction while creating exceptions for law enforcement and personal bodyguards. In August 2013, Miyagishima applied to become Doña Ana County Manager, but the following month he was told that he had not been successful, as other candidates were better qualified.",
