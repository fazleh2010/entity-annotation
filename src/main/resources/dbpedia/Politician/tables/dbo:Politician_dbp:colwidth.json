Craigmyle sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Hawick Burghs from 1892 to 1909 and served as Solicitor General for Scotland from 1894 to 1895 and as Lord Advocate from December 1905 to 1909. He resigned from parliament and ministerial office and was created a life peer as Baron Shaw, of Dunfermline in the County of Fife, on 20 February 1909, so that he could sit in the House of Lords and serve as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. He retired from this office in 1929 and was made an hereditary peer as Baron Craigmyle, of Craigmyle in the County of Aberdeen, on 7 Mar 1929. Lord Craigmyle married Elspeth, daughter of George Forrest, in 1879. He died in June 1937, aged 87, and was succeeded in the hereditary barony by his son Alexander. Lady Craigmyle died in 1939.",

  "text" : "Mario Felice Ferri (born January 6, 1948, Pescosolido, Italy) is an Italian-Canadian community organizer, activist, and a former deputy mayor of Vaughan, Ontario, who co-founded an organization credited with helping to force the closure of Canada’s largest municipal waste facility, the Keele Valley Landfill. At the time of its closure the waste facility was the third largest in North America near the heart of Vaughan, the fifth largest city in the Greater Toronto Area. The waste landfill site became the centre of a 14 year battle between the citizens of Vaughan and both the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, which owned and operated the site. Mr. Ferri co-founded Vaughan CARES, an activist group that became prominent in the fight to close the waste facility. As a community organizer Ferri also contributed to numerous cultural organizations and helped organize large events, as well as administering community recreational facilities in Toronto, Vaughan and other surrounding communities. In his roles as a York Region Separate School Board trustee, municipal and regional councillor and deputy mayor he undertook several community campaigns and frequently acted as a spokesperson for the school board, the City of Vaughan and for York Region. In October 2014 Ferri was elected to his fifth term as a councillor for the City of Vaughan and his third term as a councillor for the Region of York, Ontario.",
