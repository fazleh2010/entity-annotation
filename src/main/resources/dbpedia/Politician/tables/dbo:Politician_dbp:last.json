He became a member of the Swedish Privy Council in 1609 and served as Lord High Chancellor of Sweden from 1612 until his death. He was a confidant of first Gustavus Adolphus and then Queen Christina. Oxenstierna is widely considered one of the most influential people in Swedish history. He played an important role during the Thirty Years' War and was appointed Governor-General of occupied Prussia; he is also credited for having laid the foundations of the modern central administrative structure of the State, including the creation of counties (Swedish: län).",

  "text" : "Albert Edgar Solomon (7 March 1876 – 5 October 1914) was an Australian politician. He was Premier of Tasmania from 14 June 1912 to 6 April 1914. Solomon graduated B.A. in 1895 and LL.B. in 1897 at the University of Tasmania, and subsequently qualified for the degrees of M.A. and LL.M. He was admitted to the bar in February 1898. He entered politics as one of the six MHAs for Bass in April 1909, and almost immediately became attorney-general and minister for education in the Elliott Lewis second and third ministries, taking the additional position of minister of mines in October 1909. When Lewis retired in June 1912 Solomon became premier, attorney-general and minister of education, but he had a bare majority of one and it required much tact and finesse to keep the ministry going until April 1914. Attention was given to education and considerable additions were made to the number of state and high schools. Never a robust man, Solomon felt the strain of office – his health broke down, and he died at Hobart aged 38 on 5 October 1914. He was survived by his wife and two sons. He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church and a temperance reformer.",
