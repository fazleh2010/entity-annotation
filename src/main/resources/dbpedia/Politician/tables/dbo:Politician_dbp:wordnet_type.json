  "text" : "Kris Hanna (born 1962) is an Australian politician, and former member for Mitchell in the South Australian House of Assembly from 1997 until 2010. Originally elected as a member of the Australian Labor Party, Hanna joined the SA Greens in 2003 before becoming an independent member in 2006. Before entering Parliament, Hanna practised law. He also served as a Councillor for the City of Marion from 1995 to 1997. He returned to practicing law in 2010 and, in 2014 was elected unopposed as Mayor of the City of Marion. Hanna is currently on the Board of Victim Support Service, and is Patron of numerous local sporting clubs. He was the longest-serving member of the Seaview High School Governing Council and had been President of Friends of Glenthorne and the Reynella Business & Tourism Association. While initially elected at the 1997 and 2002 elections as a member of the Labor Party, he moved to the Greens in early 2003. He ultimately resigned from the Greens on 8 February 2006 and ran in the 2006 election as an independent and won. His chances of retaining his seat in 2006 had been essentially written off by most commentators after his decision to become an Independent MP, but he won a narrow victory after a very low Liberal primary vote and an endorsement from popular Independent MP Nick Xenophon. He narrowly lost at the 2010 election despite an improved vote, due to finishing third after all non-major party preferences had been distributed. Hanna sought to have his 2010 election loss overturned by the Supreme Court of South Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, saying he fell victim to \"misleading and defamatory\" leaflets and posters distributed by the Labor Party. The court ruled the leaflets - labelling Hanna \"soft on crime\" - were defamatory and not factual, yet there was a right to express such opinions. The court dismissed Hanna's case. Hanna unsuccessfully re-contested the seat of Mitchell at the 2014 election. Some of the local issues Hanna was known to campaign for were: upgrading the Oaklands rail crossing, making Glenthorne a forested recreational park, and turning the old O’Halloran Hill TAFE site into a high school.",

  "text" : "Karl Albert Staaff (Estocolmo, 21 de enero de 1860 - ibídem, 4 de octubre de 1915) fue un político sueco, dos veces primer ministro de su país. Abogado de profesión, fue jefe del Partido Coalición Liberal entre 1907 y 1915, y ocupó el cargo de primer ministro entre el 7 de noviembre de 1905 y el 29 de mayo de 1906, y por segunda vez entre el 7 de octubre de 1911 y el 17 de febrero de 1914. Estuvo activo en el movimiento sueco por el sufragio universal y como primer ministro por el Partido Liberal, impulsó en 1905 la introducción del sufragio democrático limitado para los hombres. Su sucesor Nils Edén finalmente logró dar un paso más allá y llegar al sufragio universal en 1918. Staaff intervino en un duro conflicto con el establishment sueco conservador, y se convirtió en una figura odiada entre los conservadores, monárquicos y anti-democráticos.Se lanzó una intensa campaña de difamación contra él, pintándolo como el destructor de la tradición y la sociedad suecas: los estocolmeses ricos llegarían hasta comprar bandejas hechas con la forma de su cabeza. Sus políticas acérrimamente antimilitaristas ganeraron la mayor campaña de recolección de fondos en la historia de Suecia hasta ese momento, las 12 millones de coronas para el acorazado costero HMS Sverige, que fueron obtenidas en pocos meses en 1912. Staaff habría de morder el anzuelo, y el acorazado se construyó. En 1914 Staaff renunció al gobierno, en señal de protesta, después de que los conservadores convocaran una manifestación de agricultores frente al castillo de la corte real en Estocolmo, donde el rey Gustavo V -que de acuerdo a la ley debía permanecer ajeno a la política- denunció las políticas de defensa pacifistas de Staaff, en lo que se denominó la \"Crisis del Patio\". El actual partido liberal sueco Partido Liberal del Pueblo lo considera como el primero entre los más prominentes líderes del liberalismo sueco durante el Siglo XX, seguido por parlamentarios como Nils Edén, Carl Ekman, el Premio Nobel Bertil Ohlin, Gunnar Helén, Per Ahlmark y Bengt Westerberg.",

Growing up, Nijhar recollects the times he had to stay in a kampung house without any basic amenities and had to depend on wells for water, and Hindu temples for free meals because of poverty. While a student at St Xavier's Institution in Penang, he used to earn money as a ball boy at clubs with tennis courts. But this did not stop him from excelling in school. He topped the school examinations between 1947 and 1954. “My passion to serve the community exceeds my desire to make money in the business world,” he said, adding that he had saved the Selangor MIC building from being auctioned off, and had also refinanced two of his cars to organise a national economic congress in 1980. In the Malaysian parliament, he sits on the Public Accounts Committee. He had also served on the National Unity Committee. Nijhar was dropped as a candidate for the 2008 general elections. The Barisan Nasional candidate for the constituency, S. Murugeson was defeated by the candidate from the Justice Party, Sivarasa Rasiah.",

Februar 2007 als Vertreter der kongolesischen Kleinpartei Unafec (Nationale Union der Föderalisten des Kongo) für einen Tag den Posten des Außenhandelsministers der Demokratischen Republik Kongo. Wahrscheinlich ist diese Person rein fiktiv. Unklar ist, auf wessen Betreiben und warum das nichtexistente Parteimitglied der Unafec auf die Liste der Minister des Kongo geriet. Kasongo Ilunga war einer von 60 Ministern und Vizeministern, die am 5. Februar 2007 vom Kabinett des Präsidenten Joseph Kabila nominiert wurden. Vorgeschlagen worden war er dem Premierminister Antoine Gizenga im Januar 2007 von der Parteiführung der Unafec, die ihn mitsamt Foto als Vizepräsidenten des Unafec-Ortsvereins Masina in Kongos Hauptstadt Kinshasa vorstellte und gemeinsam mit dem Parteichef Kisimba Ngoy als Ministerkandidaten ihrer Partei zur Auswahl stellte. Gizenga entschied sich für Ilunga Kasongo. Bereits am Tag nach der Regierungsbildung reichte Kasongo allerdings angeblich schriftlich bei seinem Parteichef seinen Rücktritt ein. Der Unafec-Provinzchef von Katanga, der angeblichen Heimatprovinz Ilungas, erklärte kurz darauf öffentlich, dass es kein Parteimitglied dieses Namens in Katanga gebe. Zwei Theorien kursieren, wie es zur Ernennung des offenkundig nicht-existenten Ilunga gekommen sein könnte. Nach der ersten Theorie hatte die Partei nicht mit der Ernennung Ilungas gerechnet und nur beabsichtigt, das Vorhandensein personeller Alternativen in der Partei vorzutäuschen. Die zweite Theorie bezieht sich darauf, dass der Unafec-Parteichef als Nachfolger Kasongo Ilungas einen „Pierre Ilunga“ vorschlug. Pierre Ilunga jedoch ist ein politisch diskreditierter ehemaliger Justizminister der früheren Kriegsherr-Regierung des Kongo, der auf diese verwickelte Weise u. U. in die Regierung kommen sollte. Eine Klarstellung des Regierungssprechers Godefroid Mayombo, dass Kasongo Ilunga mitnichten eine fiktive Person sei, führte dazu, dass sich innerhalb weniger Tage drei Personen mit dem im Kongo recht häufigen Namen Kasongo Ilunga meldeten und den Posten des Ministers beanspruchten. Alle drei wurden jedoch vom Unafec-Parteichef als Betrüger bloßgestellt.",

His taxing recommendations to pay for the improvements were not fully enacted, and the project ultimately led the state to negotiate a partial bankruptcy only a few years later. The debacle led to a gradual collapse of the state Whig party, which never regained control of the government, and led to a period of Democratic control that lasted until the middle of the American Civil War. After his term as governor he was appointed to the Board of Internal Improvement where he unsuccessfully advocated a reorganization of the projects in an attempt to gain some benefit from them.",

He was a member of the Udall political family and was also a nephew of Spencer W. Kimball, the 12th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Udall was born and raised in Arizona. His parents John Hunt Udall and Ruth Kimball were in the same English literature class at the St. Joseph Stake Academy (now Eastern Arizona College), and when learning about playwright Nicholas Udall, they joked that if they ever got married, that they would name their son Nick, which they did. Udall attended Brigham Young University and the University of Arizona before enrolling in The George Washington University Law School, graduating in 1943. After graduation, he returned home to Arizona, where he began his law practice. He followed in his father's footsteps, and served as mayor of Phoenix from 1948 to 1952. He served with then-City Councilman Barry Goldwater. From 1952 to 1956 he served as judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court. Nick left the bench to return to private legal practice at Jennings, Strouss, Salmon & Trask in Phoenix, where he practiced law until retiring in 1992. A lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Nick served in various church positions, including service as a full-time missionary in the Eastern Central States mission from 1934 to 1936, as Bishop of the Phoenix Third Ward from 1970 to 1975 (\"the most satisfying calling that a worthy priesthood holder can have\" because \"he is continually helping people\"), and as Patriarch of the Phoenix Arizona Stake from 1975 to 1991. Nick and his wife, Sybil Elizabeth Webb, are the parents of seven children. They are buried alongside each other in Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona. Following Sybil's death in 1998, Nick married Joan Romney in 2001. His autobiography, \"The Wonder of It All,\" was published by FCP Publishing in 2006.",

  "text" : "Nobuto Hosaka (jap. 保坂 展人, Hosaka Nobuto; * 26. November 1955 in Sendai, Präfektur Miyagi) ist ein japanischer Politiker und gehörte für die Sozialdemokratische Partei (SDP) von 1996 bis 2003 und von 2005 bis 2009 dem Shūgiin, dem Unterhaus des nationalen Parlaments an. Hosaka war bereits in seiner Schulzeit in nationalen linken Schülerverbänden aktiv, die Shinjuku-Oberschule der Präfektur Tokio (Tōkyō-to-ritsu Shinjuku kōtō-gakkō) verließ er ohne Abschluss. In den 1980er Jahren war er als Bildungsjournalist tätig und setzte sich für antiautoritäre Bildungsformen ein. Bei der Shūgiin-Wahl 1996 kandidierte Hosaka gleichzeitig im Einzelwahlkreis Tokio 22, den er abgeschlagen auf Platz fünf verlor, und über die neu geschaffene Verhältniswahl für die SDP im Block Tokio. Da er alleine auf Listenplatz eins gesetzt war erhielt er den einzigen Sitz, den die Sozialdemokraten im Block Tokio gewannen. Dort wurde er 2000, als er den Wahlkreis Tokio 6 verlor, sowie noch einmal 2005 wiedergewählt, als die SDP eigentlich kein Mandat im Block Tokio erhalten hätte, aber einen Sitz gewann, weil die Liberaldemokratische Partei zu wenige Kandidaten nominiert hatte. Bei der Shūgiin-Wahl 2009 wechselte er erneut den Wahlkreis und trat im 8. Wahlkreis gegen Nobuteru Ishihara, den Sohn des Gouverneurs von Tokio, an, unterlag um rund 30.000 Stimmen. Da die SDP ohne Verhältniswahlmandat blieb, schied er aus dem Parlament aus. In seiner Zeit als Abgeordneter war er unter anderem Mitglied des Justizausschusses und Generalsekretär der Parlamentariergruppe für die Abschaffung der Todesstrafe von Shizuka Kamei. Bei der Sangiin-Wahl 2010 versuchte Hosaka über die landesweite Verhältniswahl den Wechsel ins nationale Oberhaus, erhielt knapp 70.000 Präferenzstimmen und erreichte damit den Listenplatz 3 – die SDP gewann aber nur zwei Verhältniswahlmandate. Bei den einheitlichen Regionalwahlen im April 2011 wurde er aus einem Feld von fünf Kandidaten zum Bürgermeister von Setagaya, der bevölkerungsreichsten Gemeinde der Präfektur Tokio, gewählt.",

  "text" : "Gaius Julius Caesar (Classical Latin: [ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar]; 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence. After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\", giving him additional authority. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus. A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.",

  "text" : "John Jeremy Thorpe, PC (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the Liberal Party between 1967 and 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, based on his earlier relationship with Norman Scott, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and the furore surrounding it, ended his political career. Thorpe was the son and grandson of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with neither of the main parties attaining a majority (\"Hung parliament\"), Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government. The February 1974 election proved to be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence on the grounds that the prosecution had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.",

  "text" : "John Hutchyns Tyndall' (14 July 1934 – 19 July 2005) was a British National Socialist. As a prominent figure in British nationalism during the second half of the twentieth century, Tyndall was involved during the 1960s with neo-Nazi movements, most notably being the deputy leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement under Colin Jordan. However, he is best known for leading the National Front (NF) in the late 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Born in Devon, Tyndall undertook national service prior to reading the work of Adolf Hitler and involving himself in extreme-right politics. In the mid-1950s he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Growing frustrated with the LEL's approach, in 1957 he co-founded the National Labour Party (NLP) with John Bean. In 1960 the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Tyndall grew close to Jordan and together they embraced an overt Neo-Nazi approach to racial nationalism, establishing a paramilitary group called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement. In 1962 he was convicted and imprisoned for establishing a paramilitary organisation. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall then formed his Greater Britain Movement, another explicitly Neo-Nazi group, in 1964. In 1967 Tyndall joined the newly established National Front, which was then led by Chesterton. He took on the role of Vice Chairman and eventually assumed the position of Chairman in 1972. His leadership was however threatened by both a 'populist moderate' faction and a Strasserite faction. In 1974 he was deposed as Chairman and briefly expelled from the party the following year. On his return he resumed his position as Chairman, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980, forming his short-lived New National Front. In 1982 he established the new British National Party, which grew into the most prominent extreme-right group in the UK by the late 1980s. Electoral success however largely eluded the party. Tyndall's refusal to moderate any of the party's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of 'modernisers', who succeeded in ousting him in 1999, when he was replaced by Nick Griffin. Tyndall retained his affiliation with the BNP for the following few years prior to his death.",

At age 31 he became the state's youngest governor and served from 1825 to 1831, the longest period for an Indiana governor under the state constitution of 1816. During Ray's term as governor the state experienced a period of economic prosperity and a 45 percent population increase. He supported projects that encouraged the continued growth and development of the young state, most notably internal improvements, Native American removal, codification of Indiana's laws, improved county and local government, and expanded educational opportunities. Ray was known for his eccentricity and early promotion of a large-scale railroad system in the state. His support for new railroad construction and alleged involvement in several scandals caused him to lose popularity among voters. Ray's opponents who favored the creation of canals considered railroads to be an impractical, utopian idea. Following Ray's departure from political office, he continued to advocate for a statewide railroad system until his death in 1848.",

De Witt controlled the Netherlands political system from around 1650 until shortly before his death in 1672 working with various factions from nearly all the major cities, especially his hometown, Dordrecht, and the city of birth of his wife, Amsterdam. As a republican he opposed the House of Orange. He was also strongly liberal, preferring lesser power to the central government and more power to the regenten. However, his negligence of the Dutch land army (as the regents focused only on merchant vessels, thinking they could avoid war) proved disastrous when the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar. In the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of three countries, he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague.",

  "text" : "Jonathan Jennings (March 27, 1784 – July 26, 1834) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine-term congressman from Indiana. Born in either Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806. Jennings initially intended to practice law, but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself, and pursued interests in land speculation and politics. Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career. In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown, in Clark County. He was elected as the Indiana Territory's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate. By 1812 he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government. Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812. As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816, which authorized the organization of Indiana's state government and state constitution. He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention, held in Corydon in June 1816, where he helped draft the state's first constitution. Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government. In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements. Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life. His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years. Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings's life and impact on the development of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings's importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen's assessment that the state \"owes him more than she can compute.\"",

Hank has long been target of diverse rumors and accusations by the media and political rivals, like having links with organized crime, or being related to the 1988 murder of an Investigative Journalist in Tijuana. Also, in 2011 Mexican troops raided his property without a warrant and allegedly seized 88 firearms, 2 of which could be linked to homicides by ballistic evidence. Hank's defense lawyer, told the judge that all was political Frameup to prevent him from running for the 2013 state elections, being most of the weapons were planted by the military. The federal judge ruled that the raid was performed without a warrant, and that all evidence against Hank was inadmissible. No formal charges of any crime have ever successfully been leveled against him.",

In 1860, Lane was nominated for Vice President of the pro-slavery Southern wing of the Democratic Party, as John C. Breckinridge's running mate. Lane's pro-slavery views and sympathy for the Confederate States of America in the Civil War effectively ended his political career in Oregon.

Currently a government affairs counselor for K & L Gates in Washington, DC, Walsh retired from the United States House of Representatives in 2009 after serving for twenty years. Walsh represented a portion of Central New York, that is now known as the state's 24th Congressional District. While in Congress, Walsh was a member of the United States House Committee on Appropriations for 16 years, also chairing several of its subcommittees. As chair of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, alone, Walsh had spending oversight of more than $100 billion during the 109th Congress. In his capacities as chair and member of committees, subcommittees, and caucuses in Congress, Walsh secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds for veterans affairs, healthcare, technology, the environment, higher educational institutions, and many other areas. Walsh was further active in the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which the Walsh Visa was created and named in his honor. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus, Walsh secured passage of laws aimed at guaranteeing universal hearing screenings for newborns and infants in the United States. In 2009, an act that he proposed and which was enacted that achieved this effort was renamed for him in his honor, becoming known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Walsh's change of perspective regarding both of then-President George W. Bush's troop surge of 2007 and ideology regarding the Iraq War, caused Walsh's views to gain headlines in the news media, as well as for additionally desiring a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. For one decade during the 1970s and 1980s, Walsh was active on the Syracuse City Council, serving as its leader for five years. In 1999, he issued a challenge with several goals that is known as The Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative (SNI) for revitalization of the city. The many phases of SNI have been successful in improving neighborhoods and housing in numerous areas of the city. Generally known as a moderate, pro-labor Republican, Walsh currently lives in Washington, DC with his wife, Dede. Walsh's father, William F. Walsh, served as Mayor of Syracuse during the 1960s, as well as a Republican Congress Member of the House of Representatives in the 1970s.",

In 1852 Dole retired, and the firm, which was for a time known as Rumsey Brothers, devoted itself exclusively to the grain commission business. Rumsey was identified with the history of Chicago for more than half a century. During that period he was mayor, county treasurer, and president of the Chicago Board of Trade. He was a charter member of the Board of Trade, and through his efforts the present system of grain inspection and grading was adopted. This achievement gave him the title of the “Father of Grain Inspection.” Mr. Rumsey always took an interest in national and state politics. In 1861, during the period that preceded the Civil War, he did much, as mayor, to arouse the enthusiasm of his fellow citizens in favor of the preservation of the Union, and at the mass meeting in Metropolitan Hall a few days after the firing on Fort Sumter, he delivered a stirring address. He was a member of the first war finance committee, and of the Republican state committee the same year. During the Panic of 1873 he was president of the Corn Exchange National Bank.

This period has been described as the company's \"golden period of expansion and diversification\" though safety and health violations following an investigation of the fatal explosion at BP's Texas City, Texas, plant on 23 March 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured more than 170 others, resulted in fines and awards being given out.Browne was lauded during this period, as he engineered a merger with rival Amoco, and gained access to Russian oil reserves with the creation of TNK-BP. Nicknamed by employees the \"Sun King\" for his management style, he was also praised for increasing BP's interest in renewable energy sources. He resigned from BP in controversial circumstances after a judge found he had lied in court about the details of a personal relationship (though charges of perjury were never brought). He is a former President of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2006 to July 2011). Since 2001, he has been a crossbench member of the House of Lords.

  "text" : "Jacquelin Holzman (born c. 1936) served as mayor of Ottawa, Canada, from 1991 to 1997. Never attending university, she married at age nineteen and started a family. She became a volunteer, especially on causes relating to the disabled. She was elected to Ottawa city council in 1982 representing the Richmond Ward (now Bay Ward), defeating future mayor Bob Chiarelli, and became one of the more right-leaning city councillors. Acclaimed in the 1985 election, she soon ran into controversy in her second term over an expansion to the Carlingwood Shopping Centre. Holzman supported the expansion but many of her constituents were opposed. In the 1988 Ottawa election, she faced a strong challenge from Alex Cullen but was re-elected with a solid majority. She was a close ally of mayor Jim Durrell and was described as his heir apparent. When he chose not to run for re-election, Holzman ran against left-leaning councillor Nancy Smith. Holzman ran on a pro-development and tax cut platform and defeated Smith and interim mayor Marc Laviolette. During her first term, she worked for the 'Yes' side in the Charlottetown Accord referendum. She worked hard to increase Ottawa's international status. In 1993 she represented Ottawa in Tokyo at the Third Capitals of the World Conference. In the same month, she led a trade mission to Taiwan to promote Taiwanese investment and tourism in Ottawa. During her term, she was a strong supporter of Taiwan establishing an office in Ottawa. In the 1994 mayoral election she faced a number of challengers. She was accused of arrogance for planning an expedition to China under the assumption she would win re-election. Her second term was also mostly uneventful. One major debate was over the mayor's desire to add an expensive unity tower to the new city hall. The tower was left unfinished, as it remains today. In November 1996 she announced that she would not run for re-election, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. She was expected to face a difficult election against city councillor Jim Watson. After leaving the mayor's office, she became head of the Ottawa Congress Centre. The next year she was diagnosed with breast cancer, but was treated successfully, and became an advocate for breast cancer related causes. In 2002 she became chair of the Ottawa Health Research Institute. She remained head of the Congress Centre before retiring in 2004. In 2007 she was appointed to the board of the National Capital Commission.",

His positions created a rift between him and the Indiana General Assembly who overrode all of his anti-banking vetoes. He responded by launching legal challenges to the acts, but was ruled against by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia.",

  "text" : "John W. Morgan, (born May 7, 1964), is a Canadian lawyer, politician, and businessman. He was the mayor of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia from 2000 to 2012. Morgan is a graduate of the University College of Cape Breton and St. Francis Xavier University where he received a bachelor of science degree, majoring in chemistry and minoring in mathematics. He attended Dalhousie University where he obtained a master's degree in business administration and a bachelor's degree in law under the combined MBA/LLB degree program, graduating in 1990. First elected in October 2000, Morgan has since been re-elected twice (in 2004 and 2008) with over 80% of the votes cast. Morgan filed a lawsuit on behalf of CBRM against the Government of Nova Scotia alleging unequal per capita provincial funding for his municipality. Morgan had applied to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board to reject the Boundary Review citing the citizenry want a downsized municipal council. The eventual decision was that the Boundary Review was flawed and will need to be re-done by 2010. On August 17, 2012, Morgan released a statement announcing that he would not reoffer in the 2012 municipal election. He was succeeded as mayor by Cecil Clarke.",

He served in the Virginia State Senate, and represented Virginia in the United States Senate when the state was readmitted after the American Civil War. He was United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a Democrat. Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the Freedmen's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate. Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He was caught in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.",

He is also the Executive Director of the Liberian Development Foundation. Running as the LERP (Liberian Equal Rights Party) presidential candidate in the 11 October 2005 elections, Korto placed seventh out of 22 candidates, receiving 3.3% of the vote nationally and the highest vote total in Nimba County, his home base. After his loss in the first round of voting, he endorsed candidate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for the second round vote against football star George Weah. Johnson-Sirleaf went on to win the election, with Korto's support being viewed as an important factor in her victory, and she appointed Korto to her cabinet as Minister of Education shortly after she took office in January 2006. Korto has a background as a teacher and holds a doctorate in education from the Catholic University of America in Washington DC.",

Andrews entered Parliament as MP for Mid Down in 1953 (replacing his father), a seat which he represented until his resignation in 1964, when he was elected to the Senate where he sat until the Parliament was prorogued in 1972. His election to the senate was following a cabinet reshuffle, in which Andrews accepted demotion to the politically unimportant position of Government Minister in the Senate. He held several Cabinet positions, including Minister in the Senate from 1964 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 1969. He was a contender for the position of Prime Minister on the retirement of Lord Brookeborough, but when it became clear that Terence O'Neill had a comfortable lead over both Andrews and Brian Faulkner in the parliamentary party, no contest was held. In 1969 he was approached by O'Neill to succeed him, but he refused and James Chichester-Clark was elected During the 1970 Bannside and South Antrim by-elections, Andrews was at the centre of the UUP's pluralist campaign against Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party, declaring \"What does Protestant Unionism mean? Does it mean that you have to put a sign over the door of the Unionist Party saying Protestants only?\" Andrews was knighted in 1973. In retirement, he served as President of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland.",

  "text" : "John Douglas (6 mars 1828 - 23 juillet 1904) était un homme politique australien d'origine britannique et le septième premier ministre du Queensland. Douglas est né à Londres. Il était le septième fils d'Henry Alexander Douglas et d'Elizabeth Dalzell, son épouse. Ses parents sont morts en 1837 et il a fait ses études à Harrow et à l'Université de Durham, où il a également obtenu son baccalauréat en arts en 1850. On raconte qu'il a fait ses études à Rugby School mais son nom ne figure pas dans la liste de l'école de son époque. Il est arrivé en Nouvelle-Galles du Sud en 1851 et a été nommé commissaire des mines d'or, mais il démissionna pour devenir fermier. Il fut ensuite élu député de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud dans la circonscription de Darling Downs puis de Camden avant de démissionner le 17 juillet 1861. Il s'installa au Queensland en 1863 et fut élu député de Port Curtis. Le 1er mars 1866, il devint Postmaster General dans le premier gouvernement d'Arthur Macalister. Il fut nommé par la suite sénateur mais fut élu par la suite député de la nouvelle circonscription des Downs est. Il obtint le portefeuille de ministre des finances dans le second gouvernement Macalister en décembre 1866, puis en mai 1867, celui de ministre des travaux publics. Il redevint postmaster general dans le gouvernement de Charles Lilley de décembre 1868 jusqu'en novembre 1869, date à laquelle il démissionna pour devenir agent-général (ambassadeur) pour le Queensland à Londres. En 1871, il retourna au Queensland et devint député de Maryborough lors des élections de 1875. Il fut nommé ministre des terres publiques dans le gouvernement de George Thorn de juin 1876 jusqu'en mars 1877, lorsqu'il devint premier ministre. Son parti fut battu lors des élections de janvier 1879 et Douglas abandonna la politique. Il fut pendant un certain temps dans la direction du Brisbane Courier, et en 1885 le gouvernement le nomma magistrat résident de l'île Thursday. Après le décès de Sir Peter Scratchley en décembre 1885, il devint commissaire spécial pour le protectorat britannique de Nouvelle-Guinée pendant presque trois ans, et montra ses capacités de tact dans ses rapports avec les populations locales. En 1889, il revint à son ancien poste sur l'île Thursday. Il se rendit en Angleterre en 1902 et à son retour, continua son œuvre jusqu'à sa mort dans l'île. Douglas a été marié deux fois, d'abord à Marie, la fille de J. Simpson, en 1861 puis, en 1877, à Sarah, la fille de Michael Hickey. Il eut quatre fils de son deuxième mariage, dont deux ont eu une carrière distinguée. Le plus jeune, Robert Johnstone Douglas, (1883-1972), a été nommé juge de la cour suprême du Queensland en 1923 et l'aîné, Edward Archibald Douglas, (1877-1947), a été nommé à un poste similaire, en mars 1929. Alex Douglas, le nouveau député de Gaven est son arrière-petit-fils.",

A school teacher, guidance councillor, principal, and later involved in adult education, correctional education and vocational training as a director at Lakeland College. He was elected in the 1988 federal election at the Beaver River electoral district for the Progressive Conservative party; however, he was terminally stricken with pancreatic cancer and never saw the first day of the 34th Canadian Parliament. Dahmer had entered Edmonton's Royal Alexandra Hospital on October 28, 1988, after suffering symptoms similar to adult onset type two diabetes, but the extent of his condition was not widely known until after election night. However, by the time cancer was discovered it was after the deadline to withdraw from the general election, and at that point it was not certain the cancer could not be successfully treated with chemotherapy. Dahmer died five days after the election, before the Deputy Clerk of the House of Commons could arrive to conduct a swearing-in ceremony. Despite this, parliamentary policy allowed Dahmer's widow to receive a $29,150 severance, which was equivalent to six months salary in office. This money was used to establish the John Dahmer Community Involvement Scholarship at Lakeland College. As of 2016, he continues to hold the record for the shortest term as a federal Member of Parliament in Canadian history.",

Hartley, a resident of Waterbury, represents the western half of the city as well as its southern suburbs of Naugatuck and Prospect in the Connecticut Senate. Hartley was born in Waterbury and graduated from Elms College and received a M.A. from Trinity College. Prior to being elected to the Connecticut Senate, Hartley served as a Connecticut state representative representing the 73rd District from 1984 to 2000. Hartley's predecessor as a state representative was future Governor John G. Rowland. Perhaps as a result, Hartley is generally considered among the more conservative and bipartisan members of the Democratic caucus. In 2007 she was believed to be the sole holdout from the strategy of Senate President Donald E. Williams, Jr. to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of a Democratic state bonding package. Rell had vetoed the package claiming it put the state too far into debt. Hartley opposed a billion dollar commitment to the Connecticut State University system and has been threatened with retribution from Democratic party leadership. On October 30 an agreement was reached between the Rell Administration, legislative Democratic leaders and Senator Hartley to resolve the bonding stalemate. The final bonding package was reduced by $400 million from the level vetoed by Rell and increased oversight was placed on funds for the Connecticut State University system. The Courant later reported that pressure was placed on fellow senators against Hartley by Senator Thomas Gaffey, who had an undisclosed intimate relationship with the lobbyist for the university system. In December 2008, Hartley was removed as the Chairman of the Higher Education Committee because of her independence and willingness to stand up to the Democratic leadership who was shielding Gaffey. In 2008, Hartley was one of three Democrats who supported Governor M. Jodi Rell's proposal for a Three Strikes Law against career violent criminals. In 2009, Hartley was the only Democrat in the State Senate that did not vote to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of the Healthcare Partnership bill, thereby preventing the bill from becoming law. In 2011, Hartley and Paul Doyle were the only two Democrats to vote against transgender rights legislation.",

He saw service in the eastern theater, and is best remembered for raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia, after its fall in 1865. After the war, de Peyster served overseas as a dignitary. When he returned to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly. His father disagreed with many of his political positions, and they eventually stopped speaking to each other. In 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, who owned the town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters.",

On his website, he calls himself Maryland's most independent Senator. In a letter on his homepage, signed with his name at the bottom he explains the reason he still serves on the General Assembly. He writes: \"Over the last 9 years, I have always voted my conscience placing my constituents’ best interests above anything else. As I promised 9 years ago, my votes have reflected fiscal conservatism combined with a great concern for protecting open space and saving the Chesapeake Bay.

In an interview with CBC Radio van Dongen said the suspension was a result of his being cited twice in one year for driving in excess of 41 km/h above the posted speed limit. Van Dongen featured prominently in anti-speeding advertising campaigns for the provincial government in recent years. Three days later, van Dongen resigned as Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor-General.

Chosen as the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party in 1996 following the resignation of Lynda Haverstock, Melenchuk was elected to the Legislature in the 1999 election. With the governing New Democrats in a minority government situation, the party entered a coalition agreement and all three Liberal MLAs — Melenchuk, Ron Osika and Jack Hillson — were appointed to the provincial cabinet. Melenchuk served as Minister of Education. The coalition was controversial among party members, however, and Hillson subsequently left to sit as an independent. Melenchuk stepped down as Liberal leader in 2001, and was succeeded by David Karwacki. Karwacki ordered Melenchuk and Osika to disband the coalition — however, both refused and officially left the Liberal caucus. They sat as independent MLAs until 2003, when they both ran for re-election as NDP candidates in the 2003 election. Both were, however, defeated by members of the Saskatchewan Party. In 2005, Melenchuk was named academic health sciences liaison between the Saskatchewan government and the University of Saskatchewan.",

The following year, when he ran for re-election, he lost in the Democratic primary to Bayonne's Democratic leader Matthew T. Cronin. Cain lost again in 1914, ending his political career. Cain died on January 17, 1937 in his home after a long illness at age 75. His funeral was at St. Henry's Church in Bayonne. He is buried in Holy Name Cemetery in Jersey City.",

  "text" : "Erich Honecker (German: [ˈeːʁɪç ˈhɔnɛkɐ]; 25 August 1912 – 29 May 1994) was a German politician who, as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, led the German Democratic Republic from 1971 until the weeks preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. From 1976 onward he was also the country's official head of state as chairman of the State Council following Willi Stoph's relinquishment of the post. Honecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned during the Nazi era. Following World War II, he was freed and soon relaunched his political activities, founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955. As the Security Secretary of the Party’s Central Committee in the new East German state, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore responsibility for the \"order to fire\" along the Inner German border. In 1971, he initiated a political power struggle that led, with Soviet support, to his replacing Walter Ulbricht as First Secretary of the Central Committee and as chairman of the state's National Defense Council. Under his command, the country adopted a programme of \"consumer socialism\" and moved toward the international community by normalising relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN, in what is considered one of his greatest political successes. As Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s under the liberalising reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system and was consequently forced to resign by his party in October 1989 as the Communist regime sought to retain its power. Honecker's eighteen years at the helm of the soon-to-collapse German Democratic Republic came to an end. Following German reunification, he escaped to the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991 but was extradited back to Germany a year later to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuses committed by the East German regime. However, the proceedings were abandoned due to illness and he was freed from custody to travel to join his family in exile in Chile, where he died in May 1994 from liver cancer.",

He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and the U.S. Senate from 1959 to 1971. In the 1968 presidential election, McCarthy was the first candidate to challenge incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States, running on an anti-Vietnam War platform. The unexpected vote total he achieved in the New Hampshire primary and his strong polling in the upcoming Wisconsin primary contributed to Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race, and lured Robert F. Kennedy into the contest. Fellow Minnesotan US Vice-President Hubert Humphrey also entered the race after Johnson's withdrawal. McCarthy would unsuccessfully seek the presidency five times altogether.",

He succeeded in maximizing the British labour supply, for both the armed services and domestic industrial production, with a minimum of strikes and disruption. His most important role came as Foreign Secretary in the post-war Labour Government, 1945–51. He gained American financial support, strongly opposed Communism, and aided in the creation of NATO. Bevin's tenure also saw the end of the Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the State of Israel. Bevin's role in British diplomatic history has been assessed by his biographer, Alan Bullock, Bevin: stands as the last of the line of foreign secretaries in the tradition created by Castlereagh, Canning and Palmerston in the first half of the 19th century, with Salisbury, Grey and Austen Chamberlain as his predecessors in the 20th century, and (thanks to the reduction in British power) with no successors.",

In 1993 he was elected as a Reform Member of Parliament in the Saskatchewan riding of Kindersley—Lloydminster. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 until 1995. Due to redistribution his hometown was located in the new constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar for the 1997 election. He ran against fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party for the new seat and lost. Hermanson sought the leadership of the newly founded Saskatchewan Party in 1998, and defeated Rod Gantefoer and Yogi Huyghebaert in a one member one vote election. He was elected to the provincial legislature for Rosetown-Biggar in the 1999 provincial election and became Leader of the Opposition. While the party reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party to a minority government, it was almost nonexistent outside the rural areas; it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party five seats short of making Hermanson Premier. Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in 2003. However, he came up short again in the provincial election that November, in which the NDP actually won a bare majority. While the Saskatchewan Party scored a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election and was subsequently succeeded by Brad Wall. Hermanson remained the MLA for the new constituency of Rosetown-Elrose. On Friday, June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature.",

Born to Stephen and Helen (née Lang) Kelly, he was the first of five Chicago mayors from Bridgeport of Chicago's South Side. Kelly was the chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District in the 1920s. He was sponsored by Patrick Nash, the owner of a sewer-contracting company that did millions of dollars of business with the city. He subsequently became president of the South Park Board, a position that presided over the building of Soldier Field. Under his tenure Soldier Field cost $8 million, while a similar Los Angeles stadium only cost $1.7 million. Kelly was Mayor of Chicago during the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair (Century of Progress) which took place during the Great Depression which included the successful playing of the first official Major League Baseball All-Star Game; Kelly initiated for holding a major sport event for the fair to the Chicago Tribune. Kelly was famous for banning Nelson Algren's 1942 book Never Come Morning, a novel, from the Chicago Public Library; the ban remained in force for decades due to the outcry by Chicago Polonia upon its release. Following the assassination of Mayor Anton Cermak, Kelly was hand-picked by his friend, Patrick Nash, Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, for the mayoral election of 1933. Together, Kelly and Nash built one of the most powerful, and most corrupt, big city political organizations, called the \"Kelly-Nash Machine\". In 1947, Kelly acquiesced to the Cook County Democratic Party's decision to slate a candidate with reform credentials for mayor of Chicago and was succeeded by Martin H. Kennelly.",

He defeated Liberal candidate Janice Laking, the incumbent mayor of Barrie, by a margin of 123 votes. Ironically, political analysts largely credited his victory over Laking to her popularity rather than his, suggesting that many voters in Barrie switched their votes only because they didn't want Laking to step down as mayor. Harper did not stand for reelection in the 1997 election. Before being elected to Parliament, Harper was a businessman in Barrie.",

  "text" : "Hoos was born in Neuwied am Rhine, Germany on August 31, 1850. He was an upholster and after immigrating to the United States, started a furniture business in Jersey City. His wife Dora Wilkins, of Hanover, Germany, died in 1890. In 1897, he was pushed by Democratic political boss, Robert Davis, to run for Mayor of Jersey City. The mayoral election of 1897 was very controversial. The Republican controlled state legislature passed the McArthur Act which postponed Jersey City and Newark's elections from the Spring to November to make them coincide with the state elections. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that this was unconstitutional. The Republicans appealed the Supreme Court's decision to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals. Since the decision was under appeal, the Republicans claimed that the elections planned for April 14 should not be held at that time until the court ruled on their appeal and if they were held then their results would not be valid until after the appeal was ruled on. The Democrats claimed they would be held and their results would be valid. Hoos won the election against Republican J. Herbert Potts, 15,264 votes to 12,018. however, Mayor Peter F. Wanser refused to vacate the mayor's office claiming the election was not valid until their appeal was heard in court. Hoos had to formally demand Wanser to leave the office on May 3, 1897. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled in September in favor of Hoos. Hoos won re-election over Republican Edward M. Watson by an even bigger margin of 7,000 votes on April 11, 1899. Hoos had served two terms (May 3, 1897 to December 31, 1901), but Boss Davis knew the voters wanted a change and dumped Hoos from the ticket in 1901 in favor of Edward L. Young (New Jersey), son of Edward Faitoute Condict Young (Davis' financial backing). It did not matter to the voters who swept in Republican Mark M. Fagan as mayor. Hoos died on October 24, 1912 and was buried in New York Bay Cemetery in Jersey City alongside his wife and three of his children.",

Fage was forced to take a leave of absence from the party caucus in January 2007 after allegations that he had engaged in criminal behaviour following a car accident on November 24, 2006. Fage was subsequently charged criminally with leaving the scene of an accident. Witnesses reported that Fage smelled of alcohol at the time of the accident, but he was not charged with an alcohol-related offense due to lack of evidence. He was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident, and fined $800, on December 18, 2007, and it was subsequently announced he would not be allowed back into caucus. Prior to the verdict Fage said he planned on running in the next election. He continued to sit as an independent MLA until the 2009 election, when he was defeated by Brian Skabar — notably, however, Fage finished in second place ahead of Keith Hunter, his replacement as the Progressive Conservative candidate. He had also previously been involved in a controversy around a government loan to a potato farm with which he had a personal business connection.",

The Special Investigating Team concluded that he was killed after he fired at an agitated mob outside his house. His widow Zakia Jafri has subsequently argued that the state of Gujarat and its then Chief Minister, now the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, was partly responsible for the violence and for the lack of police intervention in favor of the victims at Gulbarg Society. This argument has been rejected by a Special Investigation Committee which concluded that Modi had no responsibility for the incident.",

Schafer challenged the results in court, and was successful in having the election overturned, but Bruce won the resulting by-election by a clear margin.

  "text" : "Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin. Willkie was born in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was initially employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C&S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&S, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&S's property for a good price, and gained public esteem. A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters – many youthful – enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces under Hitler rampaged through western Europe in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states. After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.",

  "text" : "William Wilberforce (24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833) was an English politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to eradicate the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he became an Evangelical Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform. In 1787, he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad. In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.",

  "text" : "William Claiborne also, spelled Cleyburne (c. 1600 – c. 1677) was an English pioneer, surveyor, and an early settler in the colonies/provinces of Virginia and Maryland and around the Chesapeake Bay. Claiborne became a wealthy planter, a trader, and a major figure in the politics of the colonies. He was a central figure in the disputes between the colonists of Virginia and the later settling of Maryland, partly because of his earlier trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay, which provoked the first naval military battles in North American waters. Claiborne repeatedly attempted and failed to regain Kent Island from the Maryland Calverts, sometimes by force of arms, after its inclusion in the lands that were granted by a 1632 Royal Charter to the Calvert family (to Sir George Calvert, first Baron and Lord Baltimore, (1579-1632), by the reigning King of England, Charles I, (1600–1649, reigned 1625 to execution, 1649), thus becoming Maryland territory. A Puritan, William Claiborne, sided with Parliament, during the English Civil War, of 1642–1651 and was appointed to a commission charged with subduing and managing the, British colonies of, the Province of Virginia and Province of Maryland. He played a role in the submission of Virginia to parliamentary rule in this period. Following the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, he retired from involvement in the politics of the Virginia colony. He died around 1677 at his plantation, \"Romancoke\", on Virginia's Pamunkey River. According to historian Robert Brenner, \"William Claiborne may have been the most consistently influential politician in Virginia throughout the whole of the pre-Restoration period\".",

T'Vault led a wagon train of 300 that arrived in Oregon in 1845, after traveling on the Meek Cutoff, a branch of the Oregon Trail. He settled in Oregon City, and was appointed Postmaster General by the Provisional Government of Oregon. T'Vault became president of the Oregon Printing Association, which was an outgrowth of the Oregon Lyceum, and published the first issue of the Oregon Spectator on February 5, 1846. He was fired from the Spectator after 13 issues. T'Vault claimed it was because of differences with other association members, especially George Abernethy, though the association claimed it because of T'Vault's poor spelling. T'Vault was a pro-slavery Democrat who became a member of the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1846. The same year he was part of a group that urged the United States Congress to disallow the land claims of earlier White residents of the region, including that of John McLoughlin at Willamette Falls. The petition was partially successful and McLoughlin's claim was not recognized. In 1851, T'Vault led an exploring party of ten people from Port Orford in order to seek an overland route to the interior of the region. The party was ambushed by Native Americans and five members were killed, but T'Vault survived. He moved to southern Oregon and established the Table Rock Sentinel newspaper in 1855, and later the Oregon Sentinel in 1858. T'Vault represented Jackson County in the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1858, its final year, and served as speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives during its first session, in 1858-59. He advocated for the formation of an independent Pacific Republic and also practiced law in Jacksonville.",

Il était cultivateur par carrière. Le fils de Leo R. MacDonald et de Helen MacDonald, MacDonald fut éduqué à Orwell. Il a épousé Pauline Murphy le 4 août 1958 et ils eurent neuf enfants. Il représenta la circonscription de Cardigan, qu'il gagna à l'élection fédérale de 1979. Après avoir siégé pour son seul terme, la 31e législature du Canada, il fut défait à l'Élection fédérale canadienne de 1980 par Daniel Joseph MacDonald du parti libéral. Il fut ensuite élu à l'Assemblée législative de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard comme membre de l'Assemblée pour 4e Queens dans l'élection de 1982 et y resta jusqu'en 1989. MacDonald fut ministre de l'industrie de 1984 à 1986. Quand les circonscriptions provinciales furent redistribués en 1996, il devint le membre de Vernon River-Stratford, qu'il a gardé jusqu'à sa retraite de la politique en 2007. MacDonald fut le Président de l'Assemblée législative de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard de 1997 à 2000. MacDonald a essayé par deux fois de retourner à la politique fédérale, la première à une élection partielle du 13 avril 1981 et la deuxième à l'Élection fédérale canadienne de 1993.",

In 1913, Huerta led a counter-revolutionary coup, the Ten Tragic Days, in which Madero was deposed and then assassinated. The Huerta regime was immediately opposed by revolutionary forces, and Huerta was forced to resign and flee the country in 1914, after 17 months as president. While attempting to intrigue with German spies in the United States during World War I, Huerta was arrested in 1915 and died in U.S. custody. Huerta's supporters were known as Huertistas during the Mexican Revolution. Huerta is still vilified by modern-day Mexicans, who generally refer to him as El Chacal (\"The Jackal\") or El Usurpador (\"The Usurper\").",

  "text" : "Pertti Olavi \"Veltto\" Virtanen (born 18 May 1951 in Hämeenlinna) is a rock personality, former presidential candidate, and former member of the Finnish Parliament from Tampere, Finland. In music he performed both as a solo artist and in the bands Virtanen (with Moog Konttinen), Välikausitakki and Sammas. Elektroninen xstaasi is considered the most famous of Veltto Virtanen's songs. Välikausitakki was notable for including also Mikko Alatalo, Harri Rinne and later also Juice Leskinen. After running as an avowed spoiler in the 1994 presidential election, his surprisingly respectable popular vote spurred him to run in the 1995 election for the house of representatives as an essentially independent candidate, and indeed managed to get in. His terms in the Parliament were characteristically quixotic; the speeches he made being exercises in near-shamanistic eloqution, and counter to parliamentary protocol refusing to bare his head, sporting various headgear, but being most famous for his \"artistic\" beret. Although mostly a picturesque spice to the daily routines of the institution, he enjoyed considerable respect from many colleagues in the house. The negligible party KiPu which tactically allied themselves to Veltto, never gained a member of its own, with or without his help; and thus he formed a one-man party-group in the house. Outside critics of the phenomenon of his political success wrote a muckraking book Huijari - Veltto Virtanen & Kirjava Puolue (publisher: Veitikka Kustannus 1999). He continued in elective politics by running in the 1999 and 2003 parliamentary elections with prodigious electoral votes, but failing to enter the house due to the punitive nature for minor parties of the Finnish D'Hondt method of voting. Virtanen became again a member of Parliament in parliamentary elections of 2007, this time representing the True Finns party. He served two terms but did not run as candidate anymore in the parliamentary elections of 2015 Besides his musical and political career, he has also worked as a motivational speaker, most notably for some winter sports teams. Currently he is a member of the Finnish Parliament and municipal council of Tampere. In Mayday 2011 the newly elected member of the parliament delivered a somewhat controversial political Mayday speech, where he stated that if the Swedish People's Party were to become part of the next cabinet with the True Finns, he would resign from the party and vomit for five days. - Jos perussuomalaiset lähtevät samaan hallitukseen RKP:n kanssa, eroan puolueesta ja oksennan viisi päivää.",

As president of the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) during this important period of transition, he worked closely with Alliance Party leader Tunku Abdul Rahman and they developed a close personal bond. He is credited with three important developments in Malaysian political history: the consolidation of the Malayan (now Malaysian) Indian Congress, its transformation into a mass-based party, and its integral role as a partner in the current ruling alliance. The entry of the MIC into the multi-communal Alliance in 1955 contributed greatly to enhancing the coalition's image as the main representative of the three main communities in Malaya. The finest hour was achieved on 31 August 1957 when Independence was achieved under the Merdeka Agreement, to which Sambanthan was a signatory.",

Während der zweiten Militärdiktatur unter Jerry Rawlings war Damuah Mitglied der provisorischen Regierung des Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC). Damuah war Gründer der Afrikania Mission, einer religiösen nationalen Bewegung mit starken politischen Prinzipien und Zielen. Die Gründung der Afrikania Mission soll im Dezember 1982 stattgefunden haben. Andere Quellen nennen den katholischen Priester Osofo Okomfo Damuah als Gründer der Afrikania Mission im Jahr 1985. Hierbei handelt es sich vermutlich um die gleiche Person.

The downsizing of Delta Hospital in her riding by Fraser Health was a significant factor in the 2003 recall campaign against Roddick. After appearing to surpass the required 40 per cent of signatures, the recall petition was submitted to Elections BC which ruled the petition was unsuccessful due to disqualification of more than 3,100 signatures, mostly by ineligible voters. On June 5, 2008, she announced that she would not seek re-election in the 2009 provincial election. Her family established a farm fertilizer business in 1971.",

He quelled several major rebellions and served in important positions in the Qing imperial court, including the Viceroy of Zhili Province. Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonized the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favor with the Chinese after their loss in the 1894 Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military mistakes and praise on the other for his success against the Taiping Rebellion, his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China's industrial and military modernization. He was presented the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria.",

  "text" : "The Honourable Lynda Maureen Haverstock, CM, SOM (born September 16, 1948) is the former leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, and served as the 19th Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan from 2000 until July 2006. In 2007, she was named President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan. Born Lynda Maureen Ham and raised in Swift Current, Haverstock left high school after grade 10 to raise her infant daughter. As an adult, she returned to school to finish her education, and ultimately earned bachelor's and master's degrees in education, as well as a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Saskatchewan. Haverstock rose to the forefront of the provincial Liberals in 1989 and was the first woman in Saskatchewan's history to lead a political party. She brought the Liberals to realize a healthy increase in support, taking over 23 per cent of the vote in the 1991 provincial election. However, their numbers were spread too thinly across the province to translate into seats. Haverstock was the only Liberal to win a seat, in Saskatoon Greystone. Under her leadership, the party grew significantly: in the 1995 provincial election, it increased its caucus in the Legislative Assembly to eleven, becoming the Official Opposition. The Liberals captured one-third of the popular vote. Faced with of a coalition of Regina Liberals and former Tories who had unsuccessfully challenged her leadership, Haverstock resigned as leader in 1995. She spent the remainder of her legislative term as an independent member. In 1999, she retired from politics. The Liberal Party continued to be divided by internal fighting and several members of the Legislative Assembly, including those who had opposed Haverstock, left in 1997 to join the Saskatchewan Party. The 1999 provincial election reduced the Liberals to three seats in the legislature. Since 2003, they have failed to elect any members. After leaving politics, Haverstock worked briefly as a radio host before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan in 2000. As the Queen's representative, she was instrumental in organizing the province's centennial celebrations in 2005. Haverstock's term in office was extended and she remained Lieutenant Governor until July 31, 2006. During her tenure, she granted patronage to over one-hundred community-based organisations. Dr. Lynda Haverstock is a member of the Order of Canada and the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and has honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Regina, Royal Roads University (Victoria), and Queen's University (Kingston). She is a recipient of the Distinguished Canadian Award and is named among the University of Saskatchewan's 100 Alumni of Influence. In June 2007, she became President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan, an arms-length, industry-driven authority responsible, in part, for marketing Saskatchewan as a destination. She has been successful in raising the profile of the organization and broadening awareness of Saskatchewan's tourism sector. Under her direction, the province's first Summit on Tourism was held in September 2007; six President's Task Teams were formed to provide guidance on key challenges and issues; a Quality Assurance Program for the sector was introduced; and the first Tourism Advocacy Day at the provincial legislature was held in November 2011. Between 2006 and 2010, the province's tourism revenues rose from $1.44 billion to $1.68 billion, and increase of 13.5 per cent. Dr. Haverstock sits on the Board of Directors for Shaw Communications. She and her husband Harley Olsen (former CEO of the Office of the Provincial Capital Commission and former Deputy Minister of Municipal Affairs) have four children and nine grandchildren. Her brother Dennis Ham sat as a Conservative in the Saskatchewan assembly.",

They would later have six children. He passed the Arizona Bar exam in 1922, and was admitted to the bar, without having earned a law degree (a common practice in those days). Later that year he succeeded his father as stake president of the St. Johns Stake, a position he held until 1945. In 1922, he lost a bid to be elected as clerk to the Arizona Superior Court. He was defeated by his older brother John Hunt Udall. In 1946 he was elected to the Arizona Supreme Court, and remained a Justice of that court from 1947 until his death. In 1948 Udall wrote the majority opinion of the Arizona State Supreme Court granting Native Americans living on reservations the right to vote. From 1951-1952 and 1957-1958 he served as the Chief Justice of that court. In 1960 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Arizona. He died on May 30 of that year.",

Zo introduceerde hij in 2000 een verordening die het gebruik van natuurlijke anticonceptie, zoals onthouding, aanmoedigde en het gebruik van anticonceptiemiddelen zoals de pil, condooms en steralisatie ontmoedigde. Publieke gezondheidsinstanties krijgen sinds die tijd geen subsidie meer voor dergelijke anticeptie middelen. In 2008 werd door een twintigtal arme vrouwen een rechtszaak aangespannen om deze verordening die ook onder zijn opvolger Alfredo Lim nog in werking was, aan te vechten.",

Larry Campbell began his career in the army and was honorably discharged as a Sergeant First Class. Campbell served as the Republic leader from 1982-1990. Campbell is credited with engineering his party's 1990 takeover of the state legislature, which lasted 16 years. He began working as a lobbyist in 1995, immediately after the end of his legislative term. He was criticized for pre-filing a bill that benefitted a client, with whom he had signed a contract while still a legislator. In 1999, he was considered the most powerful man in Salem. He started the Oregon Victory PAC, which quickly became the biggest lobbying group in the state outside the major parties; it contributed over $750,000 to Oregon politicians in the 1990s. He drew criticism for campaigning on behalf of Republican control of the legislature during the 2007 legislative session.",

He entered provincial politics in the 2006 election, defeating Liberal leader Francis MacKenzie in the Bedford riding. In June 2006, Goucher was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Tourism, Culture and Heritage. In October 2007, Goucher was shuffled to Minister of Immigration. In January 2009, Goucher was given two additional roles in cabinet, becoming Minister of the Public Service Commission, and Minister of Seniors. In the 2009 election, Goucher was defeated by Liberal Kelly Regan. In February 2010, he became embroiled in a spending scandal involving inappropriate expenses charged to the public by a number of Nova Scotia MLAs. Goucher was singled out by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation when they highlighted Nova Scotian politicians for their \"outrageous\" expense claims, naming him the all-star of the scandal and giving him the nickname Len \"the master of multi-tasking\" Goucher. On February 14, 2011 the RCMP released its long awaited investigation results and Goucher was cleared of any wrongdoing.",

He had a column that appeared daily on the back page of the Dispatch called \"Cabbages and Kings,\" a reference to Lewis Carroll's poem, \"The Walrus and the Carpenter.\" He commonly wrote under the pen name \"Larry Ho.\" The name came about when he had written his first feature article for the Times. He was signing his name, \"Larry Hodgson,\" but his pencil broke after the first \"o.\" The city editor, James Gray, reportedly said, \"Better let it go at that–'Larry Ho.'\" He served as secretary to both St. Paul mayors Winn Powers and Vivian R. Irvin, and upon the expiration of Irvin's term, he was elected mayor by a large majority. He served two non-consecutive terms as mayor from 1918 to 1922, and from 1926 to 1930. Hodgson also ran for governor in 1920, but came third in the race, garnering only 81,293 votes. After Hodgson's death in 1937, his son, Laurence K.

  "text" : "Charles Wendell \"Chuck\" Colson (October 16, 1931 – April 21, 2012) was an Evangelical Christian leader who founded Prison Fellowship and BreakPoint. Prior to his conversion to Christianity, he served as Special Counsel to President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1973. Once known as President Nixon's \"hatchet man,\" Colson gained notoriety at the height of the Watergate scandal, for being named as one of the Watergate Seven, and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for attempting to defame Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg. In 1974, he served seven months in the federal Maxwell Prison in Alabama as the first member of the Nixon administration to be incarcerated for Watergate-related charges. Colson became a Christian in 1973. His mid-life conversion to Christianity sparked a radical life change that led to the founding of his non-profit ministry Prison Fellowship and to a focus on Christian worldview teaching and training. Colson was also a public speaker and the author of more than 30 books. He was the founder and chairman of The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which is \"a research, study, and networking center for growing in a Christian worldview\", and while he was alive included Colson's daily radio commentary, BreakPoint, which was heard in its original format on more than 1,400 outlets across the United States. Colson was a principal signer of the 1994 Evangelicals and Catholics Together ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholic leaders in the United States. Colson received 15 honorary doctorates, and in 1993 was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the world's largest annual award (over US$1 million) in the field of religion, given to a person who \"has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension\". He donated this prize to further the work of Prison Fellowship, as he did all his speaking fees and royalties. In 2008, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush.",

  "text" : "(This article is about the Sinn Féin politician. For the American ice hockey player, see Connor Murphy.) Conor Terence Murphy (born 10 July 1963) is an Irish republican Sinn Féin politician who is the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland for Newry and Armagh. He served as the Member of Parliament for Newry and Armagh from 2005-2015. Murphy was born in Camlough, South Armagh and joined the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the 1981 hunger strikes. In 1982 he was sentenced to five years in prison for IRA membership and possession of explosives. Between 1989 and 1997, he was a Sinn Féin councillor on Newry and Mourne District Council for The Fews area, in South Armagh and South Down, and served as his party's group leader at that level. In 1998, Murphy was elected as one of his party's two Northern Ireland Assembly members for Newry and Armagh. He was re-elected, with two party colleagues, to the Assembly in 2003. He lives in Camlough, County Armagh with his wife Catherine, his daughter Áine and his son Oisín. He attended St Colman's College, Newry, Queen's University of Belfast (QUB), and the University of Ulster. In 2001, he contested the Newry and Armagh Westminster seat, coming second to incumbent Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). When Mallon decided not to contest the seat again, Murphy became the clear favourite to win and was elected on 5 May 2005. He refused to take his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in line with the abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin. In the Northern Ireland Assembly, he served as the Minister for Regional Development in the Northern Ireland Executive from 8 May 2007 until 16 May 2011. While on a tour of UK party conferences in autumn 2005, he became the first Irish republican to address the Conservative Party conference and caused controversy by refusing to express regret over the Brighton hotel bombing. In 2011, while Minister for Regional Development, Murphy appointed Sean Hogan, a Catholic, as head of Northern Ireland Water, turning down the applications of four Protestants on the shortlist. A tribunal subsequently awarded £150,000 damages for discrimination to one of these applicants, Alan Lennon, judging that Hogan was appointed because \"he was not from a Protestant background and because he was known to the minister and his (then Sinn Fein) ministerial colleagues Michelle Gildernew and Caitriona Ruane, who were consulted about the appointment.\" The tribunal found Murphy's evidence was \"implausible and lack[ing] credibility\", and that, during Murphy's tenure at the Department for Regional Development, there was a \"material bias against the appointment of candidates from a Protestant background\". Murphy disputed the finding which he said branded him \"sectarian\". Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness defended him, claiming Murphy doesn't have \"a sectarian bone in his body\". In December 2012, Murphy appeared as a witness at Belfast High Court in the case of Declan Gormley, whom Murphy had sacked in 2010 from his post as a non-executive director of NI Water. Gormley sued Sinn Féin over two press releases which he argued were defamatory. Gormley was subsequently offered £80,000 in damages.",

He was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Carmen Provenzano was a graduate of St. Mary's College in the Sault. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Windsor, and a law degree (LLB) from Queen's University in Kingston. On graduation, he started his legal career in the city of Sault Ste. Marie's legal department, and for 25 years was self-employed in legal private practice in the Sault, specializing in municipal and planning law. He served as a charter member of the Algoma District Health Council, and for 13 consecutive years as a trustee on the Sault Ste. Marie Board of Education, where he served on all committees, including finance (chair) and salary negotiation. Provenzano was the past chair of the Northern Ontario Liberal caucus. After his election to Parliament in 1997 and re-election in 2000, he served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, and was on several standing committees of the House of Commons, including fisheries and oceans (vice-chair), government operations and natural resources (vice-chair), and national defence and veterans affairs. He was also a member of the parliamentary steel caucus. As the Sault's MP, he considered his involvement in the successful restructuring of Algoma Steel a significant personal achievement. He was married to his wife Ada for nearly forty years, and together they had four children. Provenzano died from a sudden heart attack on July 27, 2005. His nephew Christian Provenzano ran unsuccessfully for the Liberals in his former riding during the 2006 federal election and the 2011 federal election, and was elected mayor of Sault Ste.

  "text" : "Charlotte Anne Laws (born May 11, 1960) is an American author, talk show host, community activist, animal rights advocate, anti-revenge porn activist, former Los Angeles politician, and actress under the stage name Missy Laws. Laws was a weekly commentator on the television show The Filter with Fred Roggin from August 2009 until 2013 when the show went off the air. One of her episodes was nominated for an Emmy. Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet.",

After serving as an independent member of the Chamber of Deputies for one mandate (1899-1903), he aligned his views with those of Take Ionescu, and became a supporter of Romania's entry into World War I alongside the Entente Powers.

Bishop held portfolios in the outer ministry during the first two terms of the Howard Government, serving as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel from 1996 to 1998 and as Minister for Aged Care from 1998 to 2001. In October 2014, she surpassed Kathy Sullivan's record for the longest period of parliamentary service by a woman. From July 2015, Bishop was subject to sustained intense media and public scrutiny regarding her use of parliamentary entitlements, including a helicopter charter to a party fundraiser during her time as speaker. Although Prime Minister Tony Abbott had originally been one of her strongest allies, she eventually lost his support, resigning from the speakership and moving to the backbench on 2 August to be replaced as speaker by Tony Smith. On 16 April 2016, Bishop was defeated by Jason Falinski in a Liberal Party preselection ballot (51 votes to 39) for the Division of Mackellar at the 2016 federal election.",

  "text" : "Buckner Stith Morris (August 19, 1800 – December 16, 1879) served as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1838–1839) for the Whig Party. Morris married Evelina Barker in Kentucky in 1832 and the couple moved to Chicago in 1834 where Morris established a law practice with J. Young Scammon and created the Chicago Lyceum, the city's first literary society. By 1835, however, Morris had left Scammon and was practicing law with Edward Casey. He was elected mayor of Chicago in 1838 and went on to serve terms as a city alderman. He ran for the office of Illinois Secretary of State in 1852 under the Whig ticket and served as a Lake County Circuit Court Judge from 1853-1855. Following Evelina's death in 1847, he married Eliza Stephenson in 1850. Eliza died in 1855. The former mayor was outspoken in his opposition the American Civil War and was suspected to sympathise with the \"Copperheads.\" In 1864, he was arrested for aiding in a Confederate attempt to free prisoners of war from Camp Douglas. He was held for 9 months, but was then exonerated by a military court. Being unable, while so detained, to attend to his business affairs, he lost most of his assets through foreclosures. Incensed over the treatment of their ancestor, his heirs refused to permit the donation of his historical material, diaries, etc., to the Chicago Historical Society, despite urging to that end. The first use recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary of the phrase, to hell in a hand basket, is in The Great North-Western Conspiracy in All Its Startling Details, by I. Windslow Ayer, in alleging that, at a meeting of the Order of the Sons of Liberty, Judge Morris of the Circuit Court of Illinois said: \"Thousands of our best men were prisoners in Camp Douglas, and if once at liberty would 'send abolitionists to hell in a hand basket.'\"",

  "text" : "Brenda Kay Chamberlain, PC (born April 9, 1952 in Toronto, Ontario) was a member of the Canadian House of Commons, representing the riding of Guelph for the Liberal Party from 1993 until her resignation as of April, 2008. Chamberlain was a home daycare owner and operator from 1979 to 1983, and served as the administrative assistant in a family-owned business from 1984 to 1987. She also served as Executive Director of the Wellington County Literacy Council from 1989 to 1993, and of the Guelph-Wellington Career Educational Council from 1992 to 1993. During this time she also served on the Wellington County Board of Education (1985–1993). Chamberlain sought the federal Liberal nomination in Guelph-Wellington in 1992. Chamberlain's main challenger for the nomination was to be former Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Maine, who represented Guelph in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979. Maine dropped out of the race after the riding's nomination meeting was scheduled for an early date, arguing that this favoured Chamberlain. Chamberlain went on to win the Liberal nomination by acclamation. Maine later decided to run as an independent candidate against Chamberlain in the 1993 federal election. Chamberlain was elected handily as the Liberals took all but one of Ontario's 101 seats—the closest any party has come to sweeping the country's biggest province at the federal level. Chamberlain was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1997 and 2000. For many years, she was known as a strong supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party. Chamberlain won another easy victory in the election of 2004, defeating her Conservative opponent by nearly 10,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Guelph. Chamberlain was elected a fifth time in the election of 2006, in which the Conservative Party won a national minority government. She was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and was a vocal opponent of her own party's plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Chamberlain also voted against her party's same-sex marriage bill in 2005. She was also involved in legislation which forced Bell Canada to revise its 411 billing policy. Chamberlain served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour from 1997 to 1999, and was parliamentary secretary to the president of the Queen's Privy Council, with special emphasis on public service reform and Métis and Non-Status Indians, from December 2003 to July 2004. Although opposition spread rumours that she was about to retire she stood for re-election in 2006 and won handily. Just over two years later, on March 7, 2008, Chamberlain announced her resignation from the House of Commons effective April 7. She did not provide a reason for her resignation. During that election and thereafter the Guelph Mercury subjected Chamberlain to increasing degrees of criticism. Hansard will show that Chamberlain's last official votes occurred during the finals of weeks of February 2008. Subsequently, in a 2008 by-election Liberal candidate Frank Valeriote was elected in the Guelph riding. Brenda Chamberlain served locally as a school trustee and federally as a Member of the House of Commons. She was elected for twenty-four consecutive years of public service.",

As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes.",

  "text" : "Bert Hazell (* 18. April 1907 in Attleborough, Norfolk; † 11. Januar 2009 in York), auch Bertie Hazell genannt, war ein britischer Gewerkschaftsführer und Politiker der Labour Party. Hazell wurde 1907 in Attleborough in Norfolk als Sohn eines Landarbeiters geboren. Im Alter von 14 Jahren brach er die Schule ab, um in der Park Farm, einem landwirtschaftlichen Betrieb in Wymondham, zu arbeiten. Zu seinen Aufgaben dort zählte unter anderem das Aufschrecken von Krähen. In seiner Zeit als Abgeordneter sollte Hazell noch oft in Bezug auf seine Tätigkeit im Parlament darauf anspielen. Aufgrund der schlechten Bedingungen für die Landarbeiter und ihre Familien, die sich im Zuge des Ersten Weltkrieges noch weiter verschlechtert hatten und zum Norfolk Landarbeiterstreik von 1923 führten, begann sich Hazell in der National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers zu engagieren. Als 1933 die Park Farm ihren Besitzer wechselte, wurde Hazell daraufhin wegen seines Engagements entlassen. Hazell wurde nun für die Labour Party in Norfolk tätig. In den Jahren 1945 und 1950 kandidierte für die Partei erfolglos für einen Sitz im Unterhaus. Erst Oktober 1964 geland es ihm in Unterhaus gewählt zu werden, dem er bis 1970 als Abgeordneter für den Wahlbezirk „North Norfolk“ angehörte. Im Unterhaus war Hazell 1965 der erste Abgeordnete, der das Problem der Küstenerosion ansprach. 1984 wurde ihm an der University of York der Ehrendoktortitel verliehen. Seit dem Tod von David Renton, Baron Renton Mai 2007 war Hazell der älteste noch lebende ehemalige Parlamentarier des Vereinigten Königreiches. Hazell war seit 1936 mit Dora Barham († 1987) verheiratet und hatte eine Tochter. Im Jahr 1946 wurde er Member (MBE) des Order of the British Empire, 1962 dann Commander (CBE).",

During his six-year tenure he attracted nearly $750 million of economic development to Clearwater including a sweeping redevelopment of the city's number-one economic engine, Clearwater Beach. Mayor Aungst served on Pinellas County's Tourist Development Council, the advisory board of Pinellas County's Convention and Visitors Bureau, using his position as mayor to encourage tourists to visit the area, especially after the events of 9/11/2001. Aungst was instrumental in putting together a public-private partnership to build a new Community Sports Complex Bright House Networks Field to host Philadelphia Phillies Spring Training Baseball and their minor league team the Clearwater Threshers and other community events. In addition he spearheaded a public-private partnership to build a new 90,000-square-foot (8,400 m2) signature public library in downtown Clearwater. Under his leadership the city built multiple community recreation centers and athletic complexes and was named Sports Illustrated magazine's \"Sports Town USA\" for the state of Florida. He was the first Mayor of Clearwater, Florida to be re-elected unopposed since 1956. Aungst supported his successor Mayor Frank Hibbard who was elected unopposed to replace him in 2005 and re-elected in 2008. Brian Aungst presided over the Clearwater City Commission for almost six years of unprecedented growth.",

Born in 1901, the son of a Lisburn solicitor, he was educated at The Wallace High School and Trinity College Dublin from where he graduated with a Law degree (LLD), and was called to the Northern Ireland bar in 1923. Having served in the Royal Corps of Artillery during the Second World War he entered the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1938 when he won the Lisburn-centered seat of Iveagh. He entered the Cabinet of Basil Brooke in 1945 when he became Minister of Labour. His stints as the Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Finance (de facto Deputy Prime Minister) left him favorite to succeed Brooke as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. In the early 1950s however, Maginess became a hate figure for the Orange Order when he banned marches through Catholic areas in Counties Down and Londonderry. Brooke demoted him to the non-Cabinet post of Attorney General in April 1956. While Attorney General, Maginess was party to the case of Attorney General for Northern Ireland v Gallagher [1961] 3 All Er 299, which remains authority in the law of Northern Ireland and England & Wales for the principle that Dutch courage is not a defence in criminal law. Counsel for Gallagher were future Attorney General and Lord Justice, Basil Kelly, and future Stormont MP and Chairman of the Criminal Bar Association in England, Richard Ferguson. In December 1959, Ian Paisley led a demonstration of Ulster Protestant Action members to Stormont Castle to protest at Brooke's refusal to dismiss Maginess and Sir Clarence Graham for making speeches at an Ulster Young Unionist Council event supporting Catholic membership of the Ulster Unionist Party. Having been appointed a King's Counsel in 1946 he was appointed a County Court Judge in 1964 when he resigned from Parliament. He died three years later in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital at age 65. A plaque in his memorial is cited inside the Church of Ireland parish church in Hillsborough, where he is buried.",

  "text" : "Boonsanong Punyodyana (Thai: บุญสนอง บุณโยทยาน; rtgs: Bunsanong Bunyothayan) was a Thai politician and General secretary of the Socialist Party of Thailand. He was assassinated on February 28, 1976. After graduating from Chulalongkorn University in 1959, he worked for the Thai government, preparing English translations of official manuals. His skill in English and his familiarity with the Thai governmental structure gained him employment with the United States Information Service in Bangkok as a writer and researcher. In 1962, he won a Fulbright-Hayes Scholarship to study for the master's degree in sociology at the University of Kansas. At that point, one would not have predicted that he would one day lead student demonstrators to rip the brazen eagle from the gate of the U.S. Embassy on Wireless Road, as he did following the Mayaguez incident. After receiving the M.A., Boonsanong returned to Thailand where he joined the staff of Thammasat University as a lecturer in sociology. In 1967 he returned to the U.S. and spent five extremely productive years there. He completed a Ph.D. in sociology at Cornell University, published several articles, spent a year at Harvard University and another year as Visiting Professor at the University of Hawai'i. By the time of his return to Thailand in 1972, he had established himself as an internationally recognized scholar in his field. It was a record that few of his colleagues in Thailand could equal, including those who were many years his senior. Back at Thammasat University in June 1972, he immediately became one of the university's leading activists. This was a time of general intellectual ferment. Boonsanong was in his element, writing papers, attending meetings, carrying out research, organizing and lecturing to hundreds of rapt and enthusiastic young people. The student movement which was to overthrow the military dictatorship was beginning and Thammasat was its epicenter. Dr. Boonsanong Punyodyana fell to an assassin's bullet at about 1:30 a.m. on 28 February 1976. At the time of his death, he was the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party of Thailand. There is little doubt that his death was politically motivated. Since few among Thailand's ruling elite regretted his passing, not many expect his murderers to be apprehended. He will be sorely missed however, by his wife and two daughters, by his academic colleagues, and by the Thai people.",

In 1991, according to biographical details issued at a 2007 U.S. Institute of Peace briefing, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Defence for Operations. The biographical details said that he 'was responsible for reestablishing civilian control over the Liberian army and established an urban response team to counter urban terrorism.' He served in this position until 1994. In 1993-94, he served as commander of the 'Black Berets,' a paramilitary police force in the Monrovia enclave of Amos Sawyer's Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU). The International Crisis Group also notes that the Black Berets also fought alongside ECOMOG at times, notably during Charles Taylor's 1992 assault on Monrovia ('Operation Octopus'). 'They and the AFL were accused of killing some 600 civilians in the June 1993 Camp Carter massacre, which, testimony at the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission has indicated, was perpetuated by Taylor's NPFL fighters, who may have orchestrated it to put blame on the Armed Forces of Liberia.' He served as Director of the Liberian National Police from 1994–95 and Deputy Minister of State for Administration from 1995 to 1997. In 1998 he served on the AFL Restructuring Commission, where he was listed as a retired Colonel of the AFL in private business. From 1999 to c.2004/05 he served as a security officer with the United Nations, initially with UNTAET in East Timor, and then from 2000 with UNHCR and the UN Department of Safety and Security in Tanzania.

He took office following the resignation of John V. Kenny. Berry achieved a level of notoriety for having banned both rock and roll music as well as an \"obscene\" film from Jersey City during his tenure. Berry banned the film The Moon Is Blue from being shown for being \"indecent and obscene\" and refused to allow Bill Haley and the Comets to play a concert at municipally-owned Roosevelt Stadium. The latter act is believed to have inspired Haley to write the first protest song in rock and roll, \"Teenager's Mother,\" which included the lyrics \"Are you right? Did you forget too soon? How much you liked to do the Charleston?\" In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the US immigration station, Berry commandeered a US Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim Ellis Island.",

  "text" : "Takako Doi (土井 たか子 Doi Takako, November 30, 1928 – September 20, 2014) was a prominent Japanese politician from 1980 until her retirement in 2005. She was the first female Lower House Speaker in Japan, the highest position a female politician has ever held in the country's modern history (a rank akin to Nancy Pelosi). Doi was born in Hyōgo Prefecture and graduated from Doshisha University, where she studied law. She was elected to the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Diet, as a member of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) in 1969, representing the 2nd district of Hyōgo. She spent her first ten years in the House on the sidelines, but came to national attention in 1980 when she was highly critical of Japan's unequal treatment of women, specifically about women-only home economics degrees and the father-dominated family registration law. She pressured the Diet to sign the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1985. Doi became Vice Chair of the JSP in 1984 and the first female leader of a political party division in Japanese history in 1986, as chair of the JSP Central Policy Division. The JSP took a record high number of seats in 1990, when it won 136 seats in the House of Representatives, partly because of Doi's popularity, but she resigned her party post in 1991, in the wake of the Gulf War. In 1994, no party held a majority in the House and the JSP took the lead in forming a coalition government. The JSP's president, Tomiichi Murayama, became Prime Minister. However, the coalition collapsed in 1996 and, following a disastrous electoral defeat for the JSP later that year, Doi returned to lead the party.",

  "text" : "Tagak Curley (born 1944) is an Inuit leader, politician and businessman from Nunavut. As a prominent figure in the negotiations that led to the creation of Nunavut, Tagak is considered a living father of confederation in Canada. He was born in a hunting camp at Coral Harbour, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut). From 1966 to 1970, he worked as a development officer with the federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Based on his experiences, Curley became politically active and took on leadership roles at the local level to promote better living conditions for Inuit in local communities across Nunavut. From 1970-71, Curley served as the Repulse Bay settlement manager. He also acted as editor of the Keewatin Echo, the first English-Inuktitut newspaper in Canada. He was a founding member and the first president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (Inuit Tapirisat of Canada) in 1971. ITK was formed to represent Nunavut Inuit by their own organization. Curley held leadership positions with the Inuit Cultural Institute, the group that first initiated the process to recognize Nunavut as a formal territory in Canada, as well as Nunasi Corporation, an Inuit economic development organization, and in Nunavut Construction. At the territorial level, Curley served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1979 to 1987; at the time, Nunavut was under the Northwest Territories. While in government, he held several cabinet posts, including the minister of economic development, minister of Mines and Resources Secretariat, and minister of public utilities from 1984 to 1987, and minister of government services in 1986-87. He ran as a federal Liberal candidate in the 1979 election for the Nunatsiaq (now Nunavut) riding, coming in second to Peter Ittinuar. In the years following the passage of the Nunavut Act, Curley acted as business manager for Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), the organization responsible for representing the Nunavut Inuit under the Nunavut land claim agreement. In 1998, Curley was awarded the Aboriginal Lifetime Achievement award for his contribution and leadership in business. In October 2003, Curley received the Order of Canada. In the 2004 Nunavut general election, Curley was acclaimed for the Nunavut riding of Rankin Inlet North. He re-entered politics to improve local government for his people and community. After the election, Curley challenged Paul Okalik for premiership of Nunavut, but was not elected by the Legislative Assembly. He later called for Okalik to resign as premier after Okalik made derogatory remarks about a senior municipal government official from Iqaluit to that city's mayor, Elisapee Sheutiapik. In 2008, he appeared in the documentary Passage, challenging 19th century claims by Lady Franklin, widely believed at the time, that the Inuit were responsible for signs of cannibalism among her husband's doomed expedition through the Northwest Passage.",

  "text" : "Thomas P. Gaffey is an American politician. Gaffey, a Democrat, had been a state senator from Connecticut since 1995, but left office due to criminal violations on January 5, 2011. Gaffey, a resident of Meriden, has represented the towns of Cheshire, Meriden, Middlefield and Middletown in the Connecticut Senate. Gaffey was born in Meriden and graduated from Southern Connecticut State University. He was appointed in the fall of 2005 to serve as Chief Deputy Majority Leader by Senate Majority Leader Martin Looney and Senate President Pro Tempore Donald E. Williams, Jr., and previously served in the position. Gaffey also serves as an executive with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. In 2002, he was linked to meetings with failed energy firm Enron. He was also cited that year for spending over $10,000 in personal expenses on his authority expense account, and failing to make timely reimbursement, but later issued a CRRA check for more than $1,600 to repay amounts reimbursed in excess. In January 2009 the Hartford Courant announced state auditors were looking into other instances of improper reimbursement by Gaffey, including double billing of out of state travel to both the state government and his political action committee. On January 18, the Courant urged the State Senate to censure Gaffey for his ethical improprieties. On May 6, 2009, the State Election Enforcement Commission announced that Gaffey and his campaign treasurer had agreed to a settlement over the double billing complaint. In one of the largest fines levied by the Commission, Gaffey agreed to a $6,000 fine and his treasurer agreed to a $3,000 fine. Gaffey also agreed to dissolve his political action committee and forfeit its $20,000 balance to the state. The commission's enforcement director called Gaffey's record keeping \"disastrous\". The charges later led to a criminal investigation and Gaffey's resignation. In 2006 Gaffey supported legislation spearheaded by fellow Democrat Donald Williams intended to address childhood obesity in Connecticut. The legislation was however derided by opponents as the \"cupcake bill.\" As of August 2008, more than 63% of eligibile school districts have enrolled in the program. In March 2008 New Haven schools enforced this policy by suspending an eighth grader for selling a classmate skittles. In May 2008, a principal in Greenwich was suspended in a dispute over bringing cupcakes to school. In 2007 Gaffey proposed that the Governor's power to appoint the Commissioner of Education be limited. Allies of Governor Jodi Rell labelled the proposal an attempted power grab. That year Gaffey also opposed efforts to increase education aid to suburban school districts, even those represented by fellow Democrats, in favor of adding more funds to urban districts. His response to complaints from suburban legislators was \"Like everything else in those districts, that is rich!\" Gaffey has also clashed with leaders of his local school board over the installation of artificial turf. In November 2007 Gaffey suggested that the state had to impose a more stringent school integration plan on suburbs in the Hartford region. \"The notion that we're going to get a better result by voluntary programs is ridiculous,\" said state Sen. Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden, co-chairman of the legislature's education committee. \"We need to shift away from the model of remedy that the state has been pursuing for years. The district is as racially isolated today as it was 10 years ago. It suggests you need to do something different.\" Another Gaffey initiative was a bill that banned most out-of-school suspensions. Educators were unsure how they could comply with the law. In 2008 Gaffey did break with party leadership to support a Three Strikes Law to give life sentences to career violent criminals supported by Governor M. Jodi Rell. Thomas P. Gaffey was the father of three children. His son, Thomas M. Gaffey died on February 2, 2009, at the age of 16. In 2005 the Connecticut Appellate Court denied the Senator's ex-wife's request for increased child support.",

At the time of his death, his estate was worth US$6 million ($170.7 million today). Blackstone served as president of the Chicago and Alton Railroad from 1864 through 1899, was a founding president of the Union Stock Yards, and served one term as mayor of La Salle, Illinois. An active philanthropist, Blackstone was the benefactor of the James Blackstone Memorial Library in Branford, Connecticut. A nearly identical library, Blackstone Memorial Library, was donated to the Chicago Public Library by Timothy Blackstone's widow in 1902. The Blackstones also funded Blackstone Hall for the Art Institute of Chicago Building. Chicago's Blackstone Library is the first dedicated branch of the Chicago Public Library system, and later his mansion became the site of the Blackstone Hotel and the Blackstone Theatre.",

Taue studierte Jura an der Universität Kyūshū. Nach seiner Graduierung begann er in der Stadtverwaltung von Nagasaki zu arbeiten und war zuerst in den Bereichen Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Tourismus tätig. Als der amtierende Bürgermeister Itchō Itō April 2007 nach einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung kurz vor den einheitlichen Regionalwahlen 2007 von dem Yakuza-Mitglied Tetsuya Shiroo niedergeschossen wurde und infolge seines hohen Blutverlustes starb, entschied sich Taue für das Amt des Bürgermeisters zu kandidieren. Er trat hierbei gegen Makoto Yokoo, den Schwiegersohn Itōs, an. Taue, der nun seine Kandidatur erst fünf Tage vor der Wahl einbrachte, versuchte Yokoos Kandidatur als Nepotismus und Patronage darzustellen. Viel Wähler wiederum empfanden das Festhalten an dem Wahltermin so kurz nach Itōs Tod für taktlos und so kam es dazu, dass einige Wähler Wahlzettel mit Itōs Namen beschrifteten oder protestwählten. Nach einem knappen Ergebnis und mehreren Nachzählungen, wurde Taue mit einem Vorsprung von 953 Stimmen zum Bürgermeister gewählt. Wie schon sein Vorgänger setzt sich auch Taue gegen Atomwaffen ein. Kurz nach seiner Wahl zum Bürgermeister kritisierte er Fumio Kyūma für dessen am 30. Juni 2007 in einer Rede in der Reitaku-Universität bekundeten Äußerungen zum Atombombenabwurf auf Nagasaki. Ebenso kritisierte er den liberaldemokratischen Politiker Taku Yamasaki für dessen Aussagen über nordkoreanische Atomwaffentests, in denen Yamasaki sie als nützlich zur Erkenntnis über die nordkoreanische Atomwaffenkapazität bezeichnet hatte. Yamasaki äußerte sich später dahingehend, das er genauso wie Taue ein Gegner von Atomwaffen ist.",

  "text" : "Athanasios Plevris oder Thanos Plevris (griechisch Αθανάσιος Πλεύρης; * 21. Mai 1977) ist ein griechischer Jurist und Politiker der liberal-konservativen Nea Dimokratia. Plevris ist der Sohn des Holocaustleugners und antisemitischen Vertreters der extremen Rechten Kostas Plevris. Athanasios Plevris hat sich zwar öffentlich von den politischen Ansichten seines Vaters distanziert, ihn aber als Rechtsanwalt gegen den Vorwurf der Volksverhetzung verteidigt und nach dessen Freispruch die „in Griechenland geltende Meinungsfreiheit“ gepriesen. Plevris studierte Rechtswissenschaften an der Universität Athen und wurde im Strafrecht promoviert. Er schloss ein Aufbaustudium in Medizinrecht an der  Universität Heidelberg an. Während seines Aufenthalts dort war er 2002 Vorsitzender des Verbands der griechischen und zypriotischen Studenten. Plevris wurde bei der Parlamentswahl 2007 für die Partei LAOS gewählt. Bei der Europawahl 2009 wurde er als einer von zwei LAOS-Abgeordneten in das Europäische Parlament gewählt: Diesem gehörte er als Mitglied der europakritischen Fraktion Europa der Freiheit und Demokratie (EFD) jedoch nur einige Monate an: Bei den vorgezogenen Wahlen am 4. Oktober 2009 wurde er wieder in das nationale griechische Parlament gewählt. Als Abgeordneter im griechischen Parlament setzte sich Plevris für ein Gesetzesprojekt ein, das den im Ausland lebenden Griechen das Wahlrecht zusprechen würde. In einer Anfrage an den Justizminister hat er seine Empörung gegen die unverblümte Erwähnung des Namens Mazedonien auf den Karten der Partei Ouranio Toxo (Regenbogen, Partei der slawo-mazedonischen Minderheit) und Helsinki Watch ausgedrückt. Seine Frage, ob diese Organisationen sich nicht strafbar gemacht hätten, wurde von den Medien in Mazedonien empört als Forderung der Todesstrafe für die Mitglieder der Partei Regenbogen fehlinterpretiert. Die These der Existenz einer als mazedonisch zu bezeichnenden Sprache wird von Plevris als völlig inakzeptabel betrachtet. Er selbst nennt die in Mazedonien gesprochene Sprache „slawisch“ und stellt die Frage, warum der Staat „Organisationen finanziert, die der pro-skopianischen Propaganda dienen“. Im Mai 2012 wechselte Plevris zur Nea Dimokratia um den pro-europäischen Kurs Griechenlands zu unterstützen. Nach der Berufung von Dimitris Avramopoulos zum EU-Kommissar, rückte Plevris im November 2014 als Abgeordneter für die Nea Dimokratia im griechischen Parlament nach.",

Following his resignation, Jersey City was without a Mayor for 47 days while the city council failed to reach a consensus on a successor. Gangemi became a naturalized citizen on September 2, 1964. He filed petitions to run for Mayor again in 1965, but was refused by the City Clerk and New Jersey Superior Court before being allowed on the ballot (see Gangemi v. Rosengard 207 A.2d 665 (N.J. 1965)).",

  "text" : "Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ruhollah Mūsavi Khomeini (Persian: روح‌الله خمینی‎‎, [ruːholˈlɑːhe χomeiˈniː] , 24 September 1902 – 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader, revolutionary and politician. He was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei. Khomeini was a marja (\"source of emulation\") in Twelver Shia Islam, a Mujtahid or faqih (an expert in Islamic law) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the theory of velayat-e faqih, the \"Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority)\", to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists. This principle (though not known to the wider public before the revolution), was appended to the new Iranian constitution after being put to a referendum. Khomeini called democracy the equivalent of prostitution. He was named Man of the Year in 1979 by American news magazine TIME for his international influence, and has been described as the \"virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\" where he remains a controversial figure. In 1982, Khomeini survived one military coup attempt. Khomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis, his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, and for referring to the United States as the \"Great Satan\". Khomeini has been criticized for these acts and for human rights violations of Iranians (including his ordering of execution of thousands of political prisoners), and the pursuit of victory in the Iran–Iraq War that ultimately proved futile. He has also been lauded as a \"charismatic leader of immense popularity\", a \"champion of Islamic revival\" by Shia scholars, who attempted to establish good relations between Sunnis and Shias, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini held the title of Grand Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. He is generally referred to as Ayatollah Khomeini by others. In Iran, his gold-domed tomb in Tehrān's Behesht-e Zahrāʾ cemetery has become a shrine for his supporters, and he is legally considered \"inviolable\", with Iranians regularly punished for insulting him.",

Daley was Chicago's third consecutive mayor from the working-class, heavily Irish American Bridgeport neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, where he lived his entire life. Daley is remembered for doing much to avoid the declines that some other \"rust belt\" cities like Cleveland, Buffalo and Detroit experienced during the same period. He had a strong base of support in Chicago's Irish Catholic community, and he was treated by national politicians such as Lyndon B. Johnson as a pre-eminent Irish American, with special connections to the Kennedy family. Daley played a major role in the history of the Democratic Party, especially with his support of John F. Kennedy in 1960 and of Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Daley is the father of Richard M. Daley, also a former mayor of Chicago, William M. Daley, a former United States Secretary of Commerce, and John P. Daley, a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. While many members of Daley's administration were charged with corruption and convicted, Daley was never charged with corruption.",

On 10 December 2003, she became the third member of the council not to be reelected in the history of the Swiss Federal State. In the 2003 Federal Assembly elections, her party lost many voters and the Swiss People's Party became the largest party of Switzerland. The Swiss People's party then requested another seat in the Federal Council. In the elections for the Federal Council on 10 December, the Federal Assembly did not re-elect Ruth Metzler and elected Christoph Blocher instead, by 121 votes to 116 on the third round of voting. She challenged her CVP colleague Joseph Deiss for his seat, but lost by 138 to 96. Metzler kept her seat until the end of the year and Christoph Blocher succeeded her on 1 January 2004. She published the memories of those years under the title \"Grissini & Alpenbitter\", 2004, ISBN 3-85882-388-0. She was teaching between February 2004 and July 2004 at the University of St. Gallen a class called \"Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten in der Politik\" which can be translated as \"scope for design in politics\".

  "text" : "Rudolf Jung (16 April 1882 – 11 December 1945) was an instrumental force and agitator of German Bohemian National Socialism and, later on, became a member of the Nazi Party. Rudolf Jung was born in Plasy and went to school in Jihlava, a town fractured by national antagonisms. He was a civil engineer employed by the national railways of the Austro-Hungary. His party work took him from Vienna to Bohemia. In 1909, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP) (later in Czechoslovakia, DNSAP) and became an ardent party agitator. Because of his party provocations, Jung was fired but his party put him on their payroll and he devoted himself to theoretical work. Along with Dr. Walter Riehl, he drafted the Jihlava party program of 1913 \"which contained a more detailed comparison of international Marxism and national socialism and a more pointed attack on Capitalism, Democracy, alien peoples, and Jews. Here, anti-semitism ranked behind anti-Slavism, anti-clericalism and anti-capitalism.\"  In 1919, he completed his theoretical work Der Nationale Sozialismus. Jung expressed the hope in his introduction that his book would play the same role for national socialism that Das Kapital did for Marxian socialism. It is he that convinced Hitler to use the term \"National Socialist\" for the DAP's counterpart in Germany; Hitler originally wanted to rename the German DAP into the \"Social Revolutionary Party\". Some of the posts and honors he held were: President of the State Labour office in area Middle Germany, Gauleiter ad Honorem (honorary), and in 1936, Member of the Reichstag for the district Westfalia South. In 1943, he became the Reich Inspector and Director of the Reich Inspection of Labour Administration. He committed suicide in Prague's Pankrác prison before his trial for Nazi activities. He wrote several books including: Der nationale Sozialismus: seine Grundlagen, sein Werdegang und seine Ziele (National Socialism, its Foundations, Development and Goals), Aussig, 1919. 2nd ed.; Munich: Deutscher Volksverlag Dr. Boepple, 1922.",

He was a politician in the Canadian province of Alberta and former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. He was elected on November 22, 2004 in the 26th Alberta general election in Edmonton Rutherford, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative and former member of the Canadian House of Commons Ian McClelland. Miller served as opposition critic for two portfolios, the Treasury Board and Finance. He was also the chief opposition whip for the Alberta Liberal Party. He was defeated in the 2008 election by Progressive Conservative Fred Horne. In May 2005, Miller involved himself in the controversy surrounding the decision of then Conservative Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberals. After Tony Abbott, a fellow Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, made remarks comparing Stronach to a prostitute, Miller spoke out on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, condemning Abbott's remarks. After his speech, Abbott reportedly attempted to assault Miller in the corridor behind the Chamber. Due to a security guard's intervention, a major confrontation was prevented. This matter was resolved when Abbott apologized publicly for any perceived wrongs. Though Edmonton-Rutherford was perceived as an Alberta Liberal stronghold since the 1989 provincial election (in which Liberal MLA Percy Wickman defeated Premier Don Getty in his own riding), Rick Miller lost by 58 votes to PC candidate Fred Horne in 2008; this margin widened in the 2012 election. On October 26, 2013, Rick Miller died of prostate cancer in Edmonton, he was survived by his wife and two children.",

A Liberal, he was a member of the opposition shadow cabinet.

He was re-elected in the 2006 election following which he joined the cabinet. One October 3, 2006 he was sworn in as Minister of Fisheries under the Shawn Graham government. He maintained this role throughout all of the four years the Liberals were in government.

Doucet would sit in Opposition from 2010 to 2014, with his riding remaining the only Liberal controlled riding in southwestern New Brunswick. During his time in Opposition, Doucet was critic, at various periods, of Energy, Transportation and Public Safety.

For this election, Doucet's principal challenger was incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA Jim Parrott. On September 22, 2014 Doucet was re-elected for a 4th consecutive time.",

  "text" : "(This is a Malay name; the name Aziz is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Rafidah.) Tan Sri Rafidah binti Aziz (born 4 November 1943) is a Malaysian politician who was Member of Parliament for the Kuala Kangsar constituency from 1986 to 2013. Born in Kuala Kangsar, Perak, Rafidah was Minister of International Trade and Industry from 1987 to 2008. As minister, she was the chairman of MATRADE beginning in 1991. Rafidah was the head of United Malays National Organisation's Woman Wing (Wanita UMNO in Malay) from 1999 to 2009, before losing out in the 2009 UMNO General Assembly election to Shahrizat Abdul Jalil after seeking re-election for another term. In 2006, Rafidah was accused of corruption related to the issuance of Approved Permits (AP) for importing foreign vehicles by former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad in his series of criticisms against the Government of Malaysia. Mahathir had also criticised then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's handling of the Approved Permits (AP) issue, expressing his surprise that Rafidah was still retained as a Cabinet member although two people on the list of persons issued with highest number of APs were linked to her. In March 2008, following the general election held in that month, Rafidah was dropped from cabinet, despite winning her parliamentary seat when other ministers had lost theirs. After thirty two years in government service, and twenty years as a minister, she described herself as being \"blessed and content.\" When asked if she was saddened, she said that she wished Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had told her earlier on not to contest the election. Rafidah was an active member in the Malaysian political scene, having previously been appointed as a Member of the Malaysian Parliament. She was appointed as Senator in 1974 and resigned to contest in the General Elections in 1978. She served as Member of Parliament in the Selayang Constituency (from 1978 to 1982) and Kuala Kangsar Constituency (from 1982 to 2013). She served in the UMNO Supreme Council for 38 years since winning a seat in the council in 1975. She is Malaysia's longest-serving Minister of International Trade and Industry, having served in that capacity from 1987 to 2008. Previously, she also hold the portfolio of Minister of Public Enterprises from 1980 to 1987 and Deputy Minister of Finance from 1977 to 1980. In 1976, she was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Public Enterprises. Rafidah also had experience lecturing at the faculty of Economics and Administration at the University of Malaya. She started her career as a tutor and lecturer in the Faculty of Economics, University of Malaya from 1966 to 1976. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1966 and a Masters degree in Economics in 1970, both from the same university. Rafidah currently serves as the Non-Executive Independent Chairman and Director of AirAsia X since March 3, 2011. She is also the Chairman of Supermax Corporation Berhad since June 16, 2015.",

In responding to Clayburgh's resignation, Governor John Hoeven described him as \"a dedicated servant of North Dakota for the past twenty years\" who had served with \"integrity and distinction\" and stated that he would be missed. Clayburgh was well-favored in his 2002 campaign for North Dakota's at-large congressional district against incumbent Democrat Earl Pomeroy, and ran an aggressive campaign including a visit from then-Vice President Dick Cheney in Fargo, North Dakota. He raised over US$1 million for the campaign. Despite the efforts, Pomeroy edged out Clayburgh and won re-election, with 52% of the vote.",

  "text" : "Russell Cunningham (born December 29, 1904, date of death March 6, 1985) was a Canadian social democratic politician from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. He was the leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Nova Scotia from 1945 until 1953. He succeeded Donald MacDonald as the party's leader, after MacDonald lost his seat in the 1945 general election.He represented the electoral district (riding) of Cape Breton East in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1945 until 1956. Due to the Conservatives not electing a single member to the Assembly, Cunningham became the leader of the Official Opposition during the 44th General Assembly of Nova Scotia. Even though the CCF lost a seat, it was the first time they ever were the Official Opposition. Their successor party, the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party (NDP) would not duplicate that accomplishment again until 1998, over 50 years later. He was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia in 1904. Mr. Cunningham met and Married Violet Miller and had eight children. Shirley (Pettigrew), Joan (Roberts), Marilyn (Wheeliker), Robert, David, Donald, Clarence, and Kenneth. They began their wedded life purchasing the Bradbury farm on Big Glace Bay Lake. They moved on to a farm property at Sand Lake and then, in December 1945, purchased the Marconi property (including the radio station VAS, Voice of the Atlantic Seaboard) a few miles out of Glace Bay, NS where they raised their family and resided until he passed in 1985 and she in 1989.",

  "text" : "Roger Amidon (or Amadon, Amidown, Amadowne) was an early settler of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Roger Amidon was a French Huguenot, who had arrived with John Endecott's advance company after escaping to England from the Siege of La Rochelle in 1628. Roger was a ship's carpenter. He is first recorded at Salem, Massachusetts, where there was a flourishing shipbuilding industry in the early 17th century. On 25 December 1637 at a town meeting it was agreed that the marsh and meadow land in Salem which had been common land was to be \"proportioned out unto [the inhabitants of Salem] accordingly to heads of their families -- to those that have the greatest number an acre thereof and to those that have least not above half an acre and to those that are betweene both three quarters of an acre\". Roger was 89th on the list and drew half an acre of meadow land. He was the only person in his household—see History of Salem. He was probably married around 1639 and moved to Weymouth where his daughter Sarah was baptised in 1640. Three years later the baptism of his daughter Lydia was recorded in Boston. He had at least two more children around this time, but their birth records have yet to be found. He got into some trouble in Boston and on 5 January 1644 he \"was enjoined to pay 2 shillings and 6 pence fees, admonished and discharged\". Not long afterwards he moved to Rehoboth (Seekonk) where in July 1648 he drew a house lot. The houses formed a semicircle around the commons and Roger's home was located at the northeastern end of the circle—see Early Rehoboth by Bowen. His last child by his wife Sarah was baptised in Rehoboth in 1652. In 1658 he took the Oath of Fidelity at Rehoboth and at a town meeting held on 22 June 1658 he participated in the drawing of meadow lots, lying on the north side of the town. The lots were drawn \"according to person and estate\". Roger was number 43 in a list of 49 men drawing lots—see Rehoboth Town Records. Until 1685 Plymouth Colony included the western portion of Rhode Island and for a time Roger lived in Warwick [see Land Records, A:254], which would become part of Kent County, Rhode Island. In 1659 he was sued for neglect in Warwick by Robert Hearngton who was master of the \"Barke Deborn\"—see Early Records of the Town of Warwick. Roger was one of the jurors impanneled at an inquest held at Rehoboth in 1661. That year Rehoboth acquired additional land from the Indians, which would become known as the North Purchase. It contained part of the 50 acres (200,000 m2) that Rehoboth had already granted Roger. His first wife Sarah died in 1668. Within months he remarried and over the next four years became the father of three more children. He died suddenly in 1673 and, due to some suspicion that he had been murdered by his wife, a coroners inquest was held on 11 November 1673. The jury found his death had been a natural one. Roger died intestate and his land was divided between his widow and surviving children: He was one of the early settlers of Rehoboth, and the present city of Attleboro is partially on land purchased from Amidon.",

In May 1636, Risley left Massachusetts with almost the entire company he had arrived with two and a half years earlier. They found John Winthrop to be too dictatorial. The group headed west through the wilderness, and after a month stopped in an area now occupied by the city of Hartford, Connecticut. Within the year, the group started a collective government to fight the Pequot War. By the next year, they had adopted what is now generally considered the first written constitution in Western history, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The group eventually signed a treaty with the Indians for a tract of land and settled down. The present-day state capitol building in Hartford sits on the original Risley land grant. Risley died at Hockanum, Connecticut of typhoid in October 1648, leaving his wife and three children, ages two months to eight years.",

In 1980, he was elected business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, where he represented 1300 unionized workers. He was later employed with the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation, and the Guysborough Journal as advertising manager. Chisholm served as a municipal councillor in the District of St. Mary's from 1988 to 1999, serving as Warden from 1994 to 1999. Chisholm first attempted to enter provincial politics in the 1998 election, but was defeated by Liberal incumbent Ray White. Chisholm ran again in 1999, and defeated White by 134 votes. He was re-elected in the newly established Guysborough-Sheet Harbour riding in the 2003 election. When Rodney MacDonald took over as premier in February 2006, Chisholm was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia, as Minister of Agriculture, and Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. He was re-elected in 2006, and retained the fisheries and aquaculture portfolio in a post-election cabinet shuffle. Chisholm was defeated when he ran for re-election in 2009, losing to New Democrat Jim Boudreau by more than 1800 votes.",

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice and Howden, Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, having previously been Minister of State at the Foreign Office from July 1994 to April 1997. Davis was raised on Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, South West London. After attending Bec Grammar School in Tooting, London, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with Tate & Lyle. Entering Parliament in 1987 at the age of 38 for the Boothferry constituency, in his subsequent political career he held the positions of Conservative party chairman and Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the shadow cabinet, under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and then second. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary. This was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP in June 2008, he officially became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won it in July 2008. In 2010, Davis was invited by Prime Minister David Cameron to join the cabinet of his coalition government, but he declined and stayed on the backbenches. In July 2016, following the UK voting to leave the European Union, Davis was appointed by Theresa May as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.",

Williams' premiership was considered controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador. Events such as ordering all Canadian flags to be removed from provincial government buildings, and launching the Anything But Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election, garnered national attention. While Williams remains a controversial politician outside Newfoundland and Labrador, he was continuously ranked as one of the most popular premiers in Canada, with approval ratings in the province consistently in the high seventies and eighties.",

  "text" : "Daniel Lionel Hanington (June 27, 1835 – May 5, 1909) was a New Brunswick, Canada politician and jurist. He was born at Shediac, New Brunswick, the son of Daniel Hanington, and was educated there and at Mount Allison Academy in Sackville. He went on to study law and was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1861. In that same year, he married Emily Myers Wetmore. He served as a school trustee for several years and was clerk for the Westmorland County court from 1867 to 1870. Hanington ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature for Westmorland in 1870 but was elected in an 1870 by-election as a Liberal-Conservative. He was defeated in 1874 then regained his seat in 1878 and entered the cabinet of Premier John James Fraser as minister without portfolio and succeeded Fraser as premier in 1882. Hanington was sympathetic to Acadian rights and appointed a member of that community, Pierre-Amand Landry, to the senior cabinet position of provincial secretary. However, Hanington faced a leader of the opposition, Andrew G. Blair who had organised the Liberal Party into a powerful force. In 1883, Blair defeated Hanington's Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence and won the subsequent election. Hanington continued as leader of the opposition but was unable to defeat Blair's Liberals in the 1886 election. He remained in the legislature until 1896 when he accepted an appointment to the bench as a member of the province's Supreme Court. He was the presiding judge at the last trial of Tom Collins.",

The Croydon seats were reorganised ahead of the 1997 General Election, with the loss of one seat. Congdon competed against Sir Paul Beresford, then MP for Croydon Central, for the Conservative nomination for the new merged seat and won. He then lost in the ensuing election in 1997 to Labour's Geraint Davies. Sir Paul Beresford, meanwhile, successfully contested Mole Valley and continued as an MP. Congdon stood once again against Geraint Davies at the 2001 election and lost. He then worked for MENCAP, and did not stand again at the 2005 election, when the Conservative candidate Andrew Pelling recaptured the seat from Davies. Congdon is now retired and lives, with his wife, Theresa, in Old Coulsdon.",

Grotberg is an Anderson, North Dakota town councilman and a farmer from Sanborn in Barnes County. Grotberg received the Republican nomination for the Senior U.S. senate seat in North Dakota at the state GOP convention in late March 2006. Despite running for office in the historically conservative state of North Dakota, Grotberg faced a difficult campaign due to the Senator's name recognition, long tenure in office, available funds, and popularity.",

Urodził się w Chicago, burmistrzem Rosemont został wybrany w 1956 i sprawował ten urząd przez 51 (najdłużej w historii USA). Wniósł znaczny wkład w rozwój miejscowości wykorzystując bliskość lotniska O’Hare. Zachęcił sieć hoteli Hyatt do budowy pierwszego hotelu w rejonie Chicago. Stworzył też pierwszą z sal widowiskowych obecnie Allstate Arena. Kilka lat temu burmistrz starał się uzyskać zgodę na zbudowanie kasyna w Rosemont jednak przedstawiciele Illinois cofnęli wydaną wcześniej zgodę spowodowaną rzekomą współpracą z grupami przestępczymi. Ostatecznie do końca życia nie udało mu się oczyścić z nieoficjalnie stawianych mu zarzutów, nigdy jednak nie był za nic sądzony ani skazany. Zmarł w wieku 79 lat na raka żołądka.",

  "text" : "Sir Richard Dawson Bates, 1st Baronet OBE PC JP DL (23 November 1876 – 10 June 1949), known as Dawson Bates, was an Ulster Unionist Party member of the Northern Ireland House of Commons. He was born in Strandtown, Belfast, the son of Richard Dawson Bates, solicitor and Clerk of the Crown, and Mary Dill. His paternal grandfather, John Bates (d. 1855), had been a minor figure in the Conservative Party in Belfast, before his duties were discharged on a Chancery Court ruling of maladministration. Bates was educated at Coleraine Academical Institution. After studying at Queen's College, Belfast, became a solicitor in 1900, in 1908 founding a firm with his uncle - E and R.D. Bates, later R.B.Uprichard would be apprenticed, become a partner and eventually take over the firm of E and R.D. Bates and Uprichard, as Crown Solicitor. In 1906 Bates was appointed Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council. During this time, he was instrumental in the events of Ulster Day and in the formation of the UVF, organised the Larne gun-running and supported the formation of the Ulster Unionist Labour Association to counter socialism. He toured Northern Ireland, working hard to build up the Unionist Party, while portraying all Roman Catholics as traitors. Bates stood down as Secretary on his election to Stormont in 1921, where he represented first East Belfast and later Belfast Victoria. In the government of Sir James Craig he was the first Minister for Home Affairs and a member of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland. He introduced the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, but opposed the Ulster Protestant Association. Under his administration, he was accused of gerrymandering, and of intervening to ensure that prison sentences were not imposed on Protestants who attacked Catholics. Bates was also a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of County Down. He married Jessie Muriel Cleland, daughter of Sir Charles John Cleland. They had one son, Major Sir John Dawson Bates, 2nd Baronet(an Oxford-educated Wykehamist, d. 1998). He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1919 New Year Honours, Knight Bachelor in 1921 and was made a baronet of Magherabuoy, near Portrush, in County Londonderry on 7 June 1937. In his retirement strained financial circumstances and security (he constantly required a police escort) led him to rent Butleigh House, near Glastonbury, Somerset. It was here he died in 1949; Sir Dawson's body was flown back to Ulster for burial at Ballywillan Church of Ireland. Bates was a director and president of Glentoran Football Club.",

Lownsdale purchased the land that would become downtown Portland on September 22, 1848. He resurveyed Portland, keeping the small blocks (200 feet per side, 64 feet streets), and adding the contiguous park blocks. He became involved in a land dispute involving the authority of the laws from the Provisional Government with Josiah Lamberson Parrish. Lownsdale would defend the matter in court in a case that would make its way through the Oregon Supreme Court and to the United States Supreme Court in Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858).

  "text" : "Dennis Pennington (May 18, 1776 – September 2, 1854) was a farmer and a stonemason who became known for his many years in public office as an early legislator in the Indiana Territory and in Indiana's General Assembly as a representative of Harrison County, Indiana. Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens.",

  "text" : "Marc Daniel Cohn-Bendit ([ˈdaːniːɛl koːn ˈbɛndɪt] (dt.) oder [da.niɛl ˌkɔn bɛnˈdit] (frz.); * 4. April 1945 in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne, Frankreich) ist ein deutsch-französischer Publizist und Politiker von Bündnis 90/Die Grünen und Europe Écologie-Les Verts. Im Mai 1968 wurde er prominenter Sprecher der Studenten in Paris. Nach seiner Ausweisung aus Frankreich war er im Sozialistischen Deutschen Studentenbund (SDS) und der APO aktiv. In den 1970er Jahren gehörte er zur Sponti-Szene in Frankfurt am Main und gab das Stadtmagazin Pflasterstrand heraus. Ab 1978 engagierte er sich für die damals entstehende Partei der Grünen und entwickelte sich dort mit Joschka Fischer zu einem Vertreter des „Realo“-Flügels. 1989 bis 1997 war er der erste Dezernent des neu eingerichteten Amts für multi-kulturelle Angelegenheiten in Frankfurt am Main. Von 1994 bis 2014 war er Mitglied im Europäischen Parlament. Ab 2002 war er dort Co-Vorsitzender der Fraktion der Grünen / Europäische Freie Allianz. Er kandidierte abwechselnd für die deutschen Grünen und die französischen Les Verts bzw. Europe Écologie-Les Verts. Zur Europawahl 2014 zog sich Cohn-Bendit aus der aktiven Politik zurück. Er begründete dies mit der gesundheitlichen Belastung, werde aber weiterhin „demonstrieren gehen“. Cohn-Bendit schrieb zahlreiche politische Aufsätze und Bücher und moderiert verschiedene Fernsehsendungen. Er wohnt in Frankfurt am Main, ist seit 1997 mit seiner langjährigen Partnerin Ingrid Apel verheiratet. Er hat mit ihr einen Sohn und zog Ingrids Sohn Niko Apel mit auf.",

Kapitans were appointed chiefs or headmen of the various ethnic communities during the British colonial rule in what is present-day Malaysia. Kapitans played an important role in the history of the Chinese in Malaysia. They wielded considerable influence, contributing to social, economic and political development in areas under their jurisdiction. Yap Kwan Seng, of Hakka descent, was born in 1846 in the Chak Kai district of China. He moved to Malaya at the age of 18 and worked as a tin miner in Seremban. On his death, The Straits Times carried the following obituary: TOWKAY Yap Kwan Seng, the Captain China of Selangor, died at Kuala Lumpur on Friday, of consumption, at the age of fifty-five years, of which he had spent forty in the Straits. He came from the Canton province and had resided thirty-two years in Selangor. He had held the post of Captain China there since 1889. The deceased was popular among all classes and was a liberal giver to charities. He was a Trustee of the Victoria Institution to whose funds he liberally subscribed. He gave $10,000 to the Transvaal War Fund and also a handsome donation to St. Mary's Church building fund. He was always a good friend to his poorer countrymen, for whom he established a practically free dispensary. During the Pahang rebellion he rendered much assistance to the Government and was thanked for his services. He leaves behind him five wives here and three in China, also a large family consisting of fifteen sons and ten daughters.",

Kada ist Absolventin der landwirtschaftlichen Fakultät der Universität Kyōto. Während ihres Studiums lebte sie 1972 für ein halbes Jahr in Tansania. Nach ihrem Abschluss 1973 setzte sie ihre Studien an der University of Wisconsin fort. Anschließend blieb sie in der Forschung, zunächst am Biwa-See-Forschungsinstitut, später an der Kyōto-Seika-Universität, wo sie seit 2000 Professorin für Umweltsoziologie war. 2006 verließ sie die Universität, um zur Wahl für den Gouverneursposten in Shiga anzutreten. Zu ihren Forderungen im Wahlkampf gehörten unter anderem Baustopps für neue Shinkansen-Bahnhöfe, Dammprojekte und eine Mülldeponie in Shiga. Ihre Kandidatur wurde von der Sozialdemokratischen Partei (SDP) unterstützt. Bei der Wahl am 2. Juli 2006 setzte sie sich mit 217.842 Stimmen gegen den Amtsinhaber Yoshitsugu Kunimatsu (185.344 Stimmen) durch, der von der LDP, der DPJ und der Kōmeitō unterstützt wurde. Sie war die erste weibliche Gouverneurin der Präfektur Shiga, die fünfte landesweit. Bei der Wahl 2010 wurde sie mit Unterstützung von DPJ und SDP mit 63 % der Stimmen wiedergewählt. Im November 2012 gründete Kada für die Shūgiin-Wahl 2012 die Nippon Mirai no Tō („Zukunftspartei Japans“), die einen Atomausstieg, eine Reduzierung der Benachteiligung von Frauen in der japanischen Arbeitswelt und bessere Bedingungen für Familien mit Kindern anstrebte. Die Partei versammelte viele, überwiegend vorher aus den Regierungsparteien ausgetretene Abgeordnete, insbesondere die DPJ-Abspaltung von Ichirō Ozawa, spaltete sich aber kurz nach der Wahl wieder, bei der sie von 62 auf 9 Sitze zurückfiel. In der Partei verblieb nur eine Abgeordnete. In Shiga wurde Kada wegen ihrer Doppelrolle in nationaler und Präfekturpolitik kritisiert und trat im Januar 2013 vom Parteivorsitz zurück. Zur Gouverneurswahl 2014 zog sich Kada nach zwei Amtszeiten zurück, der von ihr unterstützte Taizō Mikazuki wurde zu ihrem Nachfolger gewählt.",

  "text" : "Yves Ducharme (né à Montréal en 1958), fut maire de la ville de Hull au Québec, en Outaouais, de 1992 à 2001. À la suite de la fusion des villes de Hull, Gatineau, Aylmer, Buckingham et de Masson-Angers, il fut élu maire de la nouvelle ville de Gatineau en novembre 2001. Il fut défait aux élections de novembre 2005 par Marc Bureau. M. Ducharme est actuellement le directeur, Affaires réglementaires et Liaison, à l’Administration canadienne de la sûreté du transport aérien. Il détient une licence en droit de l’Université d’Ottawa et est membre du Barreau du Québec depuis novembre 1984. Il exerça la profession d’avocat pendant huit années, jusqu'à son élection à la mairie de Hull. Au cours de ses années de vie politique, il fut appelé à siéger sur de nombreux conseils d’administration, dont celui du Centre national des arts et de la Fédération canadienne des municipalités. En juin 2003, il fut élu président de la Fédération canadienne des municipalités. À titre de président, il eut le principal mandat de mener la campagne « Comblons l’écart » qui visait à permettre aux municipalités canadiennes de toucher de nouvelle source de revenu provenant entre autres d’une partie de la taxe d’accise sur l’essence et de l’exemption du paiement de la taxe sur les produits et services. Les succès remportés au cours de ce mandat lui ont valu d’être inscrit au tableau d’honneur de la Fédération. Au cours de son mandat à la mairie, Yves Ducharme s’est aussi démarqué au niveau international. De juin 2000 à 2005, il a occupé le poste de conseiller spécial au centre des Nations unies pour les établissements Humains situés à Nairobi, au Kenya. Il fut de plus appelé à siéger à titre de vice-président pour l’Amérique du Nord, de l’Association mondiale citée et gouvernements locaux unis, dont le siège social est situé à Barcelone, Espagne. Le 28 septembre 2006, Yves Ducharme s’est vu décerné par le président du Mexique, la médaille de l’Aigle aztèque. L'ordre mexicain de l'Aguila Azteca, créé en 1933, est la distinction la plus importante que le gouvernement du Mexique confère aux citoyens étrangers en reconnaissance de leurs actions positives envers le Mexique.",

  "text" : "Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky's Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems. Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia's Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title \"the players' commissioner\". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951. Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor.",

Dickieson taught high school in Calgary, Alberta for one year before entering medical school at Dalhousie University, from which he graduated with his medical degree in 1987. Dickieson interned in New Brunswick and in Prince Edward Island and established a family medicine practise in O'Leary. Dickieson was elected leader of the Island New Democrats in March 1995, and led the party in the 1996 and 2000 provincial elections, seeking to be a Member of the Legislature for District 25, West Point-Bloomfield. He was successful in the 1996 election, but was defeated in the 2000 election. Dickieson led the party through the 1990s, but resigned two years after his personal electoral defeat. Dickieson was a popular politician during his term, even among non-New Democrats, as a voice for change. He was pressured by many members to run for the federal New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election and again provincially, he had refused until he announced on September 12, 2014 that he would seek the NDP nomination for Egmont for the 2015 federal election. Dickieson was nominated as the candidate in October 2014. On October 19, 2015, Dickieson was defeated in the election, finishing third behind the winner, Liberal Bobby Morrissey and Conservative incumbent Gail Shea. Dickieson was always involved in local and provincial issues, including concern over the closing of rural post offices, the fate of farmers, and the quality of education, particularly among children. He has served on boards for the promotion of a community youth centre, as a Chamber of Commerce board of directors, and as Chief of Medical Staff at the Community Hospital.

He served in Churchill's wartime coalition cabinet. As Chancellor, he pushed his cheap money policy too hard, and mishandled the sterling crisis of 1947. Dalton's political position was already in jeopardy in 1947, when, he, seemingly inadvertently, revealed a sentence of the budget to a reporter minutes before delivering his budget speech. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted his resignation, but he later returned to the cabinet in relatively minor positions. His biographer Ben Pimlott characterised Dalton as peevish, irascible, given to poor judgment and lacking administrative talent. He also recognised that Dalton was a genuine radical and an inspired politician; a man, to quote his old friend and critic John Freeman, 'of feeling, humanity, and unshakeable loyalty to people which matched his talent.'",

He received his B.A. degree from Loyola College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1920. While in school, O'Conor was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun from 1919 to 1920. On November 24, 1920, O'Conor married Mary Eugenia Byrnes (1896–1971) and they had five children, Herbert R. Jr., Eugene F., James Patrick, Robert and Mary Patricia. From 1921 to 1922, O'Conor served as the assistant state's attorney for Baltimore. In 1923, he was elected State's Attorney of Baltimore City, and served there until he was elected as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1934. O'Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner SS Morro Castle in 1934. O'Conor identified her body which was found face under close to the wreck site. O'Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O'Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor's Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943. Near the end of World War II, O'Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system. O'Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, Hughes served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery.",

Harry Nice was born in Washington D.C., but was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He later attended Baltimore City College, Dickinson College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1899. He was married to Edna Viola Amos in 1905, with whom he had two sons, Harry Jr, and William, who died in childhood. Nice served as assistant to the State's Attorney in Baltimore, but later resigned to run for the Republican nomination for governor of Maryland in 1919. He lost to Democrat Albert C. Ritchie by a narrow margin. Following the defeat, Nice accepted a position in the Appeals Tax Court of Baltimore City as a judge from 1920 until 1924. In 1934, running under the campaign motto of \"Right the wrong of 1919\", Nice again challenged Ritchie and defeated him by 6,149 votes. Nice rose to become governor during the national depression, which brought great financial hardships to the state budget. To help find a solution to the situation, Nice assigned a committee to investigate ways of alleviating the debt, but was not pleased with the recommendations of raising taxes. Neither he nor the Maryland General Assembly felt it would be wise to raise taxes at such a rate. Also as governor, Nice redesigned the governors' residence at Government House, changing the architectural style from Victorian to Georgian. After losing the support of his party, Nice was defeated by Herbert R. O'Conor in 1938. He attempted to run for the U.S. Senate in 1940, but was unsuccessful and resumed his law practice in Baltimore. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery.",

  "text" : "Henry Thomas Muggeridge (26 June 1864 – 25 March 1942) was a British politician. He was the father of the author and journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. Muggeridge was born the son of a Penge undertaker on 26 June 1864. When the family was abandoned by his father, Muggeridge left school and began work as an office boy in the City of London. The little money he kept for himself was spent on books, and it was his avid lunchtime reading that led to a keen interest in politics. His second job was again as an office boy for a firm of shirtmakers, where he stayed until he retired. He eventually became Company Secretary, but had turned down a directorship, as he felt it would be at odds with his political principles. In 1893, Muggeridge married Annie Booler, the daughter of a Sheffield factory foreman, and they had five sons, Malcolm being the middle child. Malcolm would later describe his father as a small bearded man with a large frame, a twinkling eye, and a rather bulbous nose. One of Malcolm's quoted memories of his father is of his visits to the Surrey Street Market, where he would set up his platform and expound his views on the need for socialism: \"Now ladies and gentlemen. It's His Majesty's Government, His Majesty's Navy, His Majesty's Stationery Office, His Majesty's this and His Majesty's that. But it's the National Debt. Why isn't that His Majesty's? We'll gladly let His Majesty have that, won't we?\" Muggeridge's early interest in politics at first led to his joining the Penge Liberals, and with them he campaigned for local improvements. By his late twenties he was a socialist, and he joined first the Fabians, then the Independent Labour Party. An excellent public speaker, he founded and became secretary of the Croydon Socialist Society in 1895, and stood for the Croydon Borough Council in Norwood in 1896 and 1897. He was not to be successful until November 1911, although Croydon had already had several Labour councillors. Muggeridge was the first President of Ruskin House, the Labour and Trade Union centre in Croydon, having been instrumental in its relocation and refounding. Muggeridge remained a Croydon councillor until 1930, at which time he also became a Justice of the Peace. He was instrumental in getting Croydon's first council houses built and campaigned for Trade Union rates of pay for all municipal employees. Although he stood for Parliament in Croydon South four times, in 1918, 1922, 1923, and 1924, Muggeridge finally became a member of parliament for Romford in 1929. He lost his seat in 1931 and returned to Croydon Council in 1933, retiring in 1940, at the age of 75. He died in Hastings, East Sussex, in 1942 and was buried in Whatlington, near Battle, East Sussex.",

  "text" : "Hilbrand Pier Anne Nawijn (born August 8, 1948) is a Dutch politician of the Party for the Netherlands (PVN). He was Minister for Integration & Immigration from July 22, 2002 until May 27, 2003 and later a Member of the House of Representatives for the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF). Nawijn was born in Kampen. The son of a burgemeester (mayor), he is a descendant of Firmin Navin, a French Huguenot who had fled to Holland in 1696 to escape persecution. After graduating Emelwerda College in Emmeloord he studied law at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. Following a long career working for the Dutch Ministry of Justice he was elected in 2002 as a member of the Christen-Democratisch Appèl for the city council of Zoetermeer. Nawijn was an early supporter of the openly gay, populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn and in 2002, when Fortuyn founded the Pim Fortuyn List, Nawijn earned a place on the list. Despite the assassination of Fortuyn by an animal rights activist, which happened days before the election, the LPF emerged with a successful result, thus bringing Nawijn into the Dutch House of Representatives. He was appointed Minister for Integration and Immigration in the first Balkenende cabinet. Due to the instability of the LPF following Fortuyn's assassination, the first Balkenende cabinet lasted briefly, leading to early elections in 2003. Due to Nawijn's controversial conservative positions such as his support of the death penalty, which horrified many people in the Netherlands, he was placed at the bottom of the LPF's electoral list. This should have made it almost impossible for Nawijn to be reelected, however, the same statements which made him so unpopular to the political establishment won him a following among voters. On election day Nawijn received enough individual votes to once again enter the House of Representatives. Despite still being a member of the LPF, Nawijn often was at odds with the party. In January 2005, he left the fragmented LPF with the goal of founding his own political party which conceptually would lean closer towards the ideas of the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang. Together with one of the leaders of Vlaams Belang, Filip Dewinter, in June 2005 he announced the founding of a think tank during a controversial meeting in the former house of murdered politician Pim Fortuyn. Marten Fortuyn, Pim Fortuyn's brother, called this action provocative, and \"I had expected otherwise from Nawijn.\" The influential Dutch magazine Elsevier writes: \"According to (the LPF member of parliament) Varela, it was widely known that Pim Fortuyn wanted nothing to do with Dewinter, who's party Vlaams Blok (resurrected as Vlaams Belang) had the previous year been forbidden due to racism.\" In the Dutch municipal elections of 2006, Nawijn managed, with his own new party, to gather 5 out of 39 seats in his hometown Zoetermeer. Later that year he entered the 2006 Dutch elections with a new party, the Partij voor Nederland (Party for the Netherlands), but obtained no seats. During his campaign, Nawijn voiced his support for accepting CIA black sites into the Netherlands in an interview in October 2006 in the Dutch newspaper Spits. In early 2007, Nawijn participated in the Dutch version of So You Wanna Be a Popstar?, broadcast by the Dutch commercial TV channel SBS6, granting him fulfilment of one of his dreams. He stated that \"Now that I have left national politics, I can do such things. An additional advantage is that it will keep me a bit 'in the picture'\". As a result of his performances at the talent contest, which were met with public ridicule, Nawijn signed up for a five-year contract as a singer. His first single came out in May 2007, Hey Jumpen, in the jumpstyle genre, and reached #45 in the Dutch Single Top 100 charts. In February 2008 he returned to his original career in law.",

Prior to holding elective office, he served in the U.S. Army during World War II where he earned the Purple Heart and the Silver Star. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1956 and 1960. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1963, where he served until his election to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1966. He eventually attained the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee from which position he worked closely with Speaker of the House Herbert Fineman to appropriate money to Philadelphia. In 1977, Cianfrani was convicted on federal charges of racketeering and mail fraud for padding his Senate payroll. His case was prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by U.S. attorney David W. Marston, who was later removed from the position by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Cianfrani was sentenced to five years in federal prison. After serving for twenty-seven months, he was released in 1980. In the middle 1970s, he began dating political reporter Laura Foreman of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The two moved in together and she reportedly accepted money and gifts from him while she was still reporting on him for her newspaper. After the affair became public in 1977 she was fired by her employer, The New York Times. She and Cianfrani married in 1980, after his divorce from his first wife was finalized and he was released from federal prison. Years after his release, his political career enjoyed a resurgence. In 1988 Cianfrani won back his old position as Philadelphia ward leader and regained a measure of clout within Philadelphia politics. He was considered a mentor to many Philadelphia politicians, including Congressman Bob Brady and Senator Vince Fumo. Cianfrani died of a stroke in Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 2002.",

The son of a manufacturer, Wilson's family had extensive business interests in the area of Picton, Ontario. Wilson studied medicine and moved to Edmonton in 1882, one of the first physicians to settle there. He was appointed to official medical positions and, for several years, owned a drugstore in town. He served as a consultant to First Nations reserves near Edmonton and also became a director of many local corporations. He was elected to the Territorial council in 1885, and soon became its speaker. During his speakership, he helped to change the council's rules and procedures. He left territorial politics after six years, citing health reasons. He maintained a medical practice in town for many years, and went to considerable efforts to keep up with the latest practices. Wilson interested himself in civic activities in Edmonton, and eventually ran for mayor, winning election in 1895. He left office after less than two years in a dispute over town funds. He attempted a comeback in 1904, but was defeated in a run for the town council. He married in 1886, and had a son and two daughters. He died in 1909; an industrial park in the city is named for him.",

He ran for re-election the following year against Levi Boone, of the American Party and lost with 47% of the vote.

Zugleich vertrat er die Republik während ihrer Existenzzeit als Repräsentant in Nanjing. Nachdem er 1949 zunächst im indischen Teil Kaschmirs Zuflucht suchte, floh er 1954 in die Türkei. Dort erlangte er schließlich auch die türkische Staatsangehörigkeit. Alptekin starb am 17. Dezember 1995 in Istanbul im Alter von 94 Jahren.

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014.",

November 1998 war er Ministerpräsident des Saarlandes. Er war Kanzlerkandidat der SPD für die Bundestagswahl am 2. Dezember 1990 (kurz nach der Wiedervereinigung) und von 1995 bis 1999 SPD-Vorsitzender. Nach der Bundestagswahl im September 1998 – Gerhard Schröder wurde Bundeskanzler – übernahm er im Kabinett Schröder I das Bundesministerium der Finanzen. Im März 1999 legte er überraschend alle politischen Ämter – auch sein Bundestagsmandat – nieder und trat fortan als Kritiker des rot-grünen Regierungskurses von Gerhard Schröder auf. 2005 wechselte Lafontaine von der SPD zur neu gegründeten Wahlalternative Arbeit & soziale Gerechtigkeit (WASG). Diese ging durch seine Initiative im Juni 2005 ein Wahlbündnis mit der PDS ein, die sich dafür in Die Linkspartei.PDS umbenannte. Von 2005 bis 2009 war Lafontaine mit Gregor Gysi Fraktionsvorsitzender der Linksfraktion im Deutschen Bundestag. Vom 16. Juni 2007 bis zum 15. Mai 2010 war er neben Lothar Bisky Parteivorsitzender der neugebildeten Partei Die Linke. Sein Rückzug von beiden politischen Ämtern erfolgte aufgrund einer am 17. November 2009 bekannt gewordenen Krebserkrankung. Seit September 2009 führt er die Fraktion der Linken im saarländischen Landtag. Bei der Landtagswahl im Saarland im März 2012 trat Lafontaine erneut als Spitzenkandidat seiner Partei an und ist seit dem Amtsantritt des zweiten Kabinetts Kramp-Karrenbauer am 9. Mai 2012 Oppositionsführer.",

This was considered one of the biggest upsets of the election, as many people had expected Arlooktoo to become premier of Nunavut.

In October of that year he was selected by the First Executive Committee to serve as the supreme judge for the Provisional Government of Oregon and served until May 14, 1844. In 1844, he was elected to the second Executive Committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon. He was allied with the group that planned to create an independent Republic of the Pacific and thus was unsuccessful in his run for governor of the Provisional Government in 1845, losing to George Abernethy. Russell eventually went to California.

He was noted for his political radicalism, his opposition to the conservative Bourbon Democracy of President Grover Cleveland, his support for labor unions, and his opposition to the Chinese in Oregon. He was also noted for his prickly attitude toward both U.S. Presidents whose terms overlapped his own -- Benjamin Harrison and Cleveland, whom he once famously told via telegram to mind his own business. He later served as mayor of Portland from 1896 to 1898.",

  "text" : "Sebastian Newbold Coe, Baron Coe, CH, KBE, FRIBA (born 29 September 1956), often referred to as Seb Coe or Lord Coe, is a British politician and former track and field athlete. As a middle-distance runner, Lord Coe won four Olympic medals, including the 1500 metres gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984. He set eight outdoor and three indoor world records in middle-distance track events – including, in 1979, setting three world records in the space of 41 days – and the world record he set in the 800 metres in 1981 remained unbroken until 1997. Coe's rivalries with fellow Britons Steve Ovett and Steve Cram dominated middle-distance racing for much of the 1980s. Following Coe's retirement from athletics, he was a member of parliament for the Conservative Party from 1992 to 1997 for Falmouth and Camborne in Cornwall, and became a Life Peer on 16 May 2000.He headed the successful London bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and became chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. In 2007, he was elected a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and re-elected for another four-year term in 2011. In August 2015 he was elected president of the IAAF. In 2012, Coe was appointed Pro-Chancellor at Loughborough University where he had been an undergraduate, and is also a member of the University's governing body. In November 2012 he was appointed chairman of the British Olympic Association. In 2012 he was one of 24 athletes inducted as inaugural members of the IAAF Hall of Fame. Coe was presented with the Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in December 2012.",

  "text" : "Sir Richard Stafford Cripps, CH, PC, FRS (24 April 1889 – 21 April 1952) was a British Labour politician of the first half of the 20th century. A wealthy barrister by background, he entered Parliament at a by-election in 1931, and was one of a handful of Labour front-benchers to retain his seat in the general election that autumn. He became a leading spokesman for the left and cooperation in a Popular Front with Communists before 1939, in which year he was expelled from the Labour Party. During World War II he served as Ambassador to the USSR (1940–42), during which time he grew wary of the Soviet Union, but achieved great public popularity because of the entry of the USSR into the war, causing him to be seen in 1942 as a potential rival to Churchill for the premiership. He became a member of the War Cabinet of the wartime coalition, but failed in his efforts (the \"Cripps Mission\") to resolve the wartime crisis in India, where his proposals were too radical for Churchill and the cabinet, and too conservative for Gandhi and other Indian leaders. He later served as Minister of Aircraft Production, an important post but outside the inner War Cabinet. Rejoining the Labour Party in 1945, after the war he served in the Attlee Ministry, firstly as President of the Board of Trade and between 1947 and 1950 as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the latter position, Cripps was responsible for laying the foundations of Britain’s post-war economic prosperity, and was, according to historian Kenneth O. Morgan, “the real architect of the rapidly improving economic picture and growing affluence from 1952 onwards.” The economy improved after 1947, benefiting from the American money given through the Marshall Plan, but was hurt by the forced devaluation of the pound in 1949. He kept rationing in place to hold down consumption during an \"age of austerity,\" promoted exports, and maintained full employment with static wages. The public especially respected \"his integrity, competence, and Christian principles.\"",

According to commentator Stephen Vines, the Chinese central government appointed Szeto to the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee because they appreciated his political significance, even though they disliked his ideas. Aside from his political career, Szeto was also well known for his Chinese calligraphy skills. He was referred to as \"Uncle Wah\" (華叔) by Hong Kong people.",

His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On March 9, 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party.",

His career, aside from politics, consisted of speaking publicly to youth across Canada about his life and writing about his own experiences on such topics as drugs and violence. LeClerc graduated from the University of Waterloo with an honours degree in sociology with a minor in social work, and with a social work diploma. He was an associate member of all of the Crime Stoppers chapters in Saskatchewan, and the founder and past director of Teen Challenge Saskatchewan. LeClerc also spoke against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, stating that it puts the rights of the individual (criminal) over the rights of society as a whole. He was elected to represent the electoral district of Saskatoon Northwest in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the 2007 election, as a member of the Saskatchewan Party.",

Barghouti at one time supported the peace process, but later became disillusioned, and after 2000 went on to become a leader of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in the West Bank. Barghouti is said to have founded Tanzim. He has been called by some \"the Palestinian Mandela\". Israeli authorities have called Barghouti a terrorist, accusing him of directing numerous attacks, including suicide bombings, against civilian and military targets alike. Barghouti was arrested by Israel Defense Forces in 2002 in Ramallah. He was tried and convicted on charges of murder, and sentenced to five life sentences. Marwan Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate. Barghouti still exerts great influence in Fatah from within prison. With popularity reaching further than that, there has been some speculation whether he could be a unifying candidate in a bid to succeed Mahmud Abbas. In the negotiations over the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for the captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Hamas insisted on including Barghouti in the deal with Israel. However, Israel was unwilling to concede to that demand and despite initial reports that he indeed was to be released in the 11 October deal between Israel and Hamas, it was soon denied by Israeli sources. In November 2014, Barghouti urged the Palestinian Authority to immediately end security cooperation with Israel and called for a Third Intifada against Israel.",

After graduating from the University of Tokyo with the B.L. degree, she became a lawyer in 1987. She is the deputy head of the SDP, vice-chairperson of the Socialist International (SI), the Visiting Professor of Gakushuin Women's College. Fukushima was also Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety, Social Affairs, and Gender Equality in Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's cabinet (16 September 2009 – 28 May 2010); the SDP was the junior partner in the DPJ-led government coalition. However, in May 2010 disagreements over the issue of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on Friday May 28, and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition. Fukushima's Social Democratic Party has an anti-nuclear platform, and she has been referred to as a prominent anti-nuclear activist. For three decades, she was at the forefront of an often futile fight against the utilities that operated Japan's nuclear reactors, the corporations that built them and the bureaucrats who enabled them. That situation changed with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011. She has opposed capital punishment on the SDP website. After a disappointing result in the 2013 election for the House of Councillors she announced her resignation as head of the party.",

  "text" : "Major James William Coldwell, PC CC (December 2, 1888 – August 25, 1974), usually known as M.J. (Major was his first name, not a military title), was a Canadian social democratic politician, and leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) party from 1942 to 1960. He was born in England, and immigrated to Canada in 1910. Prior to his political career, he was an educator and union activist. In 1935 he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, representing the Rosetown—Biggar electoral district. He would be re-elected five more times until he was defeated in the 1958 Diefenbaker sweep. He was the CCF's first national secretary in 1934, and became its national leader upon the death of J. S. Woodsworth in 1942. He remained as its leader until 1960, when there was a parliamentary caucus revolt against him. When the CCF was disbanded 1961, he joined its successor party, the NDP. He is mainly remembered for helping to introduce \"welfare state\" policies to Canada, by persuading the Canadian government to introduce an Old Age Security programme, and child benefits during the mid-1940s. Coldwell turned down several offers to cross the floor and join the governing Liberal Party of Canada, including one offer that eventually would have made him the Prime Minister of Canada. After his defeat in 1958, he was offered a Senate appointment, but declined it as well. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1964 and in 1967 became one of the initial inductees into the Order of Canada. After suffering two heart attacks on the same day, he died in Ottawa at the age of 85.",

Bridgman was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 1997, representing the Canadian, federal electoral district of Surrey North in Surrey, British Columbia. Born in Kimberley, British Columbia, she was elected to Parliament for Surrey North in the 1993 election as a candidate of the Reform Party of Canada. In 2001, Bridgman unsuccessfully ran for the Reform Party of British Columbia in the riding of Surrey-Newton. Before entering politics, Brigdman was a police constable, a nurse, and a nurse administrator. As a young woman, Bridgman lived and worked in London as a police constable (traffic bobby). Subsequently, she trained in London as a psychiatric nurse, becoming a Registered Nurse (RN) and a Psychiatric Nurse (PN) before returning to Canada. Bridgman went on to earn the Director of Nursing designation from the University of Saskatchewan, rising to become a nurse administrator. In September 1993, the designated Reform Party candidate for Surrey North resigned his nomination. Bridgman was President of the Surrey North Reform Party Constituency Association, and she was selected to run as the Reform Party candidate. On October 25, 1993, Margaret Bridgman was elected the Member of Parliament for Surrey North, unseating the incumbent with a plurality of 6413 votes. Prior to Bridgman's landmark victory, Surrey North and its predecessor ridings had been held either by the New Democratic Party or the Progressive Conservative Party since 1958. Bridgman served as the Reform Party Critic on Health and Assistant Critic on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. She sat as the Reform Party member of the House of Commons Standing Committees on Health and on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, during the 35th Parliament. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons, Bridgman focused on the need for more effective and cost-conscious funding of health care in Canada. Bridgman's interventions in the House of Commons ranged from remarks on health care and Indian Affairs to young offenders, old age security, and the spending priorities of the Canadian parliament. In 1997, Bridgman was successfully challenged for the Reform Party nomination by Chuck Cadman. Bridgman opted not to run as an independent in the 1997 general election, and she did not run, again, in a federal, electoral race. Following the 1997 election, Bridgman returned to nursing in Surrey, British Columbia. After a sustained battle with lung cancer, Margaret Bridgman died at home on January 4, 2009.",

Er wurde auch in das Bankwesen einbezogen und hatte aktiven Anteil an der Gründung der Newark Library Association. 1860 wurde er als Delegierter zur Republican National Convention geschickt, vier Jahre darauf bekleidete er dieses Amt erneut. Ein Jahr später, am 7. November 1865, wurde der Republikaner zum Gouverneur gewählt; die vorherige Wahl hatte er noch gegen Joel Parker verloren. Während seiner Amtszeit sorgte er sich vor allem um die Verbesserung der Zustände in den Gefängnissen des Bundesstaates. Von 1866 bis 1868 stand er dem Republican National Committee vor, der Parteiorganisation der Republikaner. Nach seiner Amtszeit als Gouverneur entschied sich Ward, weiterhin als Politiker aktiv zu bleiben. 1873 gewann er die Wahl zum Abgeordneten des US-Repräsentantenhauses. Dieses Mandat behielt er zwei Jahre lang inne; ein Wiederwahlversuch scheiterte. Er starb 1884 und wurde auf dem Mount-Pleasant-Friedhof begraben.",

  "text" : "Marcelle Mersereau, (born February 14, 1942 in Pointe-Verte, New Brunswick) is a Canadian politician. A civil servant for most of her career, she also served as a councillor on Bathurst, New Brunswick city council while on the provincial payroll from 1980 to 1991. She resigned her seat on council upon being elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1991 provincial election. A member of Frank McKenna's Liberal Party, she was immediately named to cabinet and became deputy premier in 1994. She served in a variety of roles in cabinet until the defeat of the Liberals in the 1999 election. She defeated PC candidate Robert N. Stairs to retain her seat in Bathurst, one of only 10 Liberals to survive what was their worst ever electoral defeat. In opposition she was a top critic and the media reported she had lost the vote in her caucus to become interim leader of her party by a margin of 4-3 following the resignation of Camille Thériault. Her most high-profile role in opposition was that of finance critic. She did not seek re-election to the legislature in 2003 but has remained active in her party. She was elected vice president of the New Brunswick Liberal Association on October 4, 2003 and re-elected on October 15, 2005. During the 2004 federal election, she was co-chair of the Liberal campaign in New Brunswick. She was the Liberal candidate for the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Acadie—Bathurst in the 2006 federal election, but finished second to Yvon Godin of the New Democratic Party. She served as co-chair of the successful Liberal campaign as it prepared for the 2006 provincial election. She succeeded Greg Byrne as president of the New Brunswick Liberal Party when he resigned after being appointed to the cabinet following the 2006 election and served the post until stepping down in the Fall of 2007.",

At the 2010 Federal election she lost her seat to the Liberal Party candidate, John Alexander. Before entering politics, McKew was an award-winning broadcast journalist. She hosted a number of programmes on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television and radio, most recently Lateline and The 7.30 Report.",

  "text" : "Michael Di Biase is a Regional Councillor in (and the former mayor of) Vaughan, Ontario, an exurb of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was first elected to the city's council in 1986. Following the death of Mayor Lorna Jackson in 2002, Di Biase was appointed acting mayor by virtue of his position as senior regional councilor (a position he had held since 1988). In the 2003 municipal election, Di Biase won his first official term as mayor. The Globe and Mail newspaper reports that Di Biase received an annual salary of $164,074, making him one of the highest-paid municipal politicians in the country. The next highest paid mayor is Hazel McCallion of Mississauga at $158,704. The mayor of the largest city in Canada, David Miller of Toronto, receives $143,635 per year. The average salary of Vaughan councilors is $102,657 which is second to that of Mississauga at $113,296, while Toronto councilors earn $85,497. In the 2006 municipal election, Di Biase faced Lorna Jackson's daughter Linda Jackson and lost by 90 votes in one of the closest races of the night. After a court-ordered recount completed on April 26, 2007, which had been initiated by Di Biase, it was confirmed that Jackson had indeed won the election. Di Biase has stated he will accept the results. In 2006, he was made a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit by the Government of Italy. In September 2009, an audit was conducted on former Mayor DiBiase's 2006 election campaign. 27 contraventions were revealed in the audit. The largest notable contravention was a $155,000 cash payment made to DiBiase's law firm to pay for legal expenses. DiBiase refused to name the anonymous donor(s), citing lawyer privilege, and was eventually cleared of wrongdoing. He was elected Local and Regional Councillor for the City of Vaughan in October 2010. His term began December 1, 2010. In July, 2011, an auditing committee voted to examine expenses relating to DiBiase's 2010 campaign. It is alleged that due to improper reporting and accounting procedures on DiBiase's part, he improperly kept $32,000 in campaign funds that should have been returned to the city. In April 2015 Vaughan city's integrity commissioner concluded that Di Biase directed \"abusive language\" and \"intimidating actions\" at city staff who resisted his efforts to get confidential information from them about the bidding process for two major construction contracts. Commissioner recommended Vaughan council vote to suspend Di Biase's salary for 90 days, the highest penalty allowed for a code of conduct infraction under the provincial Municipal Act. \"I find that the respondent applied inappropriate pressure to staff with a view to exercising influence or assisting [Maystar General Contractors] with the business of the municipality,\" city's integrity commissioner wrote.",

He was Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2009 till 2015 and deputy president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the main component party of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition from 2009 till 2016. Muhyiddin grew up in the state of Johor and joined the state public service after graduating from university. He later took up management positions at various state-owned companies. He joined politics in the 1970s and was elected as Member of Parliament for Pagoh in 1978. During his term as MP, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Federal Territories and later Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry. As Johor UMNO chief, he was Menteri Besar of Johor from 1986 to 1995. He returned to federal politics in 1995 and was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of Youth and Sports. He was appointed Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs after the 1999 general election and became a vice-president of UMNO in 2000. Under the premiership of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Muhyiddin served as Minister of Agriculture (2004–2008) and then Minister of International Trade and Industry (2008–2009). In 2008, he contested and won the UMNO deputy presidency and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education by Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009. As Education Minister, Muhyiddin ended the use of English as the medium of instruction for science and mathematics in public schools. He also attracted controversy after describing himself as \"Malay first\" when challenged by the opposition to pronounce himself as \"Malaysian first.\" During Najib's mid-term Cabinet reshuffle in July 2015, he was dropped from his position, marking the first incumbent to be left out; in June 2016 he was further sacked from UMNO.",

  "text" : "Mavroudis „Makis“ Voridis (griechisch Μαυρουδής “Μάκης” Βορίδης, * 1964 in Athen) ist ein griechischer Rechtsanwalt und Politiker. Der ehemalige Anführer, Vorsitzende und Gründungsmitglied mehrerer rechtsextremer Gruppen und Parteien war Verkehrsminister der Übergangsregierung Papadimos für die rechtspopulistische LA.O.S. Nach seinem Wechsel zur konservativen Nea Dimokratia 2012 übernahm Voridis deren Fraktionsvorsitz im griechischen Parlament, zuletzt war er Gesundheitsminister im Kabinett Samaras. Makis Voridis hat ein Studium an der Universität London mit dem Titel Magister der Rechte abgeschlossen. Als Jugendlicher war er in der faschistischen Studentengruppe Eleftheri Mathites (Ελεύθεροι Μαθητές ‚Freie Schüler‘) am Athens College aktiv. Voridis übernahm 1985 von Nikolaos Michaloliakos die Jugendführung der nationalistischen EPEN, die sich für die Freilassung der Junta-Offiziere und die Rückkehr des Königs einsetzte. Nach Voridis’ Ansicht standen diese Parteiziele einer Modernisierung entgegen, deshalb gründete er 1994 die rechtsgerichtete Elliniko Metopo nach dem Vorbild seines Freundes Jean-Marie Le Pen und war deren Vorsitzender. Zwei Mal - 1998 und 2002 - war Voridis Kandidat für das Amt des Athener Oberbürgermeisters. Die Elliniko Metopo verfügte über enge Verbindungen zur französischen Front National. Voridis, unterhielt persönliche Kontakte zu Le Pen und Carl Lang. Die gesamte Parteiführung wechselte im Herbst 2005 zur LA.O.S-Partei. Nach der Parlamentswahl 2007 war Voridis bis 2009 Abgeordneter für die erstmals im griechischen Parlament vertretene LA.O.S-Partei. In der Übergangsregierung Papadimos war er vom 11. November 2011 bis 17. Mai 2012 Minister für Infrastruktur, Verkehr und Netzwerke. Nach dem Ausscheiden der LA.O.S aus der Regierung im Februar 2012 trat er zur Nea Dimokratia über. Seit der Parlamentswahl im Mai 2012 war Voridis Abgeordneter der Nea Dimokratia und übernahm nach der Parlamentswahl im Juni 2012 den Fraktionsvorsitz. Vom 10. Juni 2014 bis 26. Januar 2015 war Voridis Gesundheitsminister im Kabinett Samaras.",

She was the first woman elected to the House of Commons from Manitoba. She was the daughter of Robert Arthur Rogers, a businessman, and Edith Rogers, the first woman ever elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. She married Gordon Konantz in 1922. During World War II, Margaret Konantz was an active volunteer for the Patriotic Salvage Corps, Bundles for Britain and the Women's Volunteer Services. In 1944, she was one of four women sent to Great Britain by the Canadian government to work with the Women's Voluntary Service. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire posthumously for her volunteer work in the war effort. Following the death of her husband in 1954, she volunteered for UNICEF, travelling to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, The Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Rhodesia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and the United Arab Republic on behalf of the organization. She originally stood as the Liberal candidate for Winnipeg South in the 1962 election, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative incumbent Gordon Chown. When the minority government of John Diefenbaker fell the following year, however, Konantz defeated Chown in the 1963 election. In 1964 she was the only woman on a committee of 15 MPs selected by Prime Minister Lester Pearson to choose a new flag for Canada. She served as an MP until the 1965 election, when she was defeated by new Progressive Conservative candidate Bud Sherman. Also in 1963, she was a delegate to the United Nations Third Committee on Social, Economic and Humanitarian Problems. In this capacity, she toured a number of Indian reserves in Canada to study economic and health conditions. Following her electoral defeat in 1965, she became national chair for UNICEF Canada. She undertook several further international tours until her death in 1967.",

Mulla Effendi was born into a respected and intellectual family of Islamic scholars who settled in Arbil in the 16th century and spent most of their life learning and teaching Islamic studies at the Great Mosque at the Citadel of Arbil. His family was well known for their piety and learning and influential throughout Kurdistan for hundred years before him. After being educated at the Great Mosque, Mulla Effendi like his ancestors spent most of his time teaching and learning there. During his life he granted more than hundred scientific licenses for scholars from different parts of Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East in general, and sponsored the daily living and study costs of his students. He also contributed to establishing many schools and mosques in Arbil and in many different villages. He became one of the most influential figures in Kurdistan in the late 19th century and until his death. He had an important role in disengaging tribal conflicts during the Ottoman rule where he received the highest recognition by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II.Throughout the British Mandate and after the creation of Iraq, he played a prominent role in inspiring and directing public opinion, as well as being deeply involved in the political process of the region. In 1924, he strongly urged appending Mosul Wilayah to Iraq in his meeting with the members of the League of Nations commission. He also advocated for the rights of the Christian inhabitants of Ankawa. In the events of 1941, the Iraqi royal family chose his house as the most suitable and safe for their stay, and when King Faisal II returned, he awarded him \"Wisam al-Rafidain\" of the first order as a reward for his services for his country. He also received many honors and tributes both during and after his life.",

At this time, Strauss became more identified with the regional politics of Bavaria. While he ran for the chancellorship as the candidate of the CDU/CSU in 1980, for the rest of his life Strauss never again held federal office. From 1978 until his death in 1988, he was the head of the Bavarian government. His last two decades were also marked by a fierce rivalry with CDU chairman Helmut Kohl.",

Hague has a widely known reputation for corruption and bossism and has been called \"the grandaddy of Jersey bosses.\" By the time he left office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the Plaza Hotel. His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million at the time of his death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income. His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his \"guests\" to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash. However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallinan, the drawers were a traditional feature of 19th century partners desks and that \"[t]he last thing [Hague] would need to do is take a bribe personally.\" As of September 2013, the desk was in storage awaiting restoration. During the height of his power Hague's political machine, known as \"the organization,\" was one of the most powerful in the United States controlling politics on local, county, and state levels. Hague's personal influence extended to the national level, influencing federal patronage  and presidential campaigns.",

  "text" : "Dr. Francisco Epigmenio Luna Kan (born December 3, 1925) is a Mexican politician. Francisco Luna Kan was governor of the state of Yucatán from 1976 to 1982. Born in Mérida, Yucatán, he was a practicing doctor of medicine then taught as a Professor of Medicine before first obtaining political office, at first being overseer of the state's rural medical system. Francisco Luna Kan was the first person of pure Maya ancestry to govern Yucatán since the Spanish conquest of Yucatán. (In the early 1920s, Felipe Carrillo Puerto, who was partly Maya, had been governor.) For centuries the political elite had been Criollos (Yucatecans of pure Spanish ancestry). It was widely said that party officials of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took the unusual step of selecting a person of Maya descent as their candidate in 1975 because the opposition National Action Party had been getting many votes in Yucatán, and PRI candidates had been getting a poor showing in the state's predominantly Maya towns and villages. It was said that PAN got the majority of votes in the previous governor's race, and the PRI managed to maintain control of the state only through fraud in counting votes. Shortly after his election Luna Kan was subjected to an unpleasant incident while taking a train to Mexico City for a governmental conference. Luna Kan was thrown off the train, as the railroad conductors thought it inconceivable that this short man of obvious Native American features was telling the truth when he claimed to be a state governor. After his term as governor Luna Kan resigned from the PRI and joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). He unsuccessfully ran as that party's candidate for mayor of Mérida in 1998. As of 2004 Francisco Luna Kan holds a seat in Mexico's Chamber of Deputies of Mexico as a PRD deputy for Yucatán.",

He was the founder of Hanly's Flying Squadron, which advocated prohibition nationally and played an important role in raising awareness about the effect of alcohol and arousing public support for prohibition. During his term as governor he successfully advocated the passage of a local-option liquor law, which led the majority of Indiana's counties to ban liquor sales. His other achievements included banning gambling, fighting political corruption, and adjusting state agencies to operate on a non-partisan basis. He left office and the Republican Party and became an active and vocal prohibitionist. He was an unsuccessful Prohibition Party candidate for President of the United States in the 1916 election.",

He was one of close to forty former British Empire officials to oppose the Malayan Union. Swettenham co-authored a \"A Dictionary of the Malay Language\" with Hugh Clifford. The dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter 'G' as by then it had been made redundant by the publiciation of R.J. Wilkinson's \"A Malay English Dictionary\". He also published four books \"Malay Sketches\", \"Unaddressed Letters\", \"Also & Perhaps\" and \"Arabella in Africa\", the latter being illustrated by the famous mural painter and illustrator, Rex Whistler.

  "text" : "Sir Thomas Frederick Halsey, 1st Baronet PC (9 December 1839 – 12 February 1927) was an English Conservative Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1874 to 1906. Halsey came from one of the most prominent families of Hertfordshire, whose seat was at Gaddesden Place, near Hemel Hempstead. He was the son of Thomas Plumer Halsey and his wife Frederica Johnston, daughter of General F. Johnston. His father was Member of Parliament (MP) for Hertfordshire from 1847 until he was drowned with his wife and his younger son in the shipwreck of the steamer Ercolano in the Gulf of Genoa on 24 April 1854. Frederick Halsey was at Eton at the time. He progressed from there to Christ Church, Oxford. He rowed in the losing Oxford eight in the Boat Race in 1860. After graduating in 1861, Halsey took up the life of a county notable in Hertfordshire, obtaining a commission in the North Hertfordshire Yeomanry and becoming a Justice of the Peace. He was chairman of the Gaddesden School Board. At the 1874 general election Halsey was elected Conservative MP for Hertfordshire and served in the post until 1885, when the constituencies were reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. the 1885 general election he was elected for Watford. He was also an alderman of Hertfordshire County Council from 1888, and was particularly interested in the Hertfordshire Constabulary. He served as deputy chairman of the St Albans Quarter Sessions from 1889 to 1908. In 1899 he was elected Chairman of the House of Commons Standing Orders Committee (and the added chairmanship of the Committee of Selection), and for service in this role was appointed to the Privy Council after the accession of King Edward VII on 24 January 1901, entitling him to the style \"The Right Honourable\". Halsey held his seat until 1906, when he lost to the Liberal candidate Nathaniel Micklem. After his parliamentary defeat he once more devoted himself to county affairs, serving as chairman of the St Albans Quarter Sessions from 1908 to 1918. No decision of his court was ever appealed. He finally retired from the Hertfordshire Yeomanry with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, having served as second-in-command, and then joined the county Territorial Force association, becoming its chairman. He was an active Freemason, and served as Deputy Grand Master of England and Second Grand Principal of the Supreme Grand Chapter of the Royal Arch from 1903. In December 1908, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire. He was created a baronet on 22 June 1920, in the 1920 Birthday Honours. Halsey lived at Gaddesden Place, Hemel Hempstead. He died at the age of 87. Halsey married Mary Julia Wells in 1865. His fourth son was Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey.",

  "text" : "George Lansbury, PC (22 February 1859 – 7 May 1940) was a British politician and social reformer who led the Labour Party from 1932 to 1935. Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929–31, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of social justice, women's rights and world disarmament. Originally a radical Liberal, Lansbury converted to socialism in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to parliament in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women's suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action. In 1912 Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution. These positions contributed to Lansbury's failure to be elected to parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar, and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in the Poplar \"rates revolt\" of 1921. After his return to parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931 Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but stayed with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the party's leader. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 party conference he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.",

Appointed to the Canadian Senate representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102. Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques. In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record. Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday. His daughter Henriette Dessaulles became a noted writer and journalist.",

  "text" : "George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579 – 15 April 1632) was an English politician and coloniser. He achieved domestic political success as a Member of Parliament and later Secretary of State under King James I. He lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between Prince Charles and the Spanish House of Habsburg royal family. Rather than continue in politics, he resigned all of his political offices in 1625 except for his position on the Privy Council and declared his Catholicism publicly. He was created Baron Baltimore in the Irish peerage upon his resignation. Baltimore Manor was located in County Longford, Ireland. The name Baltimore is an Anglicisation of the Irish Baile an Tí Mhóir, which means \"town of the big house.\" Calvert took an interest in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, Sir George looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil, (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert, (1606–1647), was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.",

  "text" : "George Henry Williams (March 26, 1823 – April 4, 1910) was an American judge and politician. He served as Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon's U.S. Senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the Virginius, a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C. Gibbs United States District Attorney at Portland, Oregon. In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General under the controversy of his wife allegedly taking payment money from the custom house firm Pratt & Boyd in order to drop litigation by the U.S. Justice Department. After his resignation, Williams took part in counting Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes in settling the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland's mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams advocated women's suffrage and that marriage and divorce proceedings needed to be handled by the civil courts rather than the church. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted while Mayor of Portland for not enforcing gambling restriction statutes; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor. On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Williams was the second to last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration.",

Currently, he is the founder and president of Pillitteri Estates Winery in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Pillitteri is a member of the Liberal party who first bid for the Niagara Falls electoral district in 1988. He lost to Conservative candidate Rob Nicholson in that election by a narrow margin of only 1,940 votes. After a second attempt in the 1993 general election, he defeated Nicholson by 10,823 votes and joined the federal Parliament and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. He therefore served in the 35th, 36th and 37th Canadian Parliaments. Pillitteri is currently the longest serving consecutive Member of Parliament the Niagara Falls riding has ever had. Pillitteri left federal politics in 2004 and did not seek a fourth term in federal office. Rob Nicholson decided to put his name forward to run as the Conservative candidate in the next election only once he learned that Pillitteri had retired. Nicholson regained the riding that year.",

Addley was first elected to the Legislature in 1999, and served as Deputy Speaker and chair of the Committee of the Whole from May 2001 to October 2005. He co-authored \"Press Councils and Democracy\" which he presented to the 41st Canadian Regional Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in New Brunswick in July 2002 and was subsequently published in the Parliamentary Review. Appointed in 2000 to the All Party Committee on Tobacco Control, Addley was instrumental in developing recommendations which transformed Saskatchewan's approach to tobacco control including the precedent setting tobacco display ban which eliminated the last legal avenue for tobacco companies to advertise to children. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 in Saskatchewan's favour, the law was emulated across the country and around the world. In 2006 the Lung Association of Saskatchewan presented Addley its Award of Merit for outstanding service in promoting lung health in Saskatchewan. Appointed Legislative Secretary to the Premier on Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment in January 2005, his \"Healthy Choices in a Healthy Community Report\" resulted in the Premier's Project Hope strategy which was honoured by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) for leadership and commitment to the field of addiction. In October 2005 Addley was appointed to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Healthy Living Services and Minister Responsible for Seniors. In May 2007 his Cabinet duties were expanded to include Minister Responsible for Investment Saskatchewan Inc. and Minister Responsible for Information Services Corporation of Saskatchewan.

  "text" : "Greg J. Curtis (born October 18, 1960) is a Lobbyist and Attorney from Utah. He is married to Teresa Curtis and the father of six children and eight grandchildren. A Republican, he is a former member of the Utah State House. He formerly represented the state's 49th house district in Sandy and Cottonwood Heights. He formerly served as the Speaker of the House. Curtis was first elected to the State Legislature in 1994, defeating a fellow Republican in the primary. Curtis grew up in his district in Sandy and served a two-year LDS mission to New Zealand. He has worked for a private law firm; as a prosecutor for West Jordan City; and as staff counsel for County Mayor Nancy Workman. Curtis graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in accounting and then received a law degree from the University of Utah. Beginning in October 2008, Curtis was plagued by accusations from several former state employees who claimed that Curtis abused his government position to benefit his legal clients financially. One of these former employees, Doug Clark, claimed that Curtis cut funding and caused layoffs to anyone who opposed his plans to build a public transit facility in the midst of an ancient Native American settlement in Draper, Utah. Changing the location of the proposed facility would have kept land owners in the area from moving forward with subsequent development plans. Clark said that Curtis told him, *“Doug, I am the speaker of the House. If I want something, I get it. ... I want you to talk to DNR to figure out a way to get that road through there. I know this may sound a little strange. You may think it is unethical — because it probably is — because effectively I’m asking you as a state employee to work for me and do work for my law client.” On November 4, 2008, Curtis became the first sitting Speaker of the House in Utah to fail to win re-election in 40 years. Democrat Jay Seegmiller won by over 10% - nearly 1,400 votes. With this result, it became apparent that the public was fed up with Curtis's alleged abuse of power. For the 2009 legislative session, Curtis returned to Utah's Capitol Hill - not as a state representative - but as a lobbyist representing several large companies, including Intermountain Healthcare, UTA, Altria Group, parent company of Philip Morris.",

Inácio Henrique de Gouveia, Graciano dos Santos Neves e Galdino Teixeira de Barros Loreto foram indicados pelo Partido Republicano Construtor para assumir o governo provisoriamente, até as eleições de um novo presidente, que viria a ser José de Melo Carvalho Muniz Freire, em 3 de maio de 1892. Quatro anos depois, em 23 de maio de 1896, assumiu novamente a presidência do estado, agora mediante eleição direta. Renunciou porém ao cargo em 23 de setembro de 1897, desapontado com os rumos da política. Escreveu um livro com o título A Doutrina do Engrossamento, versando ironicamente sobre a bajulação entre políticos, com o único propósito da auto-promoção, e quanto isto o desapontou, baseado em sua experiência como interventor e presidente do Espírito Santo.

  "text" : "Gordon St. Angelo (June 20, 1927 - October 18, 2011) born in Huntingburg, Indiana, USA is former Democratic Party State Chairman of the state of Indiana and was a prominent politician during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Gordon was born on June 20, 1927 to George and Lillian (Salat) St. Angelo in Huntingburg, Indiana. He served in the Navy at the end of World War II. He then attended North Central College, where he was active in student politics. He there met his future wife Beatrice Mae Larson, who was from Watertown, South Dakota. Gordon became active in Democratic Party politics in 1954. He was elected Dubois County Chairman in 1958. An early key supporter of then Senator John F. Kennedy, he became 8th District Chairman in 1960. St. Angelo worked on two presidential campaigns including holding the position of National Co-Chairman of Humphrey for President Committee. He was also manager of Roger Branigin's successful campaign for the governorship of Indiana in 1964. After managing the campaign of Governor Roger D. Branigan in 1964, Gordon was elected state Democratic Party Chairman, a position he held until 1974. His tenure was longer than that of any party chairman in Indiana. From 1974 to 1996, he was Vice-President of Community Development for the Lilly Endowment, and during this time was a vocal proponent for the development of free market economies in North and South America. Gordon's political reach extended beyond the state. He was Deputy Democratic Party National Chairman from June to November, 1968, when he helped manage the Hubert Humphrey presidential campaign. In 1974 Gordon left politics to become Senior Program Officer of community development at the Lilly Endowment, where he loved working for twenty three years. There he was instrumental in expanding the role of non-profits in public policy, with many positive civil- and individual-rights implications. His building of coalitions between non-profit think tanks was instrumental in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1973, he ran for National Democratic Party chairman, being narrowly defeated by Larry O'Brien. Gordon also served on the boards of the University of Indianapolis (1965-1993), St. Meinrad College, WFYI, the United Way, the Welfare Service League, the State Employment Commission, the Indiana Division of the National Civil Rights Commission, and the Indianapolis 500 Festival Committee. Starting with his work at the Lilly Endowment, Gordon and Beatty took special interest in historic New Harmony, Indiana which they visited often. He was appointed by Governor Evan Bayh to the New Harmony Commission and served on the board of the Robert Lee Blaffer Foundation until his death (Chairman, 1995-2006). He received honorary doctorates from the University of Indianapolis and the University of Southern Indiana. He received \"Sagamore of the Wabash\" awards for his service to Indiana from Governors Welsh, Branigan, Whitcomb, Bowen, Orr, Bayh and Daniels. In 1996, St. Angelo helped create a foundation with Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman and his wife, Rose Friedman to promote and help establish educational choice in America. He served as President & CEO of the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation for School Choice until 2009. He was succeeded by Robert Enlow. Though he started his career in the Democratic party, he was a supporter of many Republican candidates since the mid-seventies. For example, he endorsed Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, a Republican, for both of his gubernatorial campaigns. St. Angelo died on October 18, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana.",

  "text" : "Peter Ernest Hume (born June 19, 1963) was a city councillor in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He represented Alta Vista Ward in the south end of the city. He was considered by some to have been \"the most respected politician in Ottawa\". Hume grew up in the Canterbury area of Alta Vista Ward. He attended Hawthorne Public School and Canterbury High School before graduating with a degree in Economics from Carleton University. He would then work as an assistant to Canterbury Ward councillor Michael McSweeney and then Alta Vista Ward councillor Darrel Kent. Hume was first elected as a city and regional councillor in 1991. In 1994 he was elected to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton council (when it became an independently elected position). He was re-elected in 1997. In the 2000 Ottawa election, he chose to run against Ottawa city councillor Allan Higdon for city council, as the City of Ottawa and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton were set to amalgamate the following year. He was able to defeat Higdon, and was acclaimed three years later in the 2003 Ottawa election. In 2002, Hume contributed $362.26 to the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership campaign of Jim Flaherty. Hume is generally considered to be a \"red Tory\", who \"votes in favour of social spending, but talks convincingly about fiscal responsibility.\" In 2004, Hume allowed a private developer to hold a private party to raise money to pay off a debt Hume had received from running for President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Both Hume and the host of the party has refused to reveal the guest list to that event. Hume would later serve as President from 2008 to 2011. Hume was easily re-elected in the 2006 municipal elections with 70% of the vote and again in 2010 with 59% of the vote. Hume is currently the Chair of the City of Ottawa's Planning Committee, a position he has held since 2003. On August 22, 2014, Hume announced he would not be seeking re-election as councillor. In 2015, Hume partnered with former Minto vice-president, Jack Stirling, in a \"strategic partnership to pursue development projects and to advise both the private and public sector.\" Stirling, the old City of Nepean’s last planning commissioner before amalgamation, is well-known as another former local bureaucrat who jumped the fence in 2001 to work for Minto as vice-president of development, using his experience to stickhandle development proposals through the city’s Byzantine approvals process.",

He studied social sciences in Moscow. He returned to Cyprus in the 1930s and had to sign a declaration saying he would not be involved in politics in order to be allowed to set foot in the country. He became the general secretary of the illegal Communist party of Cyprus and founder and first general secretary of AKEL (1941–1945). He was also the first elected Mayor of Limassol 1943–1946 and 1946–1949. As a mayor he participated in the consultative assembly and advocated accepting the British plan of self-government for Cyprus in 1948. For that opinion he became isolated within his party and was expelled in 1952. He supported Ioannis Clerides in the 1960 elections, but wasn't an active politician again himself. He worked mainly as a reporter and a writer. He wrote books such as: Spain on Fire (1936), The Labour Issue (1936), AKEL and Local Issues (1942), Portraits of Palmer's Era (1946), Corea (1949), Prague Spring (1973), How Did We Manage to Get to Zero; The Cypriot Tragedy (1975), Old and New China (1977), Responsibilities (first volume 1980, second volume 1984, third volume 1985). His death on 14 February 2001 caused controversy in Cyprus as in his will he had asked to be cremated. There were no crematoria in Cyprus and there was a heated debate between those supporting the availability of cremation as an alternative and those (mainly religious Orthodox Christians) who disapproved of it.",

Kline, a member of the Republican Party, lost re-election as attorney general to Democratic challenger, Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison, on November 7, 2006, 58%-41%. Having been appointed by the Republican County Central Committee over Steve Howe to fill the vacancy left by Paul Morrison's election as Kansas Attorney General, Kline became the district attorney of Johnson County on the day he left office as attorney general, essentially switching jobs with Morrison. Kline then ran for a full term as district attorney, but was defeated by Howe in the August 5, 2008, Republican primary. On October 18, 2013, Kline's Kansas law license was indefinitely suspended by the Kansas Supreme Court, which held in a written opinion that there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Kline committed 11 violations of conduct rules while he was the state's top law enforcement officer from January 2003 to January 2007 and later as Johnson County's District Attorney. While in office, Kline served as Chairman of the Republican Attorneys' General Association, Co-Chairman of the National Violent Sexual Predator Apprehension Task Force, President of the Midwest Association of Attorneys General, Prosecutor of the Year for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill and Executive Committee Member of the National Association of Attorneys General. Kline was a polarizing figure in state politics, largely surrounding the issue of abortion. He filed charges against Dr. George Tiller, a late-term abortion provider, and led a years-long effort to prosecute Planned Parenthood in Kansas, which he said had failed to submit reports when young women (15 and younger) came to get abortions.",

He is the only person to hold to every elected seat in the state government under the 1816 constitution. His brief term as governor was marked by the calling of a state constitutional convention and overshadowed by the national anti-slavery debate, where Dunning urged state leaders to issue and forward resolutions to Congress expressing opposition to the expansion of slavery. As a delegate to the subsequent convention, he successfully advocated legislative and educational reform. As the American Civil War broke out, he left the Democratic party and declared for the Union, personally raising many companies of soldiers for the war effort. He returned to the state senate during the war, and then resumed his law practice after his term ended. He remained popular in the state, and declined several nominations to run for office after retiring from politics.",

He was born in Östergötland and was at one time chairman of the Moderate Youth League district there. He studied law in Uppsala 1968–71. In 1971, he was elected national chairman of the Moderate Youth League and served until 1976, when he was elected to the Riksdag for Östergötland. In 1986, he became secretary general of the Moderate Party. He stayed in the post until 1991, when the Moderate Party won the election and Carl Bildt became Prime Minister of Sweden. Unckel was then appointed Minister of Education. In that position, he spearheaded the educational reforms that revolutionised the Swedish education system. Among other things, students were allowed to choose among the local schools. After the loss in the election in 1994, Unckel became the party spokesman on labour policy. In 1998 he became chairman of the Committee on the Constitution and one year later he was appointed leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group. The election in 2002 was disastrous for the Moderate Party and several senior figures had to resign from the board of the party. Per Unckel was one of them. He was seen as a part of the old regime - the so-called \"Bunker\" around Carl Bildt, together with the likes of Anders Björk and Gunnar Hökmark. His old Moderate Youth League district, however, paid their respects by electing him honorary chairman. In 2003, he was appointed secretary-general of the Nordic Council of Ministers and retired from Swedish politics. He served until December 2006. He later served as the Chairman of the Governing Board of the European Humanities University. Unckel died on 20 September 2011 from cancer, aged 63.",

He was a senior investigator for the New York City Department of Finance, a NYC Housing Authority Assistant, a detective-investigator for the Queens County District Attorney's Office, and Marshal for the City (mayoral appointment). In 1980, Sica's career changed when he became a minister of various Seventh-day Adventist Churches in the city. Prior to running for borough president, Sica ran for the State Assembly's 24th district in 2000, and lost to Mark Weprin (72% to 28%). Sica then went on to run for Council District 23 in 2001 and lost to David Weprin (Mark's brother) 69% to 31%. During his run for the Council District, Sica outlined his wishes to promote a reduction in crime, the lowering of taxes, and reform of the city's education system through increased investment by the state. In the race for the State Assembly, Sica received the support of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party, and the Right to Life. In his 2001 bid for the City Council, he was additionally endorsed by the Independence Party. Sica was unopposed for the Republican and Conservative parties' nomination in the race for Queens Borough President. Additionally, Borough President Helen Marshall ran unopposed for the nomination of the Democratic and Working Families parties. After counting the absentee ballots and affidavit ballots cast either for Marshall or Sica, the result turned out to be seventy-five percent for Marshall and twenty-five percent for Sica. Sica's strongest assembly district was A.D. 23 (comprising Howard Beach, Ozone Park, and Far Rockaway) where he garnered 39% of the votes cast. Sica is married to Naomi (Jungling) Sica, Ed.D. Sica has four adult children and four grandchildren. Sica is active in the American Legion, having served in the Army's Military Police. On September 18, 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to continue representing the Republicans of the 24th Assembly District in the New York Republican State Committee. In October 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and is again serving as its Chaplain.",

In 1994 Phil Koperberg was also the overall emergency controller, as firefighters battled to control over 800 New South Wales fires covering in excess of 800,000 hectares. In 1999, his expertise was again called upon during the severe hail storms which damaged more than 30,000 properties.\" In September 1997, Koperberg was appointed the RFS Commissioner when the Service was formed under the Rural Fires Act. Before this he had been Director-General of the New South Wales Bush Fire Service from May 1990. In March 2007 he was elected to State parliament and appointed to the Ministry. However, in December he was forced to stand aside due to a police investigation regarding domestic violence allegations from 1987. The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions declined to press charges and Koperberg was reinstated to the Ministry. He resigned from the Ministry on 22 February 2008. Koperberg did not recontest the 2011 state election.",

She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1991 and served until 2003, including work as cabinet posts in the area of Aboriginal Affairs and Provincial Secretary (February 2001 – October 2001), Post Secondary Education and Skills Training (Sept. 2001 – March 2002) and the Environment (March 2002 – June 2002). She was briefly out of cabinet following an incident involving one of her aides, to whom an investigation determined Lorje had given an \"affectionate slap\". She retired from the legislature and briefly moved to San Francisco with her husband, playwright and theatre director Tom Bentley. She later returned to Saskatoon and was reelected to Saskatoon City Council in the 2006 municipal election.",

He was a long-time Member of Parliament (MP), representing Ebbw Vale in South Wales for 31 years. He was one of the chief spokesmen for the Labour Party's left wing, and of left-wing British thought generally. His most famous accomplishment came when, as Minister of Health, he spearheaded the establishment of the National Health Service, which was to provide medical care free at point-of-need to all Britons. He resigned when the Attlee government decided to transfer funds from the National Insurance Fund to pay for rearmament. He subsequently became the leader of the left-wing group within the party, which came to be known as \"Bevanite\". Bevan remains one of Wales's most revered politicians. In 2004, over 40 years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the welfare state.",

  "text" : "Alfred Deakin (3 August 1856 – 7 October 1919) was a leader of the movement for Australian federation and later the second Prime Minister of Australia. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including pro-worker industrial reforms. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia. It is likely that he could have been Premier of Victoria, but he chose to devote his energy to federation. Throughout the 1890s Deakin was a participant in conferences of representatives of the Australian colonies that were established to draft a constitution for the proposed federation. He played an important role in ensuring that the draft was liberal and democratic and in achieving compromises to enable its eventual success. Between conferences, he worked to popularise the concept of federation and campaigned for its acceptance in colonial referenda. He then fought hard to ensure acceptance of the proposed constitution by the Government of the United Kingdom. As Prime Minister, Deakin completed a significant legislative program that makes him, with Labor's Andrew Fisher, the founder of an effective Commonwealth government. He expanded the High Court, provided major funding for the purchase of ships, leading to the establishment of the Royal Australian Navy as a significant force under the Fisher government, and established Australian control of Papua. Confronted by the rising Australian Labor Party in 1909, he merged his Protectionist Party with Joseph Cook's Anti-Socialist Party to create the Commonwealth Liberal Party (known commonly as the Fusion), the main ancestor of the modern Liberal Party of Australia. The Deakin-led Liberal Party government lost to Fisher Labor at the 1910 election, which saw the first time a federal political party had been elected with a majority in either house in Federal Parliament. Deakin resigned from Parliament prior to the 1913 election, with Joseph Cook winning the Liberal Party leadership ballot.",

In 1904, he defeated liberal publisher William Randolph Hearst for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. In the general election, Parker opposed popular incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt. After a disorganized and ineffective campaign, Parker was defeated by 336 electoral votes to 140, carrying only the traditionally Democratic Solid South. He then returned to practicing law. He managed John A. Dix's successful 1910 campaign for Governor of New York and served as prosecution counsel for the 1913 impeachment of Dix's successor, Governor William Sulzer.",

He was the author of several books of military history, including his controversial work The Donkeys (1961), which is considered to have inspired the musical satire Oh, What a Lovely War! Clark became known for his flamboyance, wit and irreverence. Norman Lamont called him \"the most politically incorrect, outspoken, iconoclastic and reckless politician of our times\". He is particularly remembered for his three-volume diary, a candid account of political life under Thatcher and a moving description of the weeks preceding his death, when he continued to write until he could no longer focus on the page. Clark was a passionate supporter of animal rights, joining activists in demonstrations at Dover against live export, and outside the House of Commons in support of Animal Liberation Front hunger-striker Barry Horne. When he died after radiation therapy for a brain tumour, his family said Clark wanted it to be stated that he had \"gone to join Tom and the other dogs.\"",

His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands. On May 25, 1870 he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court.",

  "text" : "Alexandros Koryzis (Greek: Αλέξανδρος Κορυζής, 1885 – April 18, 1941) was the Prime Minister of Greece briefly in 1941. He assumed this role on January 29, 1941, when his predecessor, the dictator Ioannis Metaxas died, during the Greco-Italian War. Prior to this, he was governor of the Bank of Greece. Although largely powerless, as the government was effectively controlled by King George II, he still bore the burden of the German invasion which commenced on April 6 of the same year. Less than two weeks later, on April 18, as German troops marched towards Athens and the city was placed under martial law, he committed suicide by shooting himself. The cause of his death was initially reported to be a heart attack, probably to avoid causing mass panic in Athens. He was originally from the small island of Poros in Greece, where a museum dedicated to his life and contribution exists today.",

In the three years before he was elected mayor, Sherman served as chief of Chicago's fire department. In 1844, Sherman ran for mayor of Chicago after an initial election was election invalidated based on charges of \"illegal proceedings and fraud.\". He ran as an Independent Democratic nominee against incumbent Democrat Augustus Garrett and Liberty Party nominee Henry Smith, winning the office with just over 50% of the vote. As mayor, he oversaw the city's purchase of its first piece of fire-fighting equipment and appointed Denis Swenie as fire chief. In 1850, he became one of the original trustees of Northwestern University. He moved to Waukegan, Illinois in 1856. In the 1870s, when a canal being dug in Lemont, Illinois revealed Athens marble, Sherman was instrumental in developing the marble quarry there.

He had a small auction house near the Chicago River and by the following year had formed a partnership with the Brown Brothers, which allowed him to become a leading land speculator and auctioneer. By October 1836, he had sales of more than $1.8 million. Elected mayor in 1843, he won re-election in 1844 only to have the election invalidated based on charges of \"illegal proceedings and fraud.\" Garrett ran in a second election that year, losing to Alson Sherman. During his terms in office, Garrett pushed to have the first brick school in Chicago, Dearborn School, turned into either a warehouse or an insane asylum, believing that the building was too large for use as a school.

As the Populist Party nominee, Bryan had another running mate as well, Thomas E. Watson. Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896. Arthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900. Sewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.",

He was the first Dominican-American elected to public office in the United States, and the first African American to win the Buffalo Mayoral Democratic Primary but was defeated in the following mayoral election. Eve was elected a New York State Assemblyman in 1966 and by the time of his retirement in 2002 had served in the New York State Assembly (143rd District 1967–82, 141st District 1983–2002) longer than any other incumbent member. As Deputy Speaker, he was the highest ranking African American in the New York State Legislature. During his political career he became a political foe of Western New York politician James D. Griffin and of New York State Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. He was a founding member of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. At the national level, Eve was once one of three alternates to the 15-person 1984 Democratic Party Platform Committee. Eve was an observer and negotiator during the 1971 Attica Prison riot and the first official to enter the facility to hear the demands of the inmates. An advocate for liberal causes such as economic development, education, job training and development, social services, crime prevention and parole reform, day care and housing, Eve was also a leader in the movement to legislate Harriet Tubman Day as a New York State holiday. He is the father of attorney and former candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York Leecia Eve.",

After working for the World Bank and in the private sector, he purchased a farm where he established a commercial vineyard and co-founded the Virginia Wineries Association. In 2002, Governor Mark Warner named Weed 5th District Trustee for the Virginia Land Conservation Trust Fund. In 2006, Weed faced competition for the Democratic Party nomination. Former Roanoke City Manager Bern Ewert argued that Weed had been beaten \"like a drum\" in 2004 and would probably lose again. Nevertheless, on May 20, 2006, Weed was chosen as the Democratic nominee by a 114-73 vote of the delegates to the party convention. In Weed's 2006 campaign, he emphasized the need for better treatment of military veterans. One of his campaign proposals was to establish a college for disabled veterans in the district. In both his campaigns, he advocated withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.",

Thompson previously served for six years as the Masten District councilman in the Buffalo Common Council. Thompson has been a lifelong Buffalonian and held political and politically related professional positions in Buffalo before his service in elective politics. Thompson was appointed to the city council in 2001 and was twice re-elected. He was discouraged from pursuing his interest in election to the United States House of Representatives in 2005. He was encouraged to pursue a New York Senate Seat, but was not nominated by the Democratic Party when the seat first became available in a special election. However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican.",

He did his secondary schooling at the Royal College of Curepipe. Called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1978, Ajay Daby studied in the United Kingdom and is a member of The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, London. He is married to Geeta Prayag, a laureate of the Queen Elizabeth College and doctor from the Sheffield University. Daby started his legal career as a private legal practitioner before joining the State Law Office as State Prosecutor, but only for a very brief period. He soon resigned from his post in the Judiciary to join politics. Elected MP of the PSM in 1982 in Flacq-Bon Acceuil, Constituency No 9 at the age of 26, he became the youngest MP in the country. He was further elected as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Mauritius. In 1983, he was one of the founder members of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). He was in the same year, re-elected MP of Flacq-Bon Acceuil under the banner of the newly created MSM and went on to become the youngest Speaker of the Commonwealth and Association des Parlementaires de Langue Francaise (AIPLF). He was re-elected in Constituency No 11 (Rose-Belle/Vieux Grand Port) and was called upon to take the post of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly yet again. In 1990, on a question of principle, Mr Daby refused to give the casting vote much needed by the then government to change the status of Mauritius to that of a republic and sever ties with the British Crown. He voiced his dissent with his leader and party on this question. The MSM - MMM newly formed coalition not having the required three-quarters majority to expel Mr Daby from his Speakership, went ahead to amend the Constitution to enable the removal of the Speaker by a simple majority. On 5 December 1990, the Constitution of Mauritius was amended accordingly. Mr Daby then joined the Mauritius Labour Party, but for a brief spell only. In 2001, Mr Daby was made Commissionner for Drug Assets Forfeiture under the Government led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth ,and later by Paul Berenger, until 2005, when there was a change of Government following general elections . Daby is back at the Bar and is regularly seen in high profile cases.",

The ticket campaigned for young voters especially. At the head of the ticket were two different candidates, Roger Calero and James Harris; Harris was an alternate in some states because Calero was Constitutionally ineligible because he is a lawful permanent resident of the United States (holding a green card), and not a US Citizen. They were the first pair to qualify for the ballot in Louisiana Calero/Kennedy won 5,127 votes and Harris/Kennedy 2,424. Originally from Indianapolis, Kennedy joined the socialist movement in 1973 in Louisville, Kentucky. She has worked in coal mines in Alabama, Colorado, Utah, and West Virginia. In 1977 she ran as the SWP candidate for mayor of Cleveland, Ohio against incumbent Republican Ralph Perk, garnering 1,225 votes and losing by a wide margin to Dennis Kucinich. She first joined the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1981, and was one of the leaders of a strike in Utah 2004, also being involved in litigation. In 2000, she ran for United States Senate as a certified write-in candidate in a race prompted by the death of candidate and former Governor of Missouri Mel Carnahan. Kennedy is currently employed as a garment worker. On February 12, 2016, Kennedy was announced as the nominee for president on the Socialist Workers Party ticket alongside Osborne Hart. Kennedy is the second woman to be the presidential nominee of the SWP and the first since Linda Jenness. She is on the ballot in seven states: Utah, Louisiana, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Washington and New Jersey.",
