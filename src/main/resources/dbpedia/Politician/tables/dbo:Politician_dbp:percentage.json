  "text" : "Jonathan Jennings (March 27, 1784 – July 26, 1834) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine-term congressman from Indiana. Born in either Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806. Jennings initially intended to practice law, but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself, and pursued interests in land speculation and politics. Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career. In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown, in Clark County. He was elected as the Indiana Territory's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate. By 1812 he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government. Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812. As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816, which authorized the organization of Indiana's state government and state constitution. He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention, held in Corydon in June 1816, where he helped draft the state's first constitution. Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government. In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements. Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life. His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years. Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings's life and impact on the development of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings's importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen's assessment that the state \"owes him more than she can compute.\"",

His positions created a rift between him and the Indiana General Assembly who overrode all of his anti-banking vetoes. He responded by launching legal challenges to the acts, but was ruled against by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia.",

  "text" : "Jack C. Voight (born December 17, 1945) is a Wisconsin insurance agent and a former State Treasurer of Wisconsin. He is a member of the Republican Party. Born and raised in New London, Wisconsin, Voight received his Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh in 1971. After serving as an Army sergeant from 1968–70, he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where he established an insurance agency. Voight served on the Appleton City Council from 1983–1993, holding the position of council president from 1992 - 1993. When incumbent Treasurer Cathy Zeuske ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1994, Voight ran as the Republican nominee to replace her. He was elected that year, and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. He was defeated for re-election on November 7, 2006, by Democrat Dawn Marie Sass, a former parole officer and AFSCME union activist, now working as a clerk at the department store Boston Store, in what was considered an upset. Voight had defeated Sass in both 1998 and 2002, and Sass said she spent less than $4000 on the race, most out of her own pocket. Voight held the position of president of the National Association of State Treasurers in 1997. In May 2009, Voight announced his interest in seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in 2010, but instead, the following June Voight announced he was going to run to replace retiring Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer. On April 5, 2011, he was defeated by former Assemblyman and unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor Tom Nelson, by roughly 52% - 48%. Voight blamed the political unrest stemming from Governor Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents.\"",

In February 1910 Asquith was considering him as a possible Chief Whip but was dissuaded by the outgoing Chief Whip Jack Pease who felt he was out of sympathy with many leading Liberals over the Lords. In March 1910 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office, a position he held until he was defeated in the December general election of the same year. He sought a return to parliament at the Salford North by-election, 1917 as a Coalition Liberal candidate but was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union. He became a supporter of the official Liberal party that opposed the Coalition Government. He sought to make a return to parliament standing as Liberal candidate for South Aberdeen, in 1922 without success. He tried again in 1923 without success. He had published two works on Liberal politicians; Mr Lloyd George, a Study (1930) and Herbert Gladstone, a Memoir (1932). His book on Lloyd George was entirely devoted to the shortcomings of the Liberal Leader.",

He won the seat with a majority of 8% of the votes over his Labour Party opponent.

Masterman polled nearly twice as many votes as Broad. With the Liberal vote split, the Labour candidate was able to take the seat. At the 1923 general election, with the two factions of the Liberal Party reunited, Broad stood in the Leyton East, but came third with only 28% of the votes. He did not stand for Parliament again.",

Samuel was the elder brother of Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel. He attended the Liverpool Institute and University College School, Hampstead, London. He served as Justice of the Peace for the county of London. In 1889 he stood as a candidate for the newly formed London County Council for the Progressive Party, the municipal wing of the Liberal Party. He contested Whitechapel, and was elected with 1,523 votes, along with his running mate, Charles Tarling, who polled 1,477 votes. He served for one term, before standing down in 1892. Samuel was selected as Liberal candidate for Whitechapel in 1900, in succession to his uncle Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, who had been the MP. He knew the constituency well, having represented it on the LCC. He held the seat for the Liberals with an increased majority. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 election with a landslide, he was again returned at Whitechapel. The Liberal Party faced the elections in 1910 against a resurgent Conservative Party. Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections. Over the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat. In 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery. In April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election. His Conservative opponent from 1910 ran against him in the by-election. He was re-elected with a reduced majority. Samuel retired from politics in 1916.",

He was the founder of Hanly's Flying Squadron, which advocated prohibition nationally and played an important role in raising awareness about the effect of alcohol and arousing public support for prohibition. During his term as governor he successfully advocated the passage of a local-option liquor law, which led the majority of Indiana's counties to ban liquor sales. His other achievements included banning gambling, fighting political corruption, and adjusting state agencies to operate on a non-partisan basis. He left office and the Republican Party and became an active and vocal prohibitionist. He was an unsuccessful Prohibition Party candidate for President of the United States in the 1916 election.",

He became the Chairman of the Industrial Co-Partnership Association. In 1943 he was granted the freedom of the borough of High Wycombe, of which he had been honorary recorder since 1905.

Boulton did not stand again until the 1923 general election, when he fought the Conservative-held New Forest and Christchurch division of Hampshire. The seat had not been contested in either 1918 or 1922, and in a straight contest with the sitting Conservative MP, Boulton won 46% of the votes. Boulton stood again at the 1924 general election, when a Labour candidate also contested the seat. The Conservative vote increased, and Boulton's second-placed vote was less than half the Tory total. He did not stand for Parliament again.",
