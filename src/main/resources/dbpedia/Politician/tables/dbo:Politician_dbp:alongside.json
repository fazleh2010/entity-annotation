Juli 1952 in Nakaminato (heute: Hitachinaka), Präfektur Ibaraki) ist ein japanischer Politiker, Parteivorsitzender der Kōmeitō und Abgeordneter des Sangiin für die Präfektur Tokio. Yamaguchi studierte Rechtswissenschaft an der Universität Tokio und wurde nach dem Bestehen der Anwaltsprüfung 1979 und Abschluss des Referendariats 1982 Mitglied der Anwaltskammer Tokio. Ab 1988 war er im Nihon Bengoshi Rengōkai, dem japanischen Verband der Anwaltskammern, tätig. Den Wechsel in die Politik vollzog Yamaguchi bei der Shūgiin-Wahl 1990, als er für die Kōmeitō im alten fünfmandatigen 10. Wahlkreis der Präfektur Tokio kandidierte und mit dem dritthöchsten Stimmenanteil gewählt wurde. 1993 wurde er souverän im Amt bestätigt. Wie die Mehrheit der Kōmeitō-Mitglieder schloss er sich nach dem Scheitern der Anti-LDP-Koalition 1994 der Neuen Fortschrittspartei (NFP) an. Als Kandidat der NFP verlor er aber 1996 den neuen Einzelwahlkreis Tokio 17 an Katsuei Hirasawa (LDP) und scheiterte auch im zweiten Anlauf, nun wieder für die („neue“) Kōmeitō, bei der Shūgiin-Wahl 2000. Yamaguchi versuchte daraufhin bei der Sangiin-Wahl 2001 einen der vier Sitze der Präfektur Tokio für die Kōmeitō zurückzugewinnen; in der zur Wahl stehenden Hälfte war die Kōmeitō seit 1995, als die Partei Teil der NFP war, nicht repräsentiert. Er erhielt über 800 Tausend Stimmen und zog mit dem zweithöchsten Stimmenanteil ins Sangiin ein. 2007 und 2013 wurde er jeweils für weitere sechs Jahre wiedergewählt. 2008 stieg Yamaguchi in die Kōmeitō-Führungsspitze auf, als er den Vorsitz des politischen Forschungsrates übernahm. Als der Parteivorsitzende Akihiro Ōta nach der Kōmeitō-Niederlage bei der Shūgiin-Wahl 2009 zurücktrat, übernahm Yamaguchis Ōtas Nachfolge. Er will die Kōmeitō, die nach fast einem Jahrzehnt Koalition mit der LDP erstmals wieder in der Opposition ist, auf einen eigenständigen Kurs führen, auch wenn sie bei einzelnen Wahlen weiterhin mit der LDP kooperiert, und schließt eine Koalition mit der nun regierenden Demokratischen Partei trotz einiger gemeinsamer Anliegen wie dem Präfektur- und Kommunalwahlrecht für Ausländer aus.",

He was born near Elizabeth City, North Carolina and was tutored at home until his attendance at the University of North Carolina, where he studied law. He graduated and was admitted to the bar in 1847, practicing in his home city until serving in the North Carolina Senate in 1856 and 1858. Pool ran against Gov. John W. Ellis in the 1860 election as head of the \"Opposition Party,\" which consisted primarily of former Whigs, like himself. With the war weariness increasing in civilian parts of the Confederacy during 1863, pro-Union activities began to become organized as resistance. The Loyal Order of the Heroes of America, also known as the \"Red Strings\", were started by several men from North Carolina, including Henderson Adams, North Carolina's State Auditor during this time. The actual leader was John Pool, who spent some time in a jail in Richmond, and who traveled through western Virginia in 1864. He was elected by the legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate as a Republican once North Carolina was readmitted in 1868. After his single term, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. until his death in 1884. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.",

Once settled in Indiana he became a ferryboat operator, a judge and a member of the state's first constitutional convention, in 1816, as a delegate from Franklin County. He was elected to the first session of the Indiana State House of Representatives in 1816. He was elected as a Crawford faction Democratic Republican (later an anti-Jacksonian Democrat) to the United States Senate in 1816. He was reelected to two more terms and served from December 11, 1816, until his death in 1831. While in the Senate he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Pensions for the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 20th Congresses, and chairman of the U.S. Committee on the Militia for the 16th and 17th Congresses. He died in Washington, D.C. and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery.",

His positions created a rift between him and the Indiana General Assembly who overrode all of his anti-banking vetoes. He responded by launching legal challenges to the acts, but was ruled against by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia.",

He served in the Virginia State Senate, and represented Virginia in the United States Senate when the state was readmitted after the American Civil War. He was United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a Democrat. Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the Freedmen's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate. Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He was caught in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.",

  "text" : "John Shields Tipton (* 14. August 1786 bei Sevierville, Tennessee; † 5. April 1839 in Logansport, Indiana) war ein US-amerikanischer Armeeoffizier und Politiker (Demokratische Partei). Er vertrat den Bundesstaat Indiana im US-Senat. Der im heutigen Sevier County geborene Tipton verlor schon früh seinen Vater, der von Indianern getötet wurde. Sein Großonkel, der ebenfalls John Tipton hieß, gehörte zu den prominenten Persönlichkeiten des Gebietes, weshalb er zeitweise zum Ziel von Aktionen der Anhänger eines von Tennessee unabhängigen State of Franklin wurde. Als er 17 Jahre alt war, zog John Tipton ins Harrison County im Indiana-Territorium. Dort heiratete er 1806 Martha Shields; die Ehe wurde 1816 geschieden. Er wurde in seiner neuen Heimat als Farmer tätig und trat einer Miliz bei, die ihn und andere Siedler vor Indianerangriffen schützen sollte. Während der Schlacht bei Tippecanoe kommandierte er die Kompanie der Yellow Jackets; später standen die Indiana Rangers im Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg unter seinem Befehl. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt bekleidete Tipton den Rang eines Majors. Nach dem Friedensschluss wurde er zum Brigadegeneral befördert. In der Folge schlug Tipton eine politische Laufbahn ein. Er war von 1819 bis 1823 Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana; während dieser Zeit gründete er die heutige Stadt Columbus, die ursprünglich den Namen Tiptonia trug. Er gehörte Kommissionen an, in denen über die neue Staatshauptstadt diskutiert wurde, und beteiligte sich an der Beilegung von Grenzstreitigkeiten zwischen Indiana und Illinois. 1823 wurde er United States Indian Agent und führte in dieser Funktion offizielle Verhandlungen mit den Stämmen der Potawatomi und der Miami. Als die Gespräche mit den Potawatomi nicht erfolgreich verliefen, leitete Tipton deren gewaltsame Umsiedlung ins heutige Kansas ein; die Aktion, die mehr als 40 Indianer das Leben kostete, wurde unter dem Namen Potawatomi Trail of Death bekannt. Tipton, der 1825 ein zweites Mal geheiratet hatte, wurde im Jahr 1831 von der Indiana General Assembly zum Nachfolger des verstorbenen US-Senators James Noble gewählt; zwischenzeitlich hatte Robert Hanna dessen Mandat kommissarisch wahrgenommen. Am 9. Dezember 1831 zog Tipton in den Senat ein, wo er nach einer Wiederwahl im folgenden Jahr bis zum 3. März 1839 verblieb. Während dieser Zeit war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Roads and Canals sowie des Committee on Indian Affairs. Aus gesundheitlichen Gründen verzichtete er auf eine erneute Kandidatur; zwei Wochen nach seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Senat verstarb er in Logansport, einer von ihm mitbegründeten Stadt. Das Tipton County in Indiana und dessen Verwaltungssitz Tipton sind nach John Tipton benannt.",

Im Jahr 1826 zog Joseph McDonald mit seiner Mutter aus Ohio ins Montgomery County in Indiana. Mit zwölf Jahren ging er dann bei einem Sattler in Lafayette in die Lehre. Später besuchte er das Wabash College in Crawfordsville, ehe er 1840 seinen Abschluss an der Asbury University in Greencastle machte. Er studierte danach die Rechtswissenschaften, wurde 1843 in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen und arbeitete von 1843 bis 1847 als Staatsanwalt, ehe er sich als selbständiger Jurist in Crawfordsville niederließ. Seine politische Laufbahn begann mit der Wahl ins Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten, dem er ab dem 4. März 1849 als Vertreter des achten Kongresswahlbezirks von Indiana angehörte. Nach zwei Jahren schied er zunächst wieder aus dem Kongress aus. 1856 wurde er zum Attorney General von Indiana gewählt, was er nach einer Bestätigung im Amt bis 1860 blieb. Nachdem er 1859 nach Indianapolis gezogen war, bewarb McDonald sich im Jahr 1864 vergeblich um das Amt des Gouverneurs von Indiana; er unterlag dem republikanischen Amtsinhaber Oliver Hazard Perry Morton, mit dem er seit langem befreundet war, deutlich. 1874 kandidierte Joseph McDonald dann erfolgreich für einen Sitz im Senat der Vereinigten Staaten, den er vom 4. März 1875 bis zum 3. März 1881 innehatte. Beim Versuch der Wiederwahl scheiterte er am späteren US-Präsidenten Benjamin Harrison.

  "text" : "John Douglas (6 mars 1828 - 23 juillet 1904) était un homme politique australien d'origine britannique et le septième premier ministre du Queensland. Douglas est né à Londres. Il était le septième fils d'Henry Alexander Douglas et d'Elizabeth Dalzell, son épouse. Ses parents sont morts en 1837 et il a fait ses études à Harrow et à l'Université de Durham, où il a également obtenu son baccalauréat en arts en 1850. On raconte qu'il a fait ses études à Rugby School mais son nom ne figure pas dans la liste de l'école de son époque. Il est arrivé en Nouvelle-Galles du Sud en 1851 et a été nommé commissaire des mines d'or, mais il démissionna pour devenir fermier. Il fut ensuite élu député de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud dans la circonscription de Darling Downs puis de Camden avant de démissionner le 17 juillet 1861. Il s'installa au Queensland en 1863 et fut élu député de Port Curtis. Le 1er mars 1866, il devint Postmaster General dans le premier gouvernement d'Arthur Macalister. Il fut nommé par la suite sénateur mais fut élu par la suite député de la nouvelle circonscription des Downs est. Il obtint le portefeuille de ministre des finances dans le second gouvernement Macalister en décembre 1866, puis en mai 1867, celui de ministre des travaux publics. Il redevint postmaster general dans le gouvernement de Charles Lilley de décembre 1868 jusqu'en novembre 1869, date à laquelle il démissionna pour devenir agent-général (ambassadeur) pour le Queensland à Londres. En 1871, il retourna au Queensland et devint député de Maryborough lors des élections de 1875. Il fut nommé ministre des terres publiques dans le gouvernement de George Thorn de juin 1876 jusqu'en mars 1877, lorsqu'il devint premier ministre. Son parti fut battu lors des élections de janvier 1879 et Douglas abandonna la politique. Il fut pendant un certain temps dans la direction du Brisbane Courier, et en 1885 le gouvernement le nomma magistrat résident de l'île Thursday. Après le décès de Sir Peter Scratchley en décembre 1885, il devint commissaire spécial pour le protectorat britannique de Nouvelle-Guinée pendant presque trois ans, et montra ses capacités de tact dans ses rapports avec les populations locales. En 1889, il revint à son ancien poste sur l'île Thursday. Il se rendit en Angleterre en 1902 et à son retour, continua son œuvre jusqu'à sa mort dans l'île. Douglas a été marié deux fois, d'abord à Marie, la fille de J. Simpson, en 1861 puis, en 1877, à Sarah, la fille de Michael Hickey. Il eut quatre fils de son deuxième mariage, dont deux ont eu une carrière distinguée. Le plus jeune, Robert Johnstone Douglas, (1883-1972), a été nommé juge de la cour suprême du Queensland en 1923 et l'aîné, Edward Archibald Douglas, (1877-1947), a été nommé à un poste similaire, en mars 1929. Alex Douglas, le nouveau député de Gaven est son arrière-petit-fils.",

  "text" : "John Bathgate (10 August 1809 – 21 September 1886) was a 19th-century New Zealand politician, and Minister of Justice and Commissioner of Stamps from 1872 to 1874. He was chosen by English backers as manager for the new Bank of Otago and emigrated to New Zealand within months. There was a great depression during the mid-1860s and Bathgate had lost money to the Commercial Banking Co., and had allowed the Southland Provincial Council to overdraw well beyond the agreed limit. These events put an end to Bathgate's banking career. From June 1871 to November 1872, he served on the Executive Council of the Otago Province. He represented two Dunedin electorates in the House of Representatives, first the City of Dunedin electorate from 1871 to 1874, when he resigned to take up the offer by Premier Julius Vogel of resident magistrate in Dunedin and district judge for Otago, and the Roslyn electorate from 1881 to 1884, when he was defeated. He was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 15 May 1885 to 21 September 1886, when he died. He was buried at Dunedin Northern Cemetery. He was the father of Alexander Bathgate. John Denniston was his son-in-law.",

  "text" : "John Parkin Taylor (1812 – 12 August 1875) was a 19th-century New Zealand runholder, and a politician in Otago and Southland. In his early life, Taylor lived in various countries and studied languages in Germany. He worked as a merchant and got married when he returned to England. Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

  "text" : "Eugene Joseph \"Gene\" McCarthy (March 29, 1916 – December 10, 2005) was an American politician, poet, and a long-time Congressman from Minnesota. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and the U.S. Senate from 1959 to 1971. In the 1968 presidential election, McCarthy was the first candidate to challenge incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States, running on an anti-Vietnam War platform. The unexpected vote total he achieved in the New Hampshire primary and his strong polling in the upcoming Wisconsin primary contributed to Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race, and lured Robert F. Kennedy into the contest. Fellow Minnesotan US Vice-President Hubert Humphrey also entered the race after Johnson's withdrawal. McCarthy would unsuccessfully seek the presidency five times altogether.",

  "text" : "Edward Allen Hannegan (* 25. Juni 1807 im Hamilton County, Ohio; † 25. Februar 1859 in St. Louis, Missouri) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker der Demokratischen Partei, der den Bundesstaat Indiana in beiden Kammern des Kongresses vertrat. Noch im Jahr von Edward Hannegans Geburt zogen seine Eltern mit ihm ins Bourbon County im Staat Kentucky. Dort besuchte er die öffentlichen Schulen, studierte die Rechtswissenschaften und arbeitete als Lehrer sowie als landwirtschaftliche Hilfskraft. 1827 wurde er dann in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen, woraufhin er nach Indiana umzog. Er lebte dort zunächst in Vincennes und Terre Haute, ehe er sich dauerhaft in Covington niederließ und dort als Jurist zu praktizieren begann. Politisch betätigte er sich in seiner neuen Heimat ebenfalls. Von 1832 bis 1833 saß er im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana, in das er später von 1841 bis 1842 noch einmal zurückkehrte. Zwischen dem 4. März 1833 und dem 3. März 1837 gehörte Hannegan dem Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten in Washington, D.C. an. Nachdem er in der Folge zunächst wieder als Jurist in Indiana gearbeitet hatte, zog er schließlich am 4. März 1843 in den US-Senat ein, wo er bis zum 3. März 1849 verblieb. Da ihn seine Partei nicht erneut nominierte, musste er nach einer Amtsperiode wieder aus dem Kongress ausscheiden. Während seiner Zeit im Senat war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Private Land Claims. Vom 30. Juni 1849 bis zum 13. Januar 1850 fungierte Edward Hannegan als Gesandter der Vereinigten Staaten in Preußen. Nach seiner Rückkehr war er wieder als Jurist in Covington tätig, bis er 1857 nach St. Louis umzog. Dort starb er zwei Jahre darauf an einer Überdosis Morphium.",

His father's family were publishers to the University of Edinburgh. After receiving a good education, McGlashan worked in the book trade. Inspired by his brother's work as secretary for the Otago Association, he decided to emigrate and left in 1848. He went to Adelaide in South Australia, then Melbourne and finally Sydney, where he sold the books that he took with him for a good profit. There, he purchased provisions that he took with himself to Dunedin in 1850, which he could once again sell at a good profit. In 1853, he was joined in Dunedin by his older brother, John McGlashan. Edward McGlashan worked at first as a registrar at the Supreme Court under Justice Sidney Stephen. He then leased a flour mill from William Henry Valpy on the Water of Leith. He also had a store and auction room in Princes Street. From 1858 until 1862, when the Otago Gold Rush began, he was in partnership with W. Carr Young, and they traded as Young and McGlashan. McGlashan visited England in 1862. Edward McGlashan stood for election in the first Otago Provincial Council, and represented the Dunedin Country electorate from 28 September 1853 to 15 September 1855. He was unsuccessful at some later provincial elections. In 1865, he contested the superintendancy, but was beaten by Thomas Dick. He would later represent the North Harbour electorate in the 6th and 7th council, from 17 March 1871 until the abolition of the provincial governments on 31 October 1876. He represented the City of Dunedin electorate from the 1860 general election to 1862 when he resigned; and then the Roslyn electorate from the 1871 general election to 1875, when he resigned. McGlashan had various business interests later in life. He dealt in stock and farmland, and owned Mount Stokes station. He owned steamers and was milling in The Catlins. He started to manufacture paper, but was unsuccessful in making it from tussock grasses. He moved to Timaru for some years and was a director of a number of companies, including a major shareholder in the New Zealand Shipping Company. After a long visit to England from 1881, he returned to Dunedin to live in St Clair. McGlashan married twice, and his second wife was Henrietta, the daughter of George Bell; they married on 10 March 1880. McGlashan's health was poor for his last few years. He died on 31 July 1889 at his residence in St Clair, and was survived by his second wife.",

Barff was born in the English county of Kent on 5 March 1833, probably at Lee (now part of Greater London), where he was baptised five months later. He first came to New Zealand to join the West Coast Gold Rush in the mid-1860s. The West Coast was initially part of the Canterbury Province and following a requisition in October 1865, he was first elected as the member of the West Coast Goldfields electorate in the following month. Barff and Evan Prosser, who was elected at the same time, were the first members from the West Coast on the Canterbury Provincial Council. In July 1866, Barff became a member for the Westland electorate. He remained a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council until December 1867. The Westland district separated from the Canterbury Province on 1 January 1868, and Barff joined the Westland County, which was the predecessor to Westland Province. During the existence of Westland County (January 1868 – November 1873), Barff represented the ridings of Westland, Ōkārito, and Arahura. He did not join the Westland Provincial Council, but stood for the first election in January 1874 as one of three candidates in the two-member Arahura electorate (incorrectly referred to as 'Waimea' in some sources). Much to his surprise, he was defeated with 120 votes by Richard Seddon and Houlahan, who were equal at 145 votes. He represented the Westland South electorate in the House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870, when he was defeated for Hokitika by John White. He then represented the Hokitika electorate from 1876 to 1879, when he was again defeated. Barff died in Kumara in 1882; he had never married.",

  "text" : "William Ezra Jenner (July 21, 1908 – March 9, 1985) was a U.S. Republican Indiana State and U.S. Senator. Jenner was born in Marengo, Crawford County, Indiana. He graduated with a law degree from Indiana University School of Law - Bloomington in 1930, and he set up practice in Paoli, Indiana. He was elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1934 and served as minority leader fun 1937 to 1939, and as majority leader and president pro tempore from 1939 to 1941. He ran for Governor of Indiana in 1940, finishing second at the Republican state convention. To serve in the military upon US entry to World War II, he resigned his seat in 1942. He returned from overseas action to run a US Senate seat vacancy caused by the death of Frederick Van Nuys and served from November 14, 1944, to January 3, 1945, becoming the first veteran of World War II elected to the Senate. He ran for the Senate in 1946 defeating Congressman Charles M. La Follette 1,994 to 105 at the Republocan state convention. He would go on the win the general election by over 150,000 votes. He ran for Governor of Indiana a second time in 1948, winning a plurality on the first ballot at the Republican state convention. Jenner lost the nomination on the second ballot to Holbart Creighton 885 to 931. Jenner was re-elected to the Senate in 1952. His friendship with fellow Indiana University classmate Harold W. Handley meant he was able to help Handley secure the Republican nomination for and election to the offices of Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Indiana. In Congress, he was a follower of Joseph McCarthy. He stated in 1954: Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by Congress, the President, or the people. Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system, another body representing another form of government – a bureaucratic elite. We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state.... The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization. It is a dynamic, aggressive, elite corps, forcing its way through every opening, to make a breach for a collectivist one-party state. It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government without suspecting that change is under way.... If I seem to be extremist, the reason is that this revolutionary clique cannot be understood, unless we accept the fact that they are extremist. It is difficult for people governed by reasonableness and morality to imagine the existence of a movement which ignores reasonableness and boasts of its determination to destroy; which ignores morality, and boasts of its cleverness in outwitting its opponents by abandoning all scruples. This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century.... This group ... is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable. In the Senate, Jenner opposed foreign aid and supported isolationist positions. Jenner alleged that the United Nations had infiltrated the American educational system in 1952. In 1958, he did not run for re-nomination. He resumed legal practice in Bedford, Indiana in 1959, where he died on March 9, 1985, at seventy six years of age.",

  "text" : "William Field Porter (1784–1869) was a ship owner from Liverpool, who migrated to South Australia in 1839. He relocated to Auckland in 1841, where he became a member of the New Zealand Parliament. Biography Porter was born in London in 1784. He married Alice Roper in Liverpool (c. 1811), with whom he had four children. Porter became a prominent sea captain, operating a small fleet out of his own yard at Liverpool. He and other members of the Porter family sailed for the British East India Company (e.g. his cousin, George Porter). In the late 1830s he suffered substantial losses at sea, which his son said were behind his decision to migrate. Porter sold his shipyard in Liverpool and took two of his ships, Porter, and Dorset, provisioned with livestock and a range of personnel (including a doctor, tutors and servants), so that he could set up a relatively self-sufficient farming station at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula. Porter himself captained his namesake, the Porter (a 252-ton brig), which he had built in 1824 and which had been strengthened so that it would be fit for the hazardous voyage. Upon arrival, he used this vessel to set up a shipping service from Port Lincoln and Adelaide to and from other Australian and New Zealand ports. Porter also built the Dorset (95 tons) in 1838, specifically as a back-up ship for the journey to Australia. This was sold upon arrival. Porter’s expedition arrived at Port Lincoln in early 1839. The party was just one of three to arrive with settlers for the district in the 1830s and 1840s. It became apparent to him that Adelaide would be the main settlement in South Australia and that immediate prospects for Port Lincoln would be limited. Impatient for success, he decided to forego the significant investment and effort he had made in the fledgling settlement (e.g. building two houses, establishing a bank and helping build the first Church of England). He abandoned the settlement in 1840. Although Porter’s tenure in Port Lincoln only lasted 18 months, he had, nevertheless, been appointed the first Magistrate of the Eyre Peninsular and his family left its name at ‘Porter Bay’. In May 1841, Porter arrived in New Zealand. Alice was sceptical and had returned to Liverpool with their son, William Field junior. She waited until he was properly settled, before joining him in Auckland. Porter served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Suburbs of Auckland electorate from 1853 to 1855, when he retired, but did not serve in any further Parliaments. He also served on the Auckland Provincial Council. Porter died on 30 March 1869 at Mangatangi, Waikato.",

  "text" : "Waller Taylor (* um 1779 im Lunenburg County, Virginia; †  26. August 1826 ebenda) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker. Er war einer der beiden ersten US-Senatoren für den Bundesstaat Indiana nach dessen Beitritt zur Union. Waller Taylors genaues Geburtsjahr ist nicht bekannt. Er verbrachte seine Kindheit in Virginia, wo er die öffentlichen Schulen besuchte, die Rechtswissenschaften studierte und in der Folge auch als Jurist praktizierte. Zwischen 1800 und 1802 hatte er als Mitglied des Abgeordnetenhauses von Virginia sein erstes politisches Mandat inne. Im Jahr 1804 zog Taylor nach Vincennes im Indiana-Territorium, wo er ebenfalls eine Kanzlei betrieb. 1807 wurde er zum Richter für Billigkeitsrecht (Chancellor) auf territorialer Ebene ernannt; im selben Jahr trat er der Miliz des Territoriums bei und stieg dort zum Major auf. Er beteiligte sich an Auseinandersetzungen mit Indianern und war von 1809 bis 1810 persönlicher Adjutant von William Henry Harrison während der Kämpfe gegen Tecumseh, wobei er an der Schlacht bei Tippecanoe teilnahm. Taylor blieb bis zum Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg beim Militär und wurde als Adjutant General oberster militärischer Befehlshaber der Streitkräfte des Indiana-Territoriums. Im politischen Bereich gehörte Taylor zu den Befürwortern der Sklaverei, die nach seiner Meinung in Indiana hätte zugelassen werden sollen. Die Pro-Sklaverei-Fraktion war jedoch im Territorium in der Minderheit, sodass im Jahr 1812 auch sein Versuch fehlschlug, als Delegierter ins Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten gewählt zu werden; das Mandat ging an den späteren Gouverneur Jonathan Jennings. Diesen hatte Taylor während des Wahlkampfes zu einem Duell herausgefordert, doch Jennings lehnte ab. Nach der Staatsgründung Indianas wurden Taylor, der den Democratic Republicans angehörte, und James Noble als die beiden ersten US-Senatoren nach Washington D.C. entsandt. Die Amtszeit beider Politiker begann am 11. Dezember 1816, wobei Taylor sich bereits 1818 zur Wiederwahl stellen musste. Er gewann diese und verblieb damit bis zum 3. März 1825 im Kongress. Während dieser Zeit spaltete sich die Demokratisch-Republikanische Partei in mehrere Faktionen auf; Taylor schloss sich dem Flügel um John Quincy Adams und Henry Clay an, aus dem später die National Republican Party entstand. Nach dem Ende seiner politischen Laufbahn kehrte Taylor nach Virginia zurück. Er starb bereits im folgenden Jahr und wurde in Lunenburg beigesetzt.",

  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Channing Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the 1884 election. Jessie Buckland was his son John's daughter.",

Charles Cathcart wurde auf Madeira geboren, wo sein Vater als Konsul der Vereinigten Staaten fungierte. Später lebte die Familie in Spanien, ehe 1819 die Rückkehr in die USA erfolgte. Cathcart fuhr danach zunächst zur See, ehe er 1830 nach Washington, D.C. zog und dort als Beamter für das General Land Office arbeitete. Schließlich ließ er sich 1833 in Indiana nieder. Er wurde Friedensrichter im LaPorte County und betätigte sich in der Landwirtschaft sowie als Landvermesser. 1837 übernahm Charles Cathcart sein erstes politisches Amt, als er in den Senat von Indiana gewählt wurde, in dem er bis 1840 verblieb. Einige Jahre später zog er für die Demokraten ins Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten ein; diesem gehörte er zwischen dem 4. März 1845 und dem 3. März 1849 an. Am 6. Dezember 1852 erfolgte dann die Ernennung zum US-Senator als Nachfolger des verstorbenen James Whitcomb. Bereits am 18. Januar 1853 schied er wieder aus dem Senat aus. Ein weiterer Versuch, ins Repräsentantenhaus gewählt zu werden, verlief 1860 erfolglos. Cathcart zog sich danach aus der Politik zurück und beschränkte sich auf seine landwirtschaftliche Tätigkeit. 1888 starb er auf seiner Farm in der Nähe von La Porte.",

  "text" : "Bunmei Ibuki (jap. 伊吹 文明, Ibuki Bunmei; * 9. Januar 1938 in Kyōto) ist ein japanischer Politiker, Präsident des Unterhauses ehemaliger Generalsekretär der Liberaldemokratischen Partei und mehrfacher Minister. Innerhalb der Partei führte er von 2005 bis 2012 die Ibuki-Faktion (offiziell: Shisuikai). Ibuki studierte bis 1960 Wirtschaftswissenschaften an der Universität Kyōto. Anschließend war er Beamter im Finanzministerium. 1983 wurde er erstmals im 1. Wahlkreis der Präfektur Kyōto ins Unterhaus gewählt und seither sieben Mal bestätigt. Von September 1997 bis Juli 1998 war er Arbeitsminister im Kabinett von Ryūtarō Hashimoto. Unter Premierminister Yoshirō Mori war er zwischen 2000 und 2001 Vorsitzender der Nationalen Kommission für öffentliche Sicherheit und Staatsminister für Katastrophenschutz. Von 2006 bis 2007 war Ibuki Bildungsminister im Kabinett von Shinzō Abe. Kurz nach seinem Amtsantritt hatte er sich dagegen ausgesprochen, Englisch als Fremdsprache verpflichtend in die Lehrpläne japanischer Grundschulen aufzunehmen: „Es gibt keinen Grund Englisch zu lernen, solange die Kinder nicht schönes Japanisch sprechen“. Nach Abes Rücktritt wurde er unter dem Parteivorsitzenden Yasuo Fukuda, den seine Faktion bei der Wahl gegen Tarō Asō unterstützt hatte, Generalsekretär der LDP. Bei der Kabinettsumbildung am 1. August 2008 ernannte Fukuda Ibuki zum Finanzminister, Nachfolger als Generalsekretär wurde Tarō Asō. Als dieser einen Monat später zum Parteivorsitzenden und Premierminister gewählt wurde, ersetzte er Ibuki durch Shōichi Nakagawa. Im neuen Kabinett war Ibukis Einfluss gewachsen: die Ibuki-Faktion war dort mit drei Ministern vertreten. Bei der für die LDP verheerenden Unterhauswahl 2009 verlor Ibuki seinen Wahlkreis an den Demokraten Tomoyuki Taira, wurde aber über den Verhältniswahlblock Kinki wiedergewählt. Bei der Unterhauswahl 2012 erhielt Ibuki weniger Stimmen als 2009, konnte seinen Wahlkreis mit weniger als einem Drittel der Stimmen aber in einem zersplitterten Kandidatenfeld zurückgewinnen. Anschließend wurde er zum Präsidenten des Unterhauses gewählt. Den Vorsitz der bisherigen Ibuki-Faktion übernahm Toshihiro Nikai. Ibuki ist, wie Premier Abe und weitere Kabinett- und LDP-Parteimitglieder, Mitglied der als revisionistisch geltenden Nippon Kaigi. Ibukis Ehefrau Yūko ist eine Enkelin von Takahashi Ryūtarō, dem Eigentümer des Baseball-Teams Takahashi Unions, Vorsitzenden des japanischen Fußballverbandes, Ryokufūkai-Oberhausabgeordneten und Ministers für Internationalen Handel und Industrie der Nachkriegszeit.",

He attended New Oxford Academy and Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. He graduated from Hampden–Sydney College in south central Virginia in 1815 and practiced law in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons (1821–1823 and 1826) and was a judge of the superior court of North Carolina (1827–1836). Strange was elected as a Jacksonian (later Democrat) to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Willie Person Mangum and served from December 5, 1836, to November 16, 1840, when he resigned and resumed the practice of law in Fayetteville, where he died on February 19, 1854 and was buried in the family burial ground at Myrtle Hill, near Fayetteville. Strange was an ardent and active Freemason, serving as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina, Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons from 1812 through 1814. He also served as Master of Phoenix Lodge No. 8, A. F. & A. M., in Fayetteville, NC, for the year 1826. Strange commanded the Fayetteville Independent Light Infantry (FILI), an independent militia company in Fayetteville, NC. In this role Strange served as the escort for the Marquis de Lafayette when he visited Fayetteville on the 5th of March, 1825. A number of people read law with him, including his nephew James Strange French. He was the author of Eoneguski, or the Cherokee Chief, which has been called the first North Carolina novel. The Robert Strange Country House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.",

Sein erstes politisches Mandat übernahm Hanna im Jahr 1816 als Delegierter zum Verfassungskonvent von Indiana. Nach dem Beitritt zur Union diente er als Brigadegeneral in der Miliz des neuen Staates. 1825 zog er nach Indianapolis. Nach dem Tod von US-Senator James Noble am 26.

Er nahm sein Mandat in Washington als Mitglied der National Republican Party vom 19. August 1831 bis zum 3. Januar 1832 wahr. Danach gehörte er noch von 1832 bis 1833 sowie von 1836 bis 1839 dem Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana an; zwischen 1842 und 1846 gehörte er dem Senat von Indiana an.

Von 1910 bis 1914 war er der Postmeister der Stadt; während des Ersten Weltkriegs stand er zwischen 1917 und 1918 dem Verteidigungsrat des Steuben County vor. 1919 zog Willis als Abgeordneter ins Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana ein, dem er bis 1921 angehörte. Seine nächste Kandidatur für ein politisches Amt erfolgte erst 1938, doch dabei verfehlte er noch die Wahl in den US-Senat. Zwei Jahre später bewarb er sich um den zweiten Senatssitz Indianas und besiegte den demokratischen Amtsinhaber Sherman Minton. Nach sechs Jahren trat er nicht zur Wiederwahl an, sodass er am 3. Januar 1947 aus dem Kongress ausschied. Willis stand danach der Steuben Printing Company als Präsident vor und gehörte dem Kuratorium des Tri-State College in Angola an.",

He spent three years in New Zealand as a runholder and during that time, he represented the Christchurch Country electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives for one term. Brittin was born in Huntingdonshire, England in 1823. He received an education as a solicitor, but during his time in New Zealand, he did not practice in that profession. Brittin came out to New Zealand on the Minerva in 1853, together with his wife, and his brother John Danns Brittin, his wife and son. The Minerva, one of the ships chartered by the Canterbury Association, had left London on 29 September and Plymouth on 12 October 1852, and arrived in Lyttelton on 2 February 1853. Other notable passengers on the ship were Henry Sewell, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Jane and John Deans, Thomas Rowley, John Cuff, and Elizabeth Torlesse. The Brittin brothers took up run 105 at the mouth of the Rakaia River. They sold their land in 1854, and took land in the Port Hills. In the 1855 election, Brittin was one of four candidates in the two-member Christchurch Country electorate. He came second and represented the electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament in 1856, but resigned during the 1856 session before the end of his term; the Speaker read out his letter of resignation on 31 July, two weeks before the session finished. He had to return to England on 'urgent business' in 1856 and feared that he may not be back in time for the start of the 1857 parliamentary session. In fact, he did not return to New Zealand, and historian George Macdonald noted that he \"was not heard of again\" in Canterbury. The resulting by-election was won by John Ollivier, who beat Crosbie Ward. Brittin died in 1881 and is buried at All Saints, the Parish Church of St Ives. His wife Anna Maria Brittin, who died in 1902, is buried next to him.",

Im Alter von 24 Jahren zog er 1852 in das Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana ein. Nach einer Legislaturperiode konzentrierte er sich wieder auf seine juristische Tätigkeit; so wurde er 1856 Richter am staatlichen Kreisgericht. 1858 folgte eine weitere Amtszeit im Parlament seines Staates. Im Januar 1863 wurde Turpie in den US-Senat gewählt. Er gewann bei einer Nachwahl das Mandat des aus dem Kongress ausgeschlossenen Jesse D. Bright, dem Illoyalität gegenüber der Union während des Sezessionskrieges vorgeworfen wurde. Allerdings war die Amtszeit bereits im März desselben Jahres wieder beendet. David Turpie wurde danach zunächst wieder juristisch tätig. 1872 zog er nach Indianapolis. Dort setzte er seine politische Laufbahn als Mitglied des staatlichen Repräsentantenhauses fort; von 1874 bis 1875 war er dessen Speaker. Zwischen 1886 und 1887 übte Turpie das Amt des Staatsanwalts für den Gerichtsdistrikt von Indiana aus. Schließlich erfolgte im Jahr 1887 seine zweite Wahl in den Senat in Washington. Er setzte sich gegen den späteren US-Präsidenten Benjamin Harrison durch und gehörte dem Kongress nach einer Wiederwahl bis 1899 an, ehe er dem Republikaner Albert J. Beveridge unterlag. Während seiner zwölf Jahre im Senat war Turpie unter anderem Vorsitzender des Volkszählungsausschusses. Von 1898 bis 1899 stand er der demokratischen Senatsfraktion als Chairman vor. Politisch setzte er sich unter anderem für eine Volksabstimmung zur Aufnahme Hawaiis in die Vereinigten Staaten ein.",

  "text" : "Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky's Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems. Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia's Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title \"the players' commissioner\". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951. Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor.",

He received his B.A. degree from Loyola College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1920. While in school, O'Conor was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun from 1919 to 1920. On November 24, 1920, O'Conor married Mary Eugenia Byrnes (1896–1971) and they had five children, Herbert R. Jr., Eugene F., James Patrick, Robert and Mary Patricia. From 1921 to 1922, O'Conor served as the assistant state's attorney for Baltimore. In 1923, he was elected State's Attorney of Baltimore City, and served there until he was elected as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1934. O'Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner SS Morro Castle in 1934. O'Conor identified her body which was found face under close to the wreck site. O'Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O'Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor's Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943. Near the end of World War II, O'Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system. O'Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, Hughes served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery.",

He served as the 14th Governor of Indiana during the American Civil War, and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln. During the war, Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly. He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval, and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans. He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers. As one of President Lincoln's \"war governors\", Morton made signification contributions to the war effort, more than any other man in the state, and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support. During his second term as governor, and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke, he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during his second term in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.",

He served in the United States Senate from 1869–1875 and again from 1879–1881. Recognized as an authority on constitutional law, he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th century America. Carpenter presented cases before the U. S. Supreme Court involving such matters as states' rights and regulation of corporations. Originally a Democrat, he evolved into a Republican during the Civil War, and helped perpetuate the Wisconsin party's political machinery. His sustained support for President Ulysses S. Grant's administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden in the disputed presidential election of 1876 outraged many Republicans. A gifted orator, he was dubbed \"the Webster of the West.\"",

From his Senate seat, he then ran a powerful political machine, using A. D. Watts \"to keep the machine oiled back home,\" in the words of one journalist. Senator Simmons refused to endorse Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928. This, together with the Great Depression, led to Simmons being defeated in the 1930 Democratic primary by Josiah W. Bailey, who was backed by Governor O. Max Gardner.",

Franklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election. In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906–1908). He played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London. During World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. His wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937). Franklin died of cancer on 29 October 1941 aged 68 and was buried at Lyndhurst, Hampshire.",

He served as Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon's U.S. Senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the Virginius, a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C. Gibbs United States District Attorney at Portland, Oregon. In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General under the controversy of his wife allegedly taking payment money from the custom house firm Pratt & Boyd in order to drop litigation by the U.S. Justice Department. After his resignation, Williams took part in counting Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes in settling the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland's mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams advocated women's suffrage and that marriage and divorce proceedings needed to be handled by the civil courts rather than the church. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted while Mayor of Portland for not enforcing gambling restriction statutes; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor. On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Williams was the second to last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration.",

The son of a coal miner, Bevan was a lifelong champion of social justice, rights of working people, and democratic socialism. He was a long-time Member of Parliament (MP), representing Ebbw Vale in South Wales for 31 years. He was one of the chief spokesmen for the Labour Party's left wing, and of left-wing British thought generally. His most famous accomplishment came when, as Minister of Health, he spearheaded the establishment of the National Health Service, which was to provide medical care free at point-of-need to all Britons. He resigned when the Attlee government decided to transfer funds from the National Insurance Fund to pay for rearmament. He subsequently became the leader of the left-wing group within the party, which came to be known as \"Bevanite\". Bevan remains one of Wales's most revered politicians. In 2004, over 40 years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the welfare state.",

  "text" : "Alick Dudley Kay (3 October 1884 – 4 February 1961) was an Australian politician and Domain orator. He is described by the Australian Dictionary of Biography as a \"harmless ratbag\". Kay was born in the Sydney suburb of Petersham, New South Wales and educated at Petersham and Stanmore public schools. He worked in a wholesale warehouse and in 1913 married Mary Elizabeth Clasby, a 52-year-old widow with five children (one of her sons, John Clasby, was briefly a federal MP). He was given a state funeral. Alick became a clerk with New South Wales Government Railways and joined the army in 1915. Kay ran unsuccessfully for the federal seat of South Sydney for the Nationalist Party in 1917. In 1918 he left the Nationalists and started appearing regularly as an anti-Communist speaker at Sydney Domain. He also travelled regularly to Melbourne to orate next to the Yarra. In 1925, he won one of the five seats of North Shore under proportional representation in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent. In parliament, he regularly voted with Labor to the horror of his former supporters. Under the electoral system, the Australian Labor Party automatically won his position if he resigned, so Jack Lang offered him a position on the Metropolitan Meat Board in 1926 as a consumers' representative. The Thomas Bavin government passed legislation in 1927 to remove him from the board. After Lang's return to power in 1930, he was reappointed to the board, but was sacked again by the Bertram Stevens government. In 1933, Kay travelled to England.
