An opponent of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's government, but an even stronger opponent of the East German Socialist Unity Party and communism in general, he was one of the founding fathers of post-war German democracy. He was also a noted opponent of the far-right and the far-left, i.e. the Nazi Party and the Communist Party of Germany, during the Weimar Republic, and is famous for his description of the communists as \"red-painted Nazis.\" He spent over ten years in Nazi concentration camps, where he was severely mistreated.",

  "text" : "Kazimierz Władysław Bartel (Polish pronunciation: [kaˈʑimjɛʂ vwaˈdɨswaf ˈbartɛl], English: Casimir Bartel; 3 March 1882 – 26 July 1941) was a Polish mathematician, scholar, diplomat and politician who served as Prime Minister of Poland three times between 1926 and 1930 and the Senator of Poland from 1937 until the outbreak of World War II. Bartel was appointed Minister of Railways between 1919 and 1920, in 1922–1930 he was a member of Poland's Sejm. After Józef Piłsudski's May Coup d'état in 1926, he became prime minister and held this post during three broken tenures: 1926, 1928–29, 1929–1930. Bartel was the Deputy Prime Minister between 1926–1928 and Minister of Religious Beliefs and Public Enlightenment, when Piłsudski himself assumed the premiership, however, Bartel was in fact \"de facto\" prime minister during this period as Piłsudski did not concern himself with the day-to-day functions of the cabinet and the government. In 1930 upon giving up politics, he returned to the university as professor of mathematics. In 1930 he became rector of the Lwów Polytechnic and was soon awarded an honorary doctorate and membership in the Polish Mathematical Association. In 1937 he was appointed the Senator of Poland and held this post until World War II. After the Invasion of Poland by the Soviets and subsequent occupation, he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical Institute. In 1940 he was summoned to Moscow and offered a seat in the Soviet parliament. Following Operation Barbarossa, on 30 June 1941 the German Wehrmacht entered Lwów and began the persecution of the local intelligentsia. Bartel was imprisoned by the Gestapo two days later and offered to create a Polish puppet government with himself as the head. His eventual refusal of accepting the terms imposed by the occupant was considered as an act of treason against the German authorities. By the order of Heinrich Himmler Bartel was murdered on 26 July 1941, shortly after the Massacre of Lwów professors had ended.",

On May 1, 2014, Kelly took over the remainder of Ford's duties when Ford entered drug rehabilitation and started a leave of absence from Toronto City Council. These powers were returned when Ford returned to his job on July 1. Even though Kelly had all the powers of the mayoral office for 3 months, Ford still technically held the title of Mayor, while Kelly was still referred to as the Deputy Mayor.",

  "text" : "Nicholas \"Nick\" Xenophon (born Xenophou; 29 January 1959) is an Australian senator for South Australia and the leader of the Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) political party in the Australian Senate. He was first elected to a six-year Senate term in the federal parliament as an independent at the 2007 federal election and was re-elected at the 2013 federal election, before forming the nascent NXT and electing a total of four representatives including one in the lower house at the 2016 federal election. Xenophon was first elected to South Australian parliament at the 1997 state election before an unprecedented result at the 2006 state election, which propelled him to federal parliament. Xenophon first contested a parliamentary seat and was unexpectedly successful at the 1997 state election. Despite an upper house primary vote of just 2.9 percent, his independent No Pokies ticket collected many preferences and reached the upper house electoral quota of 8.3 percent, making him the first successful upper house independent in several decades. Campaigning to retain his seat at the 2006 state election, he received unexpected and unprecedented levels of support, with an upper house primary vote of 20.5 percent, resulting in a total of three successful upper house candidates. A year later he stood down to contest the 2007 federal election and was elected to the Senate with an upper house primary vote of 14.8 percent. This increased to 24.9 percent at the 2013 election. The nascent NXT ran candidates in most states and territories including all South Australian seats at the 2016 federal election. As the election was a double dissolution the Senate electoral quota of 14.3 percent was halved to 7.7 percent. Though NXT's South Australian Senate primary vote was reduced to 21.7 percent, the halved Senate quota resulted in three successful NXT candidates in the upper house alone. NXT was also successful in the South Australian Division of Mayo in the lower house. While his original No Pokies platform centred on an anti-gambling policy, he has since become an advocate in many other policy areas. These include defence, education, health, infrastructure, regional affairs, national security, foreign policy, and civil liberties.",

Elected in November 1970, she first took office in January 1971, holding one of five seats (Position 1) in House District 13 (mostly in Lane County). With the implementation in 1972 of a reapportionment plan that replaced all existing Oregon House districts with new single-member districts, Fadeley represented new District 42 starting with the 1973 legislative session. In 1971 and 1973, she chaired the House Environment and Land Use Committee. During her tenure as the chair, the committee oversaw the passage of Senate Bill 100, Oregon’s pioneering, statewide land-use planning legislation, as well as the Oregon Bottle Bill. The passage of SB 100 prompted the formation of 1000 Friends of Oregon, a watchdog organization committed to the defense of, and advocacy for, the state's land-use program. Later she became a charter member and a national board member of the Older Women's League (OWL), a grassroots organization that advocates for women as they age. After her service in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Fadeley began a career at the University of Oregon, where she was assistant vice provost. Fadeley was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was married to Edward Fadeley for about 30 years, ending in 1984. During the 1970s, the couple both served in theOregon Legislature — Nancie in the House and Ed in the Senate. The mother of two children, Fadeley is now a freelance journalist who writes about Oregon history, environmental issues, and concerns of older women.",

As premier, he vigorously promoted economic development, championed the welfare state, and emphasized modernization of education and transportation. Smallwood abandoned his youthful socialism and collaborated with bankers, turning against the militant unions that sponsored numerous strikes. The results of his efforts to promote industrialization were mixed, with the most favourable results in hydroelectricity, iron mining and paper mills. Smallwood was charismatic and controversial. Never shy, he dubbed himself \"the last Father of Confederation.\" While many Canadians today remember Smallwood as the man who brought Newfoundland into the Canadian Confederation, the opinion held by Newfoundlanders and their diaspora remains sharply divided as to his legacy.",

  "text" : "John Hutchyns Tyndall' (14 July 1934 – 19 July 2005) was a British National Socialist. As a prominent figure in British nationalism during the second half of the twentieth century, Tyndall was involved during the 1960s with neo-Nazi movements, most notably being the deputy leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement under Colin Jordan. However, he is best known for leading the National Front (NF) in the late 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Born in Devon, Tyndall undertook national service prior to reading the work of Adolf Hitler and involving himself in extreme-right politics. In the mid-1950s he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Growing frustrated with the LEL's approach, in 1957 he co-founded the National Labour Party (NLP) with John Bean. In 1960 the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Tyndall grew close to Jordan and together they embraced an overt Neo-Nazi approach to racial nationalism, establishing a paramilitary group called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement. In 1962 he was convicted and imprisoned for establishing a paramilitary organisation. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall then formed his Greater Britain Movement, another explicitly Neo-Nazi group, in 1964. In 1967 Tyndall joined the newly established National Front, which was then led by Chesterton. He took on the role of Vice Chairman and eventually assumed the position of Chairman in 1972. His leadership was however threatened by both a 'populist moderate' faction and a Strasserite faction. In 1974 he was deposed as Chairman and briefly expelled from the party the following year. On his return he resumed his position as Chairman, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980, forming his short-lived New National Front. In 1982 he established the new British National Party, which grew into the most prominent extreme-right group in the UK by the late 1980s. Electoral success however largely eluded the party. Tyndall's refusal to moderate any of the party's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of 'modernisers', who succeeded in ousting him in 1999, when he was replaced by Nick Griffin. Tyndall retained his affiliation with the BNP for the following few years prior to his death.",

Ellis attended the University of North Carolina, studied law under Richmond Mumford Pearson, practiced law, and was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly from Rowan County. He served as a state superior court judge from 1848 to 1858. He was elected Governor in 1858 by a large majority over Duncan K. McRae, a Democrat supported by remnants of the Whig Party. Ellis was easily re-elected in 1860 over John Pool. As the American Civil War was beginning, President Abraham Lincoln requested troops from North Carolina to quell the rebellion. Ellis replied, “I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.” During the start of the U.S. Civil War Governor John Willis Ellis ordered cadets from the North Carolina Military Academy to Raleigh, North Carolina to serve as drill masters. Shortly after North Carolina seceded from the Union, Ellis died in office. The Speaker of the North Carolina Senate, Henry T. Clark, completed his term.

  "text" : "John Warfield Johnston (September 9, 1818 – February 27, 1889) was an American lawyer and politician from Abingdon, Virginia. He served in the Virginia State Senate, and represented Virginia in the United States Senate when the state was readmitted after the American Civil War. He was United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a Democrat. Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the Freedmen's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate. Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He was caught in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.",

Im Jahr 1826 zog Joseph McDonald mit seiner Mutter aus Ohio ins Montgomery County in Indiana. Mit zwölf Jahren ging er dann bei einem Sattler in Lafayette in die Lehre. Später besuchte er das Wabash College in Crawfordsville, ehe er 1840 seinen Abschluss an der Asbury University in Greencastle machte. Er studierte danach die Rechtswissenschaften, wurde 1843 in die Anwaltskammer aufgenommen und arbeitete von 1843 bis 1847 als Staatsanwalt, ehe er sich als selbständiger Jurist in Crawfordsville niederließ. Seine politische Laufbahn begann mit der Wahl ins Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten, dem er ab dem 4. März 1849 als Vertreter des achten Kongresswahlbezirks von Indiana angehörte. Nach zwei Jahren schied er zunächst wieder aus dem Kongress aus. 1856 wurde er zum Attorney General von Indiana gewählt, was er nach einer Bestätigung im Amt bis 1860 blieb. Nachdem er 1859 nach Indianapolis gezogen war, bewarb McDonald sich im Jahr 1864 vergeblich um das Amt des Gouverneurs von Indiana; er unterlag dem republikanischen Amtsinhaber Oliver Hazard Perry Morton, mit dem er seit langem befreundet war, deutlich. 1874 kandidierte Joseph McDonald dann erfolgreich für einen Sitz im Senat der Vereinigten Staaten, den er vom 4. März 1875 bis zum 3. März 1881 innehatte. Beim Versuch der Wiederwahl scheiterte er am späteren US-Präsidenten Benjamin Harrison. McDonald zog sich danach aus der Politik zurück und starb 1891 in Indianapolis.",

He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate. Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated, 57.3 to 38.9. Though considered as a frontrunner, in April 2015, he declined to run for the US Senate seat Marco Rubio is expected to vacate before the Senate elections, 2016 to run for the US Presidency. Atwater has since changed his mind, stating that he may run in the upcoming 2016 Senate election.",

  "text" : "John Samuel Potts (12 August 1861 – 28 April 1938) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served a Member of Parliament (MP) for twelve years between 1922 and 1938. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \"the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper. Potts was comfortably re-elected at the 1935 general election, but died in office in 1938, in Barnsley, aged 76. His illness and death have been connected with the shock he received when the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Pit Disaster occurred two years earlier. His home was in the lane which led to the colliery.",

In 2014, Duarte publicly compared Israel's alleged actions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to that of Nazi Germany. This drew strong rebukes from Jewish groups within South Africa.",

  "text" : "John William Hugill (October 3, 1881 – January 13, 1971) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as Attorney General of the province of Alberta from 1935 until 1937. Born in England, he came to Canada and studied law before setting up a practice in Calgary. He became a prominent resident of that city, and served two years on its city council. In the early 1930s, he was one of the few prominent and respectable Calgarians to support William Aberhart's Social Credit League. He ran as a candidate for it in the 1935 provincial election and, when it won, was named Attorney General by Aberhart. Hugill's time as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was dominated by differences of opinion with Aberhart. Hugill did not believe that social credit could be legally implemented by a provincial government and did not support the government's attempts to do so. When asked by Lieutenant Governor John Campbell Bowen whether he considered three of the government's acts to be constitutional, he replied honestly that he did not; this prompted Aberhart to request his resignation. Thereafter Hugill was an outspoken opponent of the Aberhart government, though he did not seek re-election in the 1940 election. He retired from the practice of law in 1949, and died in 1971.",

  "text" : "Earl Russell Browder (May 20, 1891 – June 27, 1973) was an American political activist, functionary and leader of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Browder is best remembered as the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s. During World War I, Browder served time in federal prison as a conscientious objector to conscription and the war. Upon his release, Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the Communist International and its Red International of Labor Unions in China and the Pacific region. In 1930, following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership, Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA. For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American Communism, authoring dozens of pamphlets and books, making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences, and twice running for President of the United States. Browder also took part in clandestine activities on behalf of Soviet intelligence in America during his period of party leadership, placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence. In the wake of public outrage over the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact, Browder was indicted for passport fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942 the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity. Browder was a staunch adherent of close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II and envisioned continued cooperation between these two military powers in the postwar years. Coming to see the role of American Communists to be that of an organized pressure group within a broad governing coalition, in 1944 he directed the transformation of the CPUSA into a \"Communist Political Association.\" However, following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Cold War and internal red scare quickly sprouted up. Browder was expelled from the re-established Communist Party early in 1946, due largely to a refusal to modify these views to accord with changing political realities and their associated ideological demands. Browder lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity at his home in Yonkers, New York, attempting with little success to influence American government policy and public opinion as the author of numerous books and pamphlets.",

Capps lost an election to Andrea Seastrand for the 22nd district in California in 1994, which was a landslide year for the Republicans. While driving home from a campaign event during the summer of 1996, Capps' vehicle was struck by a drunk driver. Capps was seriously injured and was unable to actively campaign until the final few weeks of the race. During his absence from the campaign, his opponent, graciously, didn't make his failing health an issue. Ultimately, despite his absence from the campaign trail, Capps won, even as Bob Dole edged Bill Clinton in the district. Capps died of a heart attack at Dulles Airport only nine months into his term. The Reverend Jesse Jackson attended his funeral. Capps was succeeded by his widow, Lois Capps, who won in a special election in the spring of 1998. Subsequent legislation by Congresswoman Capps has mandated the presence of AEDs in public places. Before entering politics, Capps taught for more than thirty years at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a Professor in the Religious Studies department he helped define the field, and cataloged the growth and changes in his 1995 book Religious Studies: The Making of a Discipline. An anti-war activist during the 1960s, he later initiated a nationally renowned course titled \"Religion and the Impact of Vietnam\" in 1979. His name lives on in the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",

He resigned as leader after his second election defeat, and was replaced by his former deputy, Jeff Seeney. However, after only 16 months as leader and facing poor opinion polling against Seeney, Springborg replaced him. Following this defeat Springborg played a leading role in the creation of the Liberal National Party (LNP), becoming the party's first leader but resigning after he led it to defeat at the 2009 Queensland election. John-Paul Langbroek was elected as his successor, with Springborg elected as Deputy Leader. Following a move by the LNP organisation to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney respectively. The Newman-led LNP overwhelmingly won the 2012 election and Springborg became Minister for Health in the Newman Cabinet. After the 2015 election, Newman lost his electorate of Ashgrove and Springborg was once again elected leader of the LNP, with Langbroek serving as his deputy as the LNP returned to opposition after one term in office. On 6 May 2016, Springborg lost the leadership of the LNP to Tim Nicholls.",

  "text" : "Charles Wendell \"Chuck\" Colson (October 16, 1931 – April 21, 2012) was an Evangelical Christian leader who founded Prison Fellowship and BreakPoint. Prior to his conversion to Christianity, he served as Special Counsel to President Richard Nixon from 1969 to 1973. Once known as President Nixon's \"hatchet man,\" Colson gained notoriety at the height of the Watergate scandal, for being named as one of the Watergate Seven, and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for attempting to defame Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg. In 1974, he served seven months in the federal Maxwell Prison in Alabama as the first member of the Nixon administration to be incarcerated for Watergate-related charges. Colson became a Christian in 1973. His mid-life conversion to Christianity sparked a radical life change that led to the founding of his non-profit ministry Prison Fellowship and to a focus on Christian worldview teaching and training. Colson was also a public speaker and the author of more than 30 books. He was the founder and chairman of The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which is \"a research, study, and networking center for growing in a Christian worldview\", and while he was alive included Colson's daily radio commentary, BreakPoint, which was heard in its original format on more than 1,400 outlets across the United States. Colson was a principal signer of the 1994 Evangelicals and Catholics Together ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholic leaders in the United States. Colson received 15 honorary doctorates, and in 1993 was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the world's largest annual award (over US$1 million) in the field of religion, given to a person who \"has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension\". He donated this prize to further the work of Prison Fellowship, as he did all his speaking fees and royalties. In 2008, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush.",

Wells est d'abord entré en politique en 1966 lorsqu'il fut élu à la Chambre d'Assemblée en tant que député libéral, servant dans le cabinet de Joey Smallwood jusqu'en 1968 lorsqu'il démissionna pour protester contre le caractère autoritaire de Smallwood. Wells quitta la politique en 1971 et revint à sa pratique légale, ayant développé une expertise en droit constitutionnel. En 1987, il fit son retour dans la scène politique pour être élu chef des libéraux, qui étaient restés dans les bancs de l'Opposition pendant plus d'une décennie. En 1989, il mena son parti à la victoire, mettant fin à dix-sept années de gouvernement par les conservateurs. En tant que premier ministre, Wells s'est opposé à l'accord du lac Meech, s'objectant à la provision légale de société distincte pour le Québec. Wells permit à la Chambre d'Assemblée de voter sur l'accord, mais lorsque l'opposition d'Elijah Harper au Manitoba empêcha la ratification par sa province, Wells annula le vote planifié. Wells comprima le budget provincial et tenta de privatiser le service hydro-électrique détenu par la province, mais il ne put aller devant avec la privatisation en raison d'une forte opposition populaire. Wells démissionna de son poste de premier ministre en 1996. Le premier ministre Jean Chrétien le nomma chef de la cour d'appel (en) de Terre-Neuve en 1998.",

In October 2014, she surpassed Kathy Sullivan's record for the longest period of parliamentary service by a woman. From July 2015, Bishop was subject to sustained intense media and public scrutiny regarding her use of parliamentary entitlements, including a helicopter charter to a party fundraiser during her time as speaker. Although Prime Minister Tony Abbott had originally been one of her strongest allies, she eventually lost his support, resigning from the speakership and moving to the backbench on 2 August to be replaced as speaker by Tony Smith. On 16 April 2016, Bishop was defeated by Jason Falinski in a Liberal Party preselection ballot (51 votes to 39) for the Division of Mackellar at the 2016 federal election.",

In 1999, Woodside resigned as mayor to run for MLA of the Fredericton North riding (No. 43) for the Liberal party. He lost to Peter Forbes of the Progressive Conservatives. Woodside ran for mayor again in 2004 and won. As mayor, Woodside can count a range of accomplishments, including promoting information technology in Fredericton, and the development of information technology infrastructure such as the Fred eZone wireless zone. During his tenure as mayor, music festivals have been promoted in Fredericton including the Harvest and Blues Jazz Festival, the Country Music Festival, and FredRock. While infill development and sustainability have been priorities of his tenure as mayor, he has also faced controversy over sprawling box-store development in the university woods, a previously protected wooded area. Woodside received an honorary doctor of laws degree from St. Thomas University in 2011. Eleven professors at the small liberal arts university protested, in part because of his refusal to proclaim Pride Weekend in the 1990s.

  "text" : "Thomas J. \"Tom\" Bradley (December 29, 1917 – September 29, 1998) was the 38th Mayor of Los Angeles, serving from 1973 to 1993. He was the only African-American mayor of that city, and his 20 years in office mark the longest tenure by any mayor in the city's history. His 1973 election made him the second African-American mayor of a major U.S. city. Bradley retired in 1993, after his approval ratings began dropping subsequent to the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. Bradley unsuccessfully ran for Governor of California in 1982 and 1986 and was defeated each time by the Republican George Deukmejian. The racial dynamics that appeared to underlie his narrow and unexpected loss in 1982 gave rise to the political term \"the Bradley effect.\" In 1985, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.",

  "text" : "Thomas Michael \"Tom\" Apodaca is a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state's forty-eighth Senate district, including constituents in Buncombe, Henderson, and Transylvania counties. He was reelected in 2010. Tom Apodaca is a businessman and state legislator. He currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. His wife Lisa is a former public school teacher; they have been married for over 30 years and have two sons. All four Apodacas are graduates of Western Carolina University, where Tom served as a member of the board of trustees. Apodaca was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 2002 during his first campaign for public office; he was re-elected by his Western North Carolina constituents in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. In addition to chairing the Senate Rules Committee, he co-chairs the Committee on Insurance, the Committee on Pensions & Retirement and Aging and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education & Higher Education. In response to public outcry after a coal ash spill into the Dan River in northern North Carolina from a facility owned by Duke Energy Inc., Apodaca said he planned to draft legislation in May 2014 to require Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash ponds, including the one in Buncombe County. He told the Hendersonville Times-News on February 12: \"I don't want a containment plan, I want a plan to get rid of it. ... We need a five- to 10-year plan to get rid of them because we don't need it sitting there next to the river.\" Over the court of his time in politics, Apodaca has accepted over $65,000 from organizations representing Duke Energy and Progress Energy. 61 In the 2013 legislative session, Apodaca introduced and voted for a bill, Senate Bill 10, to reorganize the Environmental Management Commission and the N.C. Utilities Commission and replace the members with new appointees. This Bill included the elimination of dozens of obsolete and rarely convened boards and commissions. Senate Bill 10 was not signed into law in 2013. Sen. Tom Apodaca said his main complaint to the House version was that it strikes language that would fire 12 special superior court judges. 60 In May 2013, after receiving the maximum $8000 contribution from North Carolina Automobile Dealers Association, Apodaca sponsored legislation that would make it illegal for any car maker to bypass dealerships and sell directly to consumers in North Carolina. Apodaca's proposal was widely criticized as anti-competitive and aimed at insulating automobile dealers from Tesla Motors' business model. In March 2016, Apodaca led a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly that passed the controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act commonly known as HB2. After this session of congress, Apodaca called on the city of Charlotte to pay the $42,000 cost of the emergency legislative session which led to the bill's passage. After the controversial bill passed, companies such as PayPal withdrew their plans to expand in North Carolina, resulting in the loss of at least four hundred potential jobs for North Carolinians.",

Prior to being elected Governor, Bickett practiced law in Louisburg, represented Franklin County in the North Carolina General Assembly and then served as North Carolina Attorney General for two terms (1909–1917). In 1916, Bickett became the first state governor who was nominated by means of a Democratic Party primary election (in which he defeated Lt. Gov. Elijah L. Daughtridge). Under Bickett's leadership, the state saw improvements in child welfare, public health, electricity, and running water. He persuaded the legislature to establish the state's first income tax.

Später schloss er ein Aufbaustudium an der Handelshochschule Warschau (SGH) ab. Ab 1990 war er als selbständiger Unternehmer tätig. Im selben Jahr wurde Tomczykiewicz in den Rat seiner Heimatstadt gewählt und Mitglied des Vorstandes, was er bis 1998 blieb. Als Kandidat für die Akcja Wyborcza Solidarność bewarb sich Tomasz Tomczykiewicz 1997 um ein Mandat für den Sejm, 5300 Stimmen reichten aber nicht für den Einzug. Im Jahr darauf wurde er in den Rat des Sejmiks der Woiwodschaft Schlesien gewählt. Im November 1998 wurde er zugleich Bürgermeister seiner Heimatstadt. Bei den Parlamentswahlen 2001 konnte Tomczykiewicz, als Kandidat der Platforma Obywatelska, erstmals in den Sejm einziehen. Auch bei den Wahlen 2005 und den vorgezogenen Wahlen 2007 war seine Kandidatur erfolgreich. Er arbeitete im Sejm in der Kommission für Territoriale Selbstverwaltung und der Wirtschaftskommission mit. Weiterhin war er seit Januar 2008 Mitglied der Untersuchungskommission zum Tod der Abgeordneten Barbara Blida. Am 22. Juli 2010 wurde er zum Fraktionsvorsitzenden der Bürgerplattform gewählt und führte diese Funktion bis zum Ende der sechsten Legislaturperiode des Sejms aus. In den Parlamentswahlen von 2011 erlangte er als Kandidat im Wahlbezirk Katowice erneut einen Abgeordnetensitz. Im Dezember desselben Jahres wurde er zum Staatssekretär im Wirtschaftsministerium unter Regierungschef Donald Tusk ernannt. 2015 zog er nochmals in den Sejm ein.

Daley was Chicago's third consecutive mayor from the working-class, heavily Irish American Bridgeport neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, where he lived his entire life. Daley is remembered for doing much to avoid the declines that some other \"rust belt\" cities like Cleveland, Buffalo and Detroit experienced during the same period. He had a strong base of support in Chicago's Irish Catholic community, and he was treated by national politicians such as Lyndon B. Johnson as a pre-eminent Irish American, with special connections to the Kennedy family. Daley played a major role in the history of the Democratic Party, especially with his support of John F. Kennedy in 1960 and of Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Daley is the father of Richard M. Daley, also a former mayor of Chicago, William M. Daley, a former United States Secretary of Commerce, and John P. Daley, a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. While many members of Daley's administration were charged with corruption and convicted, Daley was never charged with corruption.",

He was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election, and was re-elected to his council seat twice. His political career, particularly his mayoralty, saw a number of personal and work-related controversies and legal proceedings. In 2013, he became embroiled in a substance abuse scandal, which was widely reported in the national and international media. Following his admission, Ford refused to resign, but City Council handed over certain mayoral powers and office staff to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. Despite the scandal, Ford initially contested the next mayoral election, scheduled for October 2014, but after being hospitalized and diagnosed with an abdominal tumour in September 2014, Ford withdrew from the mayoral race and registered instead to run for his old city council seat. John Tory succeeded him as mayor on December 1, 2014, while Ford regained his former seat. Ford received treatment for the cancer, and was able to return to City Hall for a while, but died in March 2016 after chemotherapy was ineffective.",

Brawley ran for North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance in 2004, losing to James E. Long. In 2012, Brawley was again elected to the House from the Iredell County-based 95th district. He won the May 8 Republican primary, which was tantamount to election, since no Democrat filed for the seat. Meanwhile, Brawley was also in 2012 named to lead the North Carolina chapter of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. In April 2013, Brawley filed House Bill 640 that would allow lobbyists to give unreported gifts to state lawmakers in North Carolina. In May 2013, Brawley resigned as chairman of the House Finance Committee in a dispute with House Speaker Thom Tillis. Brawley lost his bid for another term in the May 2014 Republican primary, with some of his colleagues in the House campaigning against him. Afterwards, the House Republican Caucus passed a vote of \"no confidence\" in Brawley, effectively barring him from caucus meetings. Brawley suggested that the censure was in retaliation for his criticism of Tillis. On December 9, 2015, Brawley announced his candidacy for the office of Governor of North Carolina, challenging current governor Pat McCrory.",

  "text" : "Robert Anthony Furolo (born 27 July 1969) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2008 to 2015, representing the electorate of Lakemba. Furolo was born in Sydney, and grew up in its outer western suburbs. He worked in the transport industry after leaving school, working as a McDonalds manager for a period, before returning to university to study economics and industrial relations. He was appointed as an advisor to his local MLA, member for Hurstville and future Premier Morris Iemma in 1994. He worked for Iemma for nine years, remaining on his staff after his appointment as a minister in 1999, before leaving to work as a public relations consultant in 2003. Furolo was elected to the City of Canterbury council in 1999, and served a stint as its deputy mayor before standing for mayor in the 2004 election. He won that election, and was re-elected in 2008, recording one of the few swings to the Labor Party in an election where the party faced widespread losses across the state. One week before his re-election as mayor, on 5 September 2008, Iemma resigned as Premier, resulting in widespread speculation that he would resign as the member for Lakemba. After delaying an announcement for two weeks, Iemma announced on 19 September that he would indeed retire; a move reportedly attributed to his efforts to see Furolo, his preferred choice, endorsed as his successor. Furolo subsequently won Labor preselection for what had been Labor's safest seat in the state, and easily won the seat, polling more than 58% of the primary vote, despite a 15-point swing against Labor. He was sworn in as a member of the Legislative Assembly on 18 October, and as a member of the Legislative Review Committee on 30 October. In October 2010, Furolo borrowed a Lamborghini (reportedly valued at $400,000) from local businessmen, \"the Kazzi brothers\", for the purposes of a \"joyride\". Furolo slightly damaged the vehicle but was unhurt. No other vehicles were involved in the accident and no one was hurt.",

In 1964 he moved to Edmonton to work on a graduate program, completing a Ph.D. in sociology in 1973. He taught at York University for one year (1968–69) before returning to the University of Alberta, where he taught for 27 years until his retirement in 1996. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Alberta. He entered provincial politics in 1997 when he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. Raj became leader in February 2000 after the previous leader, Pam Barrett, retired from politics. Pannu ran a high-profile campaign in the 2001 Alberta election. T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Raj Against the Machine\", as well as a reputation as a \"likeable and honest politician\" contributed to his popularity and made him a leader well respected by supporters and non-supporters alike. He announced on July 13, 2004 that he was resigning as party leader. Fellow MLA Brian Mason, the deputy leader, became interim leader. Mason was formally elected leader in a leadership convention held on September 18. However, he sought re-election as an MLA in the 26th Alberta general election, and was re-elected by a wide margin. On June 14, 2006, he announced his retirement from Alberta politics at the dissolution of the legislature, which took place in February 2008.",

Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie Gildea issued a statement on the death of former Justice Wahl: \"Rosalie Wahl was a trailblazer for our state, both as a lawyer and as the first woman to serve on the Minnesota Supreme Court. While on the court she led efforts to address both gender fairness and racial bias in our state’s justice system. She will be remembered with fondness and respect for her unwavering commitment to the principle of equal justice for all.\" In an interview with Peter Shea done in 2003 she talks about her post-retirement role as a \"public citizen,\" including her work as a peace activist. Wahl also served as an adjunct professor at William Mitchell College of Law and the University of Minnesota Law School.

  "text" : "Rolf Wallgren Bruhn (September 4, 1878 – August 30, 1942) was a Swedish-born farmer, lumberman and political figure in British Columbia. He represented Salmon Arm in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1924 to 1942 as a Conservative. He was born Rolf Wallgren in Resterod parish, in 1878, the son of Axel Wallgren. His father, a Crown Reeve in Sweden, was accused of embezzlement in 1890 and subsequently adopted the surname Bruhn and went to Canada, leaving his family behind. The family moved to Göteborg, where his mother operated a bakery. In 1894, Rolf left school and worked as a deckhand on freighters. He won a sailboat in a raffle in 1895; he gave most of the money to his mother and bought a ticket to Canada. There, like his father, he adopted the surname Bruhn. Bruhn worked as a sailor on the Great Lakes; moving west, he worked on the railway and as a miner and logger. In 1898, he settled in Malakwa, British Columbia. Bruhn married Anna Treat in 1902. Bruhn supplemented his income from farming with road contract work. In 1910, he moved with his family to Salmon Arm, working as a road foreman and then road superintendent. He also served four years as an alderman. Bruhn lost his position of road superintendent after the Liberals were elected in 1916. He moved to Sicamous, where he established a business producing cedar poles. Bruhn was badly burned in a fire and, for a time, his wife managed the company. The company expanded, building a lumber mill at Canoe and addling logs and railway ties to its products. He was named to the Conservative cabinet as President of the Executive Council in 1928 and as Minister of Public Works in 1930. Bruhn helped draft the platform for the Social Constructive Party in 1937 and, although he ran as an Independent candidate in the 1937 general election, he was endorsed by the Constructives. The Social Constructive Party was not successful and Bruhn ran again as a Conservative in 1941. Later that year, he was again Minister of Public Works in a Liberal/Conservative coalition government. Bruhn suffered a stroke and died in office the following year.",

James, who was elected Mayor of San Jose, California in 1967, served as the city's first popularly elected mayor from 1967 until 1971. He retired from office in 1971 after one term and was succeeded by then-San Jose Vice Mayor Norm Mineta. In 1970, Mayor James submitted a letter addressed to a future mayor, which was placed in a time capsule buried at San Jose's former main library on West San Carlos Street on May 14, 1970. Other artifacts included with James' letter included a copy of the San Jose city charter, a city council agenda from 1969, newspaper clippings, and a taped radio interview with city librarian Geraldine Nurney, which was recorded at the library's dedication in April 1970. James had been told that the time capsule would remain buried for about 100 years, so he assumed he wouldn't live to see it reopened. However, the old main library was demolished in 2011, which allowed for the capsule's recovery. The time capsule was opened in September 2013 and James' letter was reprinted in its entirety in the San Jose Mercury News. James remarked at the ceremony, \"They told me it was going to be opened in 100 years or longer...I was pleasantly surprised that the Mercury News printed the letter verbatim so people could read it. Now, I'm just happy to still be here.\"",

In 1979 werd hij voorzitter van de Tweede Kamer, als opvolger van partijgenoot Anne Vondeling. Dolman stelde zich onafhankelijk op, en had daardoor een groot gezag bij alle partijen. Hoewel de PvdA niet de grootste partij was bij de verkiezingen van 1981 en 1986 werd hij toch herkozen als voorzitter. In 1989 werd hij echter verslagen door CDA'er Wim Deetman met 75 stemmen tegen 68. Nog geen jaar later, op 1 juli 1990, verliet Dolman het parlement om lid van de Raad van State te worden.",

She was the city's first female mayor. Wyatt first worked as a secretary, meeting her husband Donald Wyatt while working for American Overseas Airlines in Gander. She later returned to Memorial University of Newfoundland to study nursing. Wyatt first won election to St. John's City Council in 1969 as the city's first female alderman. She ran for the mayoralty in 1973, winning the election and serving two terms in office. Her term as mayor was marked by accomplishments including the city's hosting of the Canada Summer Games in 1977, a shift from rental-value to capital-value municipal tax assessment, the adoption of a ward system for city council elections, and the construction of many of the city's modern office buildings. Wyatt was defeated by John Joseph Murphy in the 1981 election. She was later reelected as a councillor at large in 1985, and remained a sitting member of city council until her death; she died just two days before the city's 2001 municipal election, and was posthumously reelected to her seat on September 25. A by-election was held on November 27 of that year, and was won by Sandy Hickman. She was a candidate for provincial office twice, running as an independent candidate in St. John's Centre and later for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in the party's 1979 leadership convention. In the PC race, she garnered no votes (she didn't even vote for herself, admitting that she had run more \"to shake things up\" than out of a serious desire to actually lead the party) and was eliminated on the first ballot. Wyatt revelled in a quirky and offbeat public image, once telling a reporter that she hoped to be classified \"as a freak, I suppose\".",

His most notable duty was as commander of the Snowbirds Air Demonstration Team - 431 Squadron. In 1986, he was made an Officer of the Order of Military Merit. In 1997, he ran for the leadership of the fledgling Saskatchewan Party. He finished 3rd among three candidates. In 1999, in his first run at public office, he narrowly lost election in the Wood River constituency as the Saskatchewan Party candidate. On election night, he tied Liberal candidate Glen McPherson. The returning officer cast the deciding vote in favour of McPherson. This result was later thrown out in court and a by-election was ordered. McPherson did not run and Huyghebaert then won a resounding victory. He was re-elected in 2003.

  "text" : "Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky's Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems. Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia's Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title \"the players' commissioner\". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951. Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor.",

  "text" : "Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd (8 September 1901 – 6 September 1966), also known as Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, was a South African Psychology and Philosophy scholar, Afrikaans newspaper editor-in-chief and Prime Minister of South Africa. He is regarded as the mastermind behind socially engineering and implementing the racial policies of apartheid, the system of legal racial classification and forced racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. Verwoerd rigidly enforced Apartheid policies through further introducing oppressive laws, which diminished the rights of ordinary individuals especially black South Africans. Verwoerd empowered the police, Secret Police and Army to extraordinary levels. During his time in office he ordered a secret all-out offensive against those opposed to apartheid policies and as a result tens of thousands people were arrested, jailed and or sent into exile. People were also tortured and killed (Sharpeville massacre) during his time in office. Verwoerd was a right wing authoritarian leader and Afrikaner nationalist. He was a strong advocate of the Afrikaner volk, language, culture and Christian religion. He held that white control over South Africa could only continue if the races lived apart. He survived an assassination attempt in 1960, succumbing to a subsequent one in 1966. Prior to entering politics, Verwoerd was regarded as a brilliant social science professor at Stellenbosch University. He completed his undergraduate studies with distinctions majoring in sociology, psychology and philosophy. Verwoerd continued his studies completing his master's (cum laude) and doctorate in social psychology and philosophy. As a result of his academic performance, Verwoerd received a post-doctoral scholarship from the University of Oxford, but turned it down and continued his research in the fields of sociology and philosophy at various German universities. Upon his return to South Africa, he was appointed professor of Applied Psychology at Stellenbosch University at the age of 26. He was then later appointed as head of the sociology department in 1933. Verwoerd was prime minister during the establishment of the Republic of South Africa in 1961, thereby fulfilling the Afrikaner dream of an independent republic for South Africans. During his tenure as prime minister, anti-apartheid movements such as the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) were banned, and the Rivonia Trial, which prosecuted ANC leaders, was held. His term ended with his assassination on 6 September 1966 by Dimitri Tsafendas. Many major roads, places and facilities in cities and towns of South Africa were named after Verwoerd; in post-apartheid South Africa, most of these references to the creator of apartheid have been renamed. Famous examples include H. F. Verwoerd Airport in Port Elizabeth, renamed Port Elizabeth Airport, the Verwoerd Dam in the Free State, now the Gariep Dam, H. F. Verwoerd Academic Hospital in Pretoria, now Steve Biko Hospital, and the town of Verwoerdburg, now Centurion.",

Lainson was a longtime party member and stood as a Social Credit candidate during the 1962 federal election in the riding of St. John—Albert, New Brunswick. He led the Ontario Social Credit Party during the 1967 general election and was its candidate in Kitchener. He won the party's June 1986 leadership convention defeating Keegstra by a margin of 67 vote to 38. Lainson hoped to rename the party Christian Freedom since he thought people mistook the name \"social credit\" for socialist and rebuild the party with the support of Christian fundamentalists He faced resistance from the onset of his leadership with Keegstra's supporters insisting that Lainson was part of a conspiracy and pledging to obstruct him. \"We're going to stonewall this guy. There's no way we're going to do business with him. As far as we're concerned, this bunch is part of the conspiracy,\" said one Keegstra supporter. and was temporarily deposed as party leader in 1987 in favour of Keegstra. Refusing to resign, Lainson's leadership was reconfirmed at a party convention later in 1987 and he succeeded in expelling Keegstra from the party. Lainson led the party through the 1988 federal election in which the depleted party ran only nine candidates and received only 3,407 votes, in what would be its final and worst ever performance in a general election. Lainson did not contest a parliamentary seat. He resigned as party leader in 1990 for unspecified \"personal reasons\" and was succeeded by another evangelical minister, Ken Campbell. In his business life, Lainson operated a computer services company for Christian charities in Ottawa.",

  "text" : "Oliver Hazard Perry Throck Morton (August 4, 1823 – November 1, 1877), commonly known as Oliver P. Morton, was a U.S. Republican Party politician from Indiana. He served as the 14th Governor of Indiana during the American Civil War, and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln. During the war, Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly. He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval, and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans. He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers. As one of President Lincoln's \"war governors\", Morton made signification contributions to the war effort, more than any other man in the state, and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support. During his second term as governor, and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke, he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during his second term in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.",

After completing his diploma he went to the National University of Malaysia and graduated with Bachelor of Marketing Studies. He subsequently held a number of positions in corporate enterprises. In the 2004 general election, Othman was elected to the state assembly of Kedah, defeating the incumbent Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) assemblyman Abdul Ghani Ahmad by 860 votes in the seat of Ayer Hitam. In 2005 he was appointed to the Executive Council of the Kedah state government by the incoming Chief Minister Mahdzir Khalid. During this time he also managed the Kedah Football Association. He was a casualty of the Barisan Nasional state government's defeat in the 2008 election, as he lost his seat by 506 votes to his predecessor, Abdul Ghani.

  "text" : "Sir Richard Stafford Cripps, CH, PC, FRS (24 April 1889 – 21 April 1952) was a British Labour politician of the first half of the 20th century. A wealthy barrister by background, he entered Parliament at a by-election in 1931, and was one of a handful of Labour front-benchers to retain his seat in the general election that autumn. He became a leading spokesman for the left and cooperation in a Popular Front with Communists before 1939, in which year he was expelled from the Labour Party. During World War II he served as Ambassador to the USSR (1940–42), during which time he grew wary of the Soviet Union, but achieved great public popularity because of the entry of the USSR into the war, causing him to be seen in 1942 as a potential rival to Churchill for the premiership. He became a member of the War Cabinet of the wartime coalition, but failed in his efforts (the \"Cripps Mission\") to resolve the wartime crisis in India, where his proposals were too radical for Churchill and the cabinet, and too conservative for Gandhi and other Indian leaders. He later served as Minister of Aircraft Production, an important post but outside the inner War Cabinet. Rejoining the Labour Party in 1945, after the war he served in the Attlee Ministry, firstly as President of the Board of Trade and between 1947 and 1950 as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the latter position, Cripps was responsible for laying the foundations of Britain’s post-war economic prosperity, and was, according to historian Kenneth O. Morgan, “the real architect of the rapidly improving economic picture and growing affluence from 1952 onwards.” The economy improved after 1947, benefiting from the American money given through the Marshall Plan, but was hurt by the forced devaluation of the pound in 1949. He kept rationing in place to hold down consumption during an \"age of austerity,\" promoted exports, and maintained full employment with static wages. The public especially respected \"his integrity, competence, and Christian principles.\"",

  "text" : "Sherwood Hayes Rideout (July 17, 1917 - May 29, 1964) was a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Westmorland from 1962 until his death in 1964. Prior to his election to the Canadian House of Commons, he was the mayor of the City of Moncton. During World War 2, Rideout acted as a train-master and was considered a key figure in the management of the train system and logistics planning that allowed vehicles, supplies and troop transports to be shipped through Moncton (known as the Hub City) to the port in Halifax. A Liberal, he was elected in the 1962 election. Following his death, on a train bound for Moncton from Ottawa, he was succeeded by his widow Margaret, the first woman from New Brunswick to be elected to the House of Commons. Their son George also served in the House of Commons in the 1990s.",

  "text" : "Major James William Coldwell, PC CC (December 2, 1888 – August 25, 1974), usually known as M.J. (Major was his first name, not a military title), was a Canadian social democratic politician, and leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) party from 1942 to 1960. He was born in England, and immigrated to Canada in 1910. Prior to his political career, he was an educator and union activist. In 1935 he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, representing the Rosetown—Biggar electoral district. He would be re-elected five more times until he was defeated in the 1958 Diefenbaker sweep. He was the CCF's first national secretary in 1934, and became its national leader upon the death of J. S. Woodsworth in 1942. He remained as its leader until 1960, when there was a parliamentary caucus revolt against him. When the CCF was disbanded 1961, he joined its successor party, the NDP. He is mainly remembered for helping to introduce \"welfare state\" policies to Canada, by persuading the Canadian government to introduce an Old Age Security programme, and child benefits during the mid-1940s. Coldwell turned down several offers to cross the floor and join the governing Liberal Party of Canada, including one offer that eventually would have made him the Prime Minister of Canada. After his defeat in 1958, he was offered a Senate appointment, but declined it as well. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1964 and in 1967 became one of the initial inductees into the Order of Canada. After suffering two heart attacks on the same day, he died in Ottawa at the age of 85.",

  "text" : "Marguerite Alice \"Missy\" LeHand (September 13, 1898 – July 31, 1944) was private secretary to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) for 21 years. According to Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, during FDR's presidency, LeHand became \"the most celebrated private secretary in the country\". Born into a poor Irish-American family in New York, LeHand attended secretarial school, took a series of clerical jobs, and eventually began to work for the Democratic Party's New York office. There she came to the attention of FDR's wife Eleanor during his 1920 vice presidential candidacy and was hired as FDR's personal secretary. After FDR was partially paralyzed by polio, LeHand became his daily companion, to the extent of adopting his favorite hobbies, games, and drinks. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her unable to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Boston and died in 1944. The exact nature of LeHand's relationship with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was engaged to U.S. Ambassador William Bullitt in 1933, but never married, later asking a friend, \"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\"",

  "text" : "Dato' Seri Mohamed Nazri bin Abdul Aziz (born 15 May 1954) is a Malaysian politician from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), and is as of 2008 a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of affairs. In June 2005 Nazri caused controversy when he shouted the phrase \"racist\" (or variants of it) 28 times in Parliament. A request by opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) lawmaker Fong Po Kuan for Nazri to take back his comments went unheeded. The incident occurred during a debate on the Malaysian Medical Council's derecognition of Crimea State Medical University (CSMU) medical degrees; most Malaysian students sent to study there were of Indian extraction. Nazri has since used the phrase \"bloody racist\" on Tun Dr. Mahathir because the latter supports a controversial government programme that allegedly indoctrinates racist sentiments in civil servants and public university students. Nazri was originally also the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of legal affairs and judicial reform. After the 2008 general election, which saw the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition's majority in Parliament significantly reduced, the then Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi reshuffled his Cabinet and gave Nazri's legal affairs portfolio to Zaid Ibrahim. He has also recently (2006) been called the hatchetman of Abdullah, then Prime Minister of Malaysia, by Former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, for defending Abdullah in Mahathir's ongoing criticisms against the government. In September 2010 he came out openly in the defence of Prime Minister Najib's 1Malaysia policy, saying that he is a Malaysian first and a Malay next. This is in complete opposition to that expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister, Muhyiddin bin Mohd. Yassin, who has time and again reiterated that he is Malay first and Malaysian second. He is an alumnus of Malay College Kuala Kangsar.",

Muhyiddin grew up in the state of Johor and joined the state public service after graduating from university. He later took up management positions at various state-owned companies. He joined politics in the 1970s and was elected as Member of Parliament for Pagoh in 1978. During his term as MP, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Federal Territories and later Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry. As Johor UMNO chief, he was Menteri Besar of Johor from 1986 to 1995. He returned to federal politics in 1995 and was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of Youth and Sports. He was appointed Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs after the 1999 general election and became a vice-president of UMNO in 2000. Under the premiership of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Muhyiddin served as Minister of Agriculture (2004–2008) and then Minister of International Trade and Industry (2008–2009). In 2008, he contested and won the UMNO deputy presidency and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education by Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009. As Education Minister, Muhyiddin ended the use of English as the medium of instruction for science and mathematics in public schools. He also attracted controversy after describing himself as \"Malay first\" when challenged by the opposition to pronounce himself as \"Malaysian first.\" During Najib's mid-term Cabinet reshuffle in July 2015, he was dropped from his position, marking the first incumbent to be left out; in June 2016 he was further sacked from UMNO.",

El 17 de junio de 2013, fue arrestado y acusado de 14 cargos que incluyen fraude, conspiración, abuso de confianza y corrupción en asuntos municipales. El 18 de junio anunció su dimisión como alcalde de Montreal, afirmando que las acusaciones en su contra son infundadas.

Upon his death, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to rename City Hall Plaza in his honor as the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The plaza displays a bronze bust of Ogawa. A Nisei, Ogawa was born in Lodi, California and never lived in Japan. Nevertheless, as Japanese Americans, the U.S. government involuntarily relocated Ogawa's family members to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Millard County, Utah and they were detained there for the duration of World War II. Ogawa married Grace Ogawa (née Hiruma) prior to their wartime detention and they had two children—Alan and Nancy. Nancy was born in the Topaz War Relocation Center but died at age 2. After the war, Ogawa returned to Oakland where he found work as a gardener. Eventually, he borrowed and saved enough money to open his own nursery. When Ogawa died, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, in her Tribute to Frank H. Ogawa, said: \"Frank Ogawa was a remarkable person because he could take personal misfortune and turn it into a positive learning experience for himself and others. When Frank and Grace Ogawa were forced to sell their belongings and live in internment camps during World War II, they had to sleep on straw mattresses in horse stalls for six months before beingshipped to a camp in Utah to spend another 3 1/2 years in confinement. Despite this mistreatment and injustice, he never lost faith in the United States. Just the opposite--he strived to prove his loyalty to his country and became an internationally recognized champion of Asian-Americans in the process.\" She went on to say \"Having served five years on the Oakland Parks Commission, Frank Ogawa was elected to the city council in 1966, making him the first Japanese-American to hold a council seat in a major city in the continental United States. He held that position for 28 years until his passing -- the longest tenure in Oakland's history.\" Ogawa was a member of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) from 1972 to 1988, having been appointed to the Commission by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Ogawa served on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors from 1979 until 1992 when he had to retire from the Board because of health issues. He served as Chairman of the Board during most of 1987 and served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Executive Committee and Personnel Committee. Ogawa was a Republican. However, he never held nor was he ever a candidate for any partisan office. As a public official, Ogawa was known as kind, optimistic, and adept at building consensus. In about December 1988, Ogawa underwent successful heart surgery. Ogawa died in Oakland on July 13, 1994, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife Grace, son Alan, and by two grandchildren, Courtney and Matthew. More than 600 people, including a representative of Oakland's sister city of Fukuoka, Japan, attended Ogawa's memorial service.",

As Viceroy of India, he is noted for the creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam. As Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he drew the Curzon Line as the proposed eastern frontier of Poland. He was passed over as Prime Minister in 1923 in favour of Stanley Baldwin. His character polarised opinion amongst his contemporaries, \"sow[ing] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands\". He quarrelled endlessly and his arrogance and inflexibility made even more enemies. Critics have been negative in contrasting his enormous talents and energy on behalf of British imperialism with his mixed results and unrealized ambitions.",

In sein Vaterland zurückgekehrt, wurde er 1782 in der Garde des Erbstatthalters Wilhelm V. angestellt, studierte aber später in Leiden Rechtswissenschaften, stand 1787 während der Unruhen auf oranischer Seite und wurde nach Unterdrückung derselben Pensionär (Stadtschreiber) von Rotterdam, von welchem Posten er nach der Eroberung Hollands durch die Franzosen 1795 zurücktrat, um in Amsterdam ein Kaufmannsgeschäft zu übernehmen. Durch seinen fehlgeschlagenen Plan, eine Kolonie für die Anhänger des Hauses Oranien am Kap der Guten Hoffnung zu gründen, büßte er den größten Teil seines Vermögens ein; dagegen trug er 1813 wesentlich zur Befreiung Hollands vom französischen Okkupation bei, indem er, als die Verbündeten siegreich vordrangen, die Anhänger des Prinzen von Oranien in Den Haag vereinigte. Als Präsident der Kommission, welche mit der Entwerfung der neuen Verfassungsurkunde beauftragt war, übte er einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die übrigen Kommissionsmitglieder aus, so dass er der Haupturheber des niederländischen Staatsgrundgesetzes war. Darauf erhielt er das Departement der auswärtigen Angelegenheiten, wurde Vizepräsident des Staatsrats und 1815 Graf, nahm aber schon 1816 wegen Kränklichkeit seine Entlassung. Als Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Generalstaaten, in die er 1815 gewählt worden war, gehörte er zur Opposition gegen den Minister van Maanen. Auf seinen Platz in der Ersten Kammer verzichtete er, weil die Verhandlungen derselben nicht öffentlich waren. Er war vom 20. September 1815 bis 22. Mai 1819 Staatsminister der Niederlande, wurde dann aber wegen Kritik an der Finanzpolitik Wilhelm I. der Niederlande dieses Titels enthoben. Er ist einer von nur sechs niederländischen Staatsministern bei denen das der Fall war. Er starb am 5. August 1834 im Haag. Er schrieb: \"Über den Handel nach Indien\" (1801, 2 Bde.), \"Memoiren über den Handel nach Java\" (1804), \"Beiträge zur Staatshaushaltung des Königreichs der Niederlande\" (Delft 1818-29, 10 Bde.; 2.

During his city council tenure, Schiff worked to ease ordinances prohibitive to small businesses, especially microbreweries, and strongly advocated against a publicly funded stadium for the Minnesota Vikings. In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for Mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 election but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June.

  "text" : "Paul Reynaud (French: [pɔl ʁɛjno]; 15 October 1878 – 21 September 1966) was a French politician and lawyer prominent in the interwar period, noted for his stances on economic liberalism and militant opposition to Germany. He was the penultimate Prime Minister of the Third Republic and vice-president of the Democratic Republican Alliance center-right party. After the outbreak of war and the collapse of French resistance in 1940, Reynaud persistently refused to support an armistice with Germany and resigned. After unsuccessfully attempting to flee France, he was arrested by Philippe Petain's administration. Surrendered to German custody in 1942, he was imprisoned in Germany and later Austria until liberation in 1945. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946, he became a prominent figure again in French political life, serving in several cabinet positions. He favoured a United States of Europe, and participated in drafting the constitution for the Fifth Republic, but resigned from government in 1962 after disagreement with President de Gaulle over changes to the electoral system.",

  "text" : "Pieter Mattheus Kruger le Roux (né le 11 novembre 1904 à Doornkraal, De Rust, colonie du Cap et mort le 23 juin 1985 à Wilderness, province du Cap en Afrique du Sud) est un homme politique sud-africain, membre du parti national, membre du parlement de 1948 à 1978, et ministre de 1958 à 1972 dans les gouvernements Strijdom, Verwoerd et Vorster. Né sur la ferme familiale de Doornkraal, son père rajoute le patronyme de Kruger au nom de famille par admiration pour le président Paul Kruger. Après ses études secondaires à George, P.M.K. Le Roux commence des études supérieures en agriculture à l'Université de Stellenbosch (1922) qu'il doit interrompre à la fin de la première année pour aider son père à la ferme, malmené par la sécheresse et la dépression économique. En 1928, il épouse Emily Hobouse (Hobbie) Schoeman (1906-1980) avec qui il a 3 enfants. Il se consacre à l'agriculture pendant plusieurs années et a de nombreuses responsabilités syndicales. Membre notamment de l'association locale et de l'association nationale des agriculteurs, il est le fondateur et le président de la coopération agricole du petit Karoo. Il est également secrétaire de la section du Parti national à De Rust. Lors d'une élection partielle en avril 1942, il se fait élire au parlement en remportant le siège de Riversdale après la mort du titulaire sortant. Un an plus tard, lors des élections générales, candidat sur la circonscription de Bredasdorp, il est battu par Pieter Voltelyn Graham van der Byl (parti uni). En 1948, P.M.K. Le Roux est élu au parlement cette fois sur la circonscription de Victoria Ouest. Aux élections générales suivantes, à la suite du redécoupage électoral, il se fait élire dans la circonscription de Oudtshoorn et monte en grade au sein du parti national. En mai 1958, il entre au gouvernement Strijdom en tant que ministre de l'agriculture. De 1958 à 1966, au sein du gouvernement Verwoerd, il est successivement ou cumulativement ministre de l'Agriculture, ministre des Services Techniques Agricoles et ministre des Eaux. Durant cette période, il met en œuvre un certain nombre de barrages et de systèmes hydrauliques visant à capter ou domestiquer les cours d'eau dont celui du fleuve Orange. De 1966 à 1968, au sein du gouvernement Vorster, il est ministre de l'intérieur. Démissionnaire du gouvernement en 1972, il reste encore député du Parti national jusqu'à sa retraite en 1978. P.M.K. Le Roux meurt âgé de 80 ans en 1985. L'actuel barrage de Vanderkloof porta le nom de Barrage P.K. Le Roux de son inauguration en 1977 jusqu'en 1994.",

In 1904, he defeated liberal publisher William Randolph Hearst for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. In the general election, Parker opposed popular incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt. After a disorganized and ineffective campaign, Parker was defeated by 336 electoral votes to 140, carrying only the traditionally Democratic Solid South. He then returned to practicing law.

  "text" : "Alan Kenneth Mackenzie Clark PC (13 April 1928 – 5 September 1999) was a British Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), historian and diarist. He served as a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher's governments at the Departments of Employment, Trade and Defence, and became a privy counsellor in 1991. He was the author of several books of military history, including his controversial work The Donkeys (1961), which is considered to have inspired the musical satire Oh, What a Lovely War! Clark became known for his flamboyance, wit and irreverence. Norman Lamont called him \"the most politically incorrect, outspoken, iconoclastic and reckless politician of our times\". He is particularly remembered for his three-volume diary, a candid account of political life under Thatcher and a moving description of the weeks preceding his death, when he continued to write until he could no longer focus on the page. Clark was a passionate supporter of animal rights, joining activists in demonstrations at Dover against live export, and outside the House of Commons in support of Animal Liberation Front hunger-striker Barry Horne. When he died after radiation therapy for a brain tumour, his family said Clark wanted it to be stated that he had \"gone to join Tom and the other dogs.\"",

Following his resignation he said: Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.\" He opposed Australia's contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government and ran for Parliament against John Howard as a Green's Candidate in 2004. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a \"lie\". Since 2003 he has been active in Australian politics. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences.

Taib was also the President of Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), which is part of the Barisan Nasional coalition. He is of ethnic Melanau descent. Taib is informally known as Pak Uban, which translates into \"white-haired uncle\". Among Chinese speaking communities he is known as Pek Moh (白毛) which means \"white hair\". Another informal name for him, in reference to the British Brooke family that ruled Sarawak as White Rajahs in the 19th and early 20th century, is the \"last white rajah\" or \"white-haired rajah\". Holding the post of Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1981 to 2014, he was the longest serving Chief Minister in Malaysia. He assumed the Chief Minister post at the age of 45. Being a member of the Malaysian Parliament for 38 years, Taib is also the second longest-serving parliamentarian in Malaysia after Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Taib and his wider family are regularly accused of corruption and personally benefiting from Sarawak's natural and economic resources. On 12 February 2014, Taib handed over his resignation letter to the Governor of Sarawak to vacate his chief minister post, officially ending his 33 years of chief ministership. His former brother-in-law, Adenan Satem, succeeded him as Chief Minister with effect from 1 March 2014. At the same time, he received the official credentials as the 7th Sarawak Head of State from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at Istana Negara on 28 February, and officially took the oath of office on the following day. He became the second Sarawakian (after his uncle, Abdul Rahman Ya'kub) to be appointed as the Governor after formally relinquishing the post of Chief Minister.",

  "text" : "Alex M. Torpey (born August 10, 1987 in New York City) is a non-party affiliated American politician and consultant. Torpey was elected as the 48th Village President (equivalent of mayor) of South Orange, New Jersey in May 2011 for a four-year term by a 14-vote margin. At the age of 23 years at the time of being sworn in (May 16, 2011), he was the youngest Village President in South Orange’s history, and at that time the youngest serving mayor in the state of New Jersey. Torpey was one of the youngest mayors in the United States to oversee a municipality the size of South Orange, which has 16,000 full-time residents plus approximately 7,000 Seton Hall University students at their South Orange campus. On June 20, 2014, nearly 1 year before his first term was over, he announced he would not seek re-election to a second term. Torpey's term ended May 18 when he swore-in South Orange's second-youngest, and first female, Village President, Sheena Collum, whom he supported in the election, and had served with for two previous years on South Orange's governing body. Torpey was born in New York City, and raised first in Maplewood, then South Orange, and is an alumnus of Columbia High School (2005). Torpey completed his undergraduate degree in Political Science, American Government and Law at Hampshire College, while also serving as student government president. He also holds a Master of Public Administration in emergency management from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. Torpey founded is a managing partner of Veracity Media LLC, a social-impact consulting firm. Torpey also founded a nonpartisan initiative, Rethink Leadership, to help encourage young people to consider elected office and local government as a way to become more involved and active in their government and public policy issues. Torpey was named a 2013-2014 James Madison Fellow at the bi-partisan Millennial Action Project for his work in encouraging young people towards civics participation. Torpey also serves on the advisory board of the New Jersey chapter of the New Leaders Council and on Sustainable Jersey's Community Information and Citizen Engagement Initiative. Starting in the fall semester of 2014, Torpey was appointed adjunct faculty of governance and technology at Seton Hall University, co-teaching with Dr. Matt Hale, master of public administration students on topics of collaboration and technology innovation in government. Torpey’s philosophy of governance relies heavily on the use of technology, media and communications to increase interactivity, transparency and efficiency towards the ends of better government. He has written and lectured on these topics frequently prior to his election and since. While in office, Torpey primarily worked on a number of fiscal, economic development, public safety, transparency, community engagement and organizational development initiatives, in addition to petitioning utility companies for better preparedness efforts after Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy; along with several other New Jersey mayors, performing one of the first legal same-sex marriages in the state in 2013 (as well as being a vocal advocate on the issue); advocating for better open data standards, a tuition-credit program for volunteer first responders and updates to homelessness and veterans support programs. In addition to his official municipal responsibilities as Village President, Torpey served as a member and EMT of the South Orange Rescue Squad. Torpey also served as South Orange's municipal Office of Emergency Management Coordinator.",

In 2008 he was elected to the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly for the seat of Seberang Takir, defeating a People's Justice Party (PKR) candidate. The State's incoming Chief Minister Ahmad Said appointed him to the State's Executive Council—akin to a cabinet—with responsibility for education, higher education, science, technology and human resources. Ahmad Razif retained his assembly seat at the 2013 election. However, the Barisan Nasional state government almost lost its majority in the assembly, clinging to power with a slim 17–15 majority. In response, the coalition's national leader, and the Prime Minister, Najib Razak, pressured Ahmad Said to resign within a year. In May 2014, Ahmad Said stood down and Ahmad Razif was appointed as his replacement. He was sworn in to office by Mizan Zainal Abidin, the Sultan of Terengganu, on 13 May. Ahmad Razif's first task as Chief Minister was to navigate a political crisis when Ahmad Said and two other UMNO assemblymen resigned from UMNO immediately after his appointment, potentially plunging his government into minority status. Ahmad Said stated that he was dissatisfied that he had not been allowed to remain as Chief Minister until after the wedding of his daughter in May 2014. The three assemblymen returned to the party within days, after the intervention of Najib and other senior Barisan Nasional leaders. On 22 April 2016, his 'Datuk Seri' title had been revoked by the Sultan.",
