A teacher by profession, Knight was first elected as a New Democratic Party MP in a 1971 by-election and was re-elected in 1972. He represented the riding of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan until his defeat in the 1974 federal election by Liberal Ralph Goodale. Knight attempted to return to Parliament from the same constituency in 1979 but was defeated by Progressive Conservative Len Gustafson. Knight served as principal secretary to both federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent and Saskatchewan Premier Allan Blakeney in the 1970s. In the 1980s he was federal secretary of the New Democratic Party and its chief electoral strategist.
