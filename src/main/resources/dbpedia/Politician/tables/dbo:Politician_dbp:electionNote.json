According to his LinkedIn profile, Sorenson is currently a realtor with EXIT Realty North Star in Norwalk, IA. Sorenson is not listed as an agent on the EXIT website. A Republican, he served in the Iowa House of Representatives from 2009 to 2011, representing District 74 and then represented District 37 in the Iowa Senate. As of October 2013, Sorenson was a member of the Judiciary,Government Oversight, and State Government committees of the Iowa Senate. He was also the ranking member of both the Senate and Joint Oversight Committees and a member of the Advisory Council for Agricultural Education, the Family Development and Self-Sufficiency Council, and the Human Rights Board. Sorenson resigned from office October 2, 2013 after Iowa’s Senate Ethics committee found “probable cause” that Sorenson violated state ethics rules by taking payments from the Michele Bachmann (R MN) and Ron Paul (R TX) campaigns in the 2012 Republican Presidential primaries and that \"his denials of doing so constituted felonious misconduct in office.\"",
