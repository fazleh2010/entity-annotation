  "text" : "Sir Edmund Barton, GCMG, KC (18 January 1849 – 7 January 1920) was an Australian politician and judge. He served as the first Prime Minister of Australia from 1901 to 1903 and became a founding justice of the High Court of Australia. Barton first became an MP in 1879, in the Parliament of New South Wales. He contributed to the federation movement through the 1890s, eventually contesting the inaugural 1901 federal election as head of a caretaker Protectionist Party federal government, after the initial confusion of the Hopetoun Blunder. No party won a majority; however, he was able to form government with support from the Australian Labor Party, against the opposition Free Trade Party. Barton resigned as Prime Minister in 1903 to become a judge of the High Court of Australia, serving until his death in 1920.",

  "text" : "Albert Edgar Solomon (7 March 1876 – 5 October 1914) was an Australian politician. He was Premier of Tasmania from 14 June 1912 to 6 April 1914. Solomon graduated B.A. in 1895 and LL.B. in 1897 at the University of Tasmania, and subsequently qualified for the degrees of M.A. and LL.M. He was admitted to the bar in February 1898. He entered politics as one of the six MHAs for Bass in April 1909, and almost immediately became attorney-general and minister for education in the Elliott Lewis second and third ministries, taking the additional position of minister of mines in October 1909. When Lewis retired in June 1912 Solomon became premier, attorney-general and minister of education, but he had a bare majority of one and it required much tact and finesse to keep the ministry going until April 1914. Attention was given to education and considerable additions were made to the number of state and high schools. Never a robust man, Solomon felt the strain of office – his health broke down, and he died at Hobart aged 38 on 5 October 1914. He was survived by his wife and two sons. He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church and a temperance reformer.",
