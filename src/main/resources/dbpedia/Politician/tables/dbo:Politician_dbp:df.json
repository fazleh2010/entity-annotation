  "text" : "John Hutchyns Tyndall' (14 July 1934 – 19 July 2005) was a British National Socialist. As a prominent figure in British nationalism during the second half of the twentieth century, Tyndall was involved during the 1960s with neo-Nazi movements, most notably being the deputy leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement under Colin Jordan. However, he is best known for leading the National Front (NF) in the late 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Born in Devon, Tyndall undertook national service prior to reading the work of Adolf Hitler and involving himself in extreme-right politics. In the mid-1950s he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Growing frustrated with the LEL's approach, in 1957 he co-founded the National Labour Party (NLP) with John Bean. In 1960 the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Tyndall grew close to Jordan and together they embraced an overt Neo-Nazi approach to racial nationalism, establishing a paramilitary group called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement. In 1962 he was convicted and imprisoned for establishing a paramilitary organisation. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall then formed his Greater Britain Movement, another explicitly Neo-Nazi group, in 1964. In 1967 Tyndall joined the newly established National Front, which was then led by Chesterton. He took on the role of Vice Chairman and eventually assumed the position of Chairman in 1972. His leadership was however threatened by both a 'populist moderate' faction and a Strasserite faction. In 1974 he was deposed as Chairman and briefly expelled from the party the following year. On his return he resumed his position as Chairman, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980, forming his short-lived New National Front. In 1982 he established the new British National Party, which grew into the most prominent extreme-right group in the UK by the late 1980s. Electoral success however largely eluded the party. Tyndall's refusal to moderate any of the party's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of 'modernisers', who succeeded in ousting him in 1999, when he was replaced by Nick Griffin. Tyndall retained his affiliation with the BNP for the following few years prior to his death.",
