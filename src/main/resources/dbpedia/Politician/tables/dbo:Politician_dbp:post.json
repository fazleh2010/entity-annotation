Following his retirement from Royal Insurance, he became a private insurance consultant for a number of years. In the 1999 election, he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster as a Progressive Conservative and shortly afterwards became the New Brunswick Minister of Labour. In 2000, he became minister for the new Department of Training and Employment Development, a portfolio which encompassed much of his old labour portfolio as well as some social welfare programs and community colleges. McFarlane was defeated in the 2003 election and left the cabinet as a result. McFarlane lost his seat to Liberal Abel LeBlanc. McFarlane promptly returned to politics in 2004 when he was elected mayor of Saint John by defeating incumbent Shirley McAlary by a margin of over 25%. Ironically, one of McAlary's key backers was Abel LeBlanc. Mayor McFarlane faced severe and lasting criticism and allegations of corruption and incompetence for his role in granting Irving Oil tax concessions in 2005, concessions that have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.",

En l’an 249, alors qu’il est Inspecteur de la province de Yong et que Sima Yi veut extirper le pouvoir militaire des mains de Cao Shuang, Chen Tai, assisté de Xu Yun, est envoyé comme messager auprès de Cao Shuang. Lors de la première campagne militaire de Jiang Wei contre les Wei, Chen Tai est envoyé à la tête d’une armée de 50 000 soldats pour opposer l’armée des Shu. Il assiége les forts ennemis positionnés dans les montagnes Qu'et repousse Jiang Wei à la colline de la Tête de Bœuf, remportant ainsi une splendide victoire. Durant la seconde campagne militaire de Jiang Wei contre les Wei, il réussit à piéger les Qiang, alors allié des Shu, et parvient ainsi a défaire l’invasion. En l’an 255, il gagne le titre de Commandant des Forces Armées des provinces de Yong et de Liang et parvient ensuite, avec l’aide de Deng Ai, à défaire la troisième et quatrième campagne de Jiang Wei. Peu après, il est nommé Superviseur du Secrétariat des Wei, participe à la répression de la rébellion de Zhuge Dan et est ensuite nommé Ministre des Travaux. Enfin, en l’an 260, après que Sima Zhao a ordonné l’assassinat de Cao Mao, Chen Tai s’absente à un conseil des ministres convoqué par ce dernier, pleure et porte des robes funèbres en guise de deuil pour Cao Mao. Toutefois, il finit par répondre à l’appel et lorsque Sima Zhao lui demande comment punir les régicides, Chen Tai lui propose de mettre à mort Jia Chong. Sima Zhao rejette la proposition qu’il juge trop sévère et Chen Tai est tellement enragé qu’il s’effondre soudainement et meurt.",

  "text" : "Rick Doucet (born in Sussex, New Brunswick) is a New Brunswick businessman and politician. He currently represents the riding of Fundy-The Isles-Saint John West in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. Rick lives in St. George with his wife and two children, Nicole and Jonathan. Doucet has had a varied career working in the air industry both as a marketing and sales official with a commercial airline and later as a cargo pilot. He started his own series of businesses in 1989 eventually working simultaneously in the restaurant, photography and advertising industries. A Liberal, he was a member of the opposition shadow cabinet. He was critic for the Department of Energy from his first election in June 2003 until becoming critic for Fisheries & Aquaculture in February, 2005. Doucet received favourable media attention when, shortly following his appointment as Energy Critic, he toured the province to visit all of its power generation facilities at his own expense. He was re-elected in the 2006 election following which he joined the cabinet. One October 3, 2006 he was sworn in as Minister of Fisheries under the Shawn Graham government. He maintained this role throughout all of the four years the Liberals were in government. Despite the losses received by the Shawn Graham Liberals in the 2010 provincial election, Doucet retained his seat, beating out the Progressive Conservative candidate Sharon Tucker. Doucet would sit in Opposition from 2010 to 2014, with his riding remaining the only Liberal controlled riding in southwestern New Brunswick. During his time in Opposition, Doucet was critic, at various periods, of Energy, Transportation and Public Safety. As critic for Public Safety, Doucet was very vocal in his displeasure with the Government's reaction to the flooding of December 2010 and Hurricane Arthur in July 2014. In the 2014 election, Doucet's riding was affected by the 2013 electoral redistribution in New Brunswick. For this election, Doucet's principal challenger was incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA Jim Parrott. On September 22, 2014 Doucet was re-elected for a 4th consecutive time.",

She resigned her seat on council upon being elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1991 provincial election. A member of Frank McKenna's Liberal Party, she was immediately named to cabinet and became deputy premier in 1994. She served in a variety of roles in cabinet until the defeat of the Liberals in the 1999 election. She defeated PC candidate Robert N. Stairs to retain her seat in Bathurst, one of only 10 Liberals to survive what was their worst ever electoral defeat. In opposition she was a top critic and the media reported she had lost the vote in her caucus to become interim leader of her party by a margin of 4-3 following the resignation of Camille Thériault. Her most high-profile role in opposition was that of finance critic. She did not seek re-election to the legislature in 2003 but has remained active in her party. She was elected vice president of the New Brunswick Liberal Association on October 4, 2003 and re-elected on October 15, 2005. During the 2004 federal election, she was co-chair of the Liberal campaign in New Brunswick. She was the Liberal candidate for the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Acadie—Bathurst in the 2006 federal election, but finished second to Yvon Godin of the New Democratic Party. She served as co-chair of the successful Liberal campaign as it prepared for the 2006 provincial election. She succeeded Greg Byrne as president of the New Brunswick Liberal Party when he resigned after being appointed to the cabinet following the 2006 election and served the post until stepping down in the Fall of 2007.",

Prudent de parole, à la fois sévère et bienséant, il joignit Sun Quan sur la recommandation de Zhang Hong et fut affecté au poste d’Assistant du District de Kuaiji. Il s’illustra dans l’administration des terres sous sa juridiction en chassant les rebelles et en y amenant paix et stabilité, de même qu’il accueillit, avec Zhang Hong, plusieurs hommes de renom. Discret de nature, ses conseils furent toujours bien accueillis par Sun Quan, qui y porta une attention particulière. Ainsi, il fut écouté lorsqu’il recommanda à Sun Quan de pétitionner le trône afin de donner le titre de Protecteur Impériale de la province de Jing à Liu Bei, plutôt que de combattre ce dernier en s’affaiblissant face à Cao Cao. En l’an 212, alors que Liu Bei se trouva à l’ouest, dans la province de Yi, Gu Yong proposa d’attaquer la province de Jing afin de recouvrir ces terres longtemps convoités. En raison d'une menace d’invasion de Cao Cao, l’attaque n’eut cependant pas lieu. Souvent consulté avec Zhang Zhao sur les enjeux cruciaux, il conseilla à Sun Quan en l’an 217, de rétablir la paix avec Cao Cao. Une alliance se forgea donc et en l’an 221, lorsque Cao Cao offrit le titre de Roi des Wu à Sun Quan, Gu Yong s’y opposa, prétextant qu’il devrait plutôt se nommer lui-même Commandant en Chef. Toutefois, Sun Quan accepta le titre et Gu Yong fut nommé Préfet des Maîtres des Écrits et devint, en l’an 225, Premier Ministre des Wu avec autorité sur le secrétariat impérial. Plus tard, lorsque l’alliance se brisa, il recommanda Lu Xun pour contrer l’invasion mener par Cao Xiu en l’an 228. D’ailleurs, il fut reconnu pour son objectivité dans ses nominations de même que par son grand sens de la justice tout au long de son mandat. Grandement respecté, il tomba malade, puis mourut en l’an 243. Ses descendants continuèrent à occuper des rangs importants pendant plusieurs générations.",

  "text" : "La Presidencia de Ulisses S. Grant comenzó durante el turbulento período de reconstrucción después de la guerra civil americana. Grant fue elegido como el décimo octavo Presidente de los Estados Unidos en 1868 y fue re-elegido para el cargo en 1872, sirviendo desde el 4 de marzo de 1869 hasta el 4 de marzo de 1877. Grant era un republicano y sus principales seguidores fueron radicales y facciones leales. Los Estados Unidos estuvo en prospera paz con el mundo a lo largo de la época hasta el Pánico de 1873, una severa depresión nacional que dominó el segundo mandato de Grant. Grant reforzó los poderes de aplicación del poder Ejecutivo mediante la firma en ley del Departamento de justicia y la Oficina del Procurador general que se implementó para proteger los derechos civiles de los afroamericanos. Grant amplió la autoridad federal que protege los derechos civiles afroamericanos contra el terrorismo interno en el Sur. La presidencia de Grant representaba los valores de la guerra civil que incluyeron \"unión, libertad y igualdad.\" política de reconstrucción de Grant, sin embargo, fue cuestionado por las complejidades del uso del Ejército de Estados Unidos para imponer la democracia y la igualdad jurídica, independientemente de la resistencia de los demócratas en el Sur. Grant trabajo duro para asegurar el paso de la décimo quinta enmienda que dio a los negros el derecho al voto. Los notables esfuerzos de Grant como Presidente incluyeron los derechos civiles, la reforma del servicio civil y la política indígena. La política exterior de Grant en el marco de Hamilton Fish fue un éxito y la mejora de las relaciones anglo-americanas. Grant se opuso a la facción liberal del Partido Republicano, muchos de los fundadores del Partido Republicano, quienes denunciaron a Grant de violar el énfasis del partido en la lucha contra la corrupción. Los liberales insistieron en que la reconstrucción había sido un éxito, que la esclavitud y el secesionismo estaban muertos. Los liberales exigieron que las tropas del ejército fueran retiradas del Sur para que la vida política pueda reanudarse normalmente. Los liberales nombrados desde hace mucho tiempo por el portavoz republicano Horace Greeley en 1872, privando Concesión de la base intelectual del Partido Republicano. Greeley estaba en silencio con el apoyo de los demócratas, pero fue derrotado de manera decisiva por Grant. En lugar de crear un grupo de asesores políticos de confianza, Grant tuvo un exceso de confianza en la elección de su gabinete; se basó en gran medida de antiguos asociados del ejército que tenían una fina comprensión de la política y un débil sentido de la ética civil. Su reputación presidencial fue severamente dañada por los repetidos escándalos y fraudes. Después de haber luchado para hacerse un hombrea sí mismo, Grant fue sumamente fiel a sí mismo y a su familia, confiando al mismo tiempo de los asociados militares más cercanos lo que a su vez provocó la discordia entre los reformadores que él pensaba que estaban conspirando para derrocar a su gobierno. Grant desestimó a tres miembros del Gabinete sin previo aviso o explicación. Dos de sus secretarios del gabinete (Guerra y Marina), su secretario personal, y altos funcionarios que nombró al departamento de Hacienda se unieron a sindicatos federales de soborno o de evasión de impuestos. Las acusaciones de corrupción eran rampantes en el Departamento del Interior en 1874, hasta la concesión nombrado un reformador. Grant solía defender a los culpables, en lugar de a la integridad de la Administración pública, mientras que atacó a sus acusadores. La opinión pública de la clase media, un elemento clave en la base del Partido Republicano, se volvió hostil a Grant. Algunos estudiosos, sin embargo , sostienen que los cargos de corrupción fueron exagerados durante la administración de Grant, y que Grant implemento la reforma del servicio civil y el sistema de mitades. Grant jugó un papel importante en frustrar al Golden Ring en 1869 y en el enjuiciamiento del Whiskey Ring en 1875. Su Fiscal General Edwards Pierrepont y Director General de Correos John AJ Creswell hicieron reformas radicales en sus respetados departamentos, y varios del Gabinete de Grant iniciaron el servicio civile en sus propios departamentos. Después de una salida en falso con selecciones débiles, Grant nombró a sus principales reformadores del gabinete, incluyendo a Hamilton Fish, Benjamin Bristow, Alphonso Taft, y Amos T. Akerman. Fish, como Secretario de Estado, negoció el Tratado de Washington y tuvo éxito en mantener a Estados Unidos fuera de problemas con Gran Bretaña y España. Bristow, como Secretario de Hacienda, puso fin a la corrupción del Whiskey Ring en que los destiladores y los funcionarios corruptos hicieron millones de evasión de impuestos. Taft, un jurista brillante como fiscal general, negocio con éxito para el panel bipartidista para una solución pacífica de la controversia de la elección de 1876. Grant y el Procurador General Akerman hicieron cumplir la legislación de derechos civiles que protegía a los afroamericanos y destruyó el Ku Klux Klan. Grant animó a las negociaciones del Congreso pacíficos después de la controvertida elección de 1876; firmó la Ley de la Comisión Electoral de 1877; mientras que el Compromiso de 1877 terminó la Reconstrucción. Económicamente, Grant era un conservador que favoreció a una moneda fuerte basada en el oro, la política anti-inflacionaria que implicaba el pago de la gran deuda nacional con oro. Redujo el gasto gubernamental, disminuyó la fuerza de trabajo federal, y redujo la deuda nacional, mientras que los ingresos fiscales se incrementaron en el Departamento de Hacienda. Durante su segundo mandato, el Pánico de 1873, causado por la especulación desenfrenada del ferrocarril, sacudió las instituciones financieras de la nación; bancos quebraron, los precios cayeron, y aumento el desempleo. Antes del pánico se habían producido ocho años de gran crecimiento industrial después de la Guerra Civil que alimentaron esquemas lujosos de hacer dinero, codicia personal, y la corrupción nacional. La contracción de la oferta monetaria del presidente Grant agravó el pánico; la mayor depresión subsiguiente de EE.UU. que siguió duró cinco años causando un daño económico enorme para el país. El pánico aniquiló tanto la suerte de los negocios como la de la corrupción. La reconstrucción del Sur continuó lo que incluyó la intensificación de la violencia sobre el estado de los liberales y alianzas fracturadas de partidos, elecciones estatales. Con la finalización del ferrocarril transcontinental en 1869, Occidente estaba abierta al expansionismo que a veces fue desafiado por los hostiles nativos americanos. Grant implementó una política de paz innovadora, aunque no siempre con éxito, con los nativos americanos. Las hostilidades se llevaron a cabo con la Guerra de Modoc, la Guerra del Río Rojo, y la Gran Guerra Sioux que culminó con la famosa batalla de Little Bighorn, donde el teniente coronel George Armstrong Custer murió. En 1874, millones de búfalos eran sacrificados para hacer sitio a los colonos y ganaderos. Grant, que favoreció a los ganaderos el uso de la tierra para el ganado doméstico, rechazó la legislación que habría limitado la masacre de los bisontes. Después de que la fatal comisión de paz Modoc en 1873, la política americana nativa de Grant incorpora las estrategias militares favorecidos por William T. Sherman y Phil Sheridan. Grant dio apoyo legislativo al movimiento sufragista temprano. La corrupción fue rampante en el Departamento de Asuntos Indígenas bajo el Secretario del Interior Columbus Delano. Sin embargo, Grant y el secretario Delano tuvieron éxito en la creación del primer parque nacional de Estados Unidos, Yellowstone, y el San Carlos Apache Reserva India. La corrupción del Departamento del Interior fue limpiado por el Secretario de Grant, Zachariah Chandler en 1875. EL legado presidencial de Grant ha sufrió debido a su uso de mano dura del Ejército de estados Unidos para apuntalar sus aliados políticos en los estados del sur. Sin embargo, desde mediados de la década de 1990 su reputación presidencial ha mejorado como historiadores hacen hincapié en la aplicación de los derechos civiles afroamericanos, en la política de su paz y de los indios del sur.",
