  "text" : "Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd (8 September 1901 – 6 September 1966), also known as Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, was a South African Psychology and Philosophy scholar, Afrikaans newspaper editor-in-chief and Prime Minister of South Africa. He is regarded as the mastermind behind socially engineering and implementing the racial policies of apartheid, the system of legal racial classification and forced racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. Verwoerd rigidly enforced Apartheid policies through further introducing oppressive laws, which diminished the rights of ordinary individuals especially black South Africans. Verwoerd empowered the police, Secret Police and Army to extraordinary levels. During his time in office he ordered a secret all-out offensive against those opposed to apartheid policies and as a result tens of thousands people were arrested, jailed and or sent into exile. People were also tortured and killed (Sharpeville massacre) during his time in office. Verwoerd was a right wing authoritarian leader and Afrikaner nationalist. He was a strong advocate of the Afrikaner volk, language, culture and Christian religion. He held that white control over South Africa could only continue if the races lived apart. He survived an assassination attempt in 1960, succumbing to a subsequent one in 1966. Prior to entering politics, Verwoerd was regarded as a brilliant social science professor at Stellenbosch University. He completed his undergraduate studies with distinctions majoring in sociology, psychology and philosophy. Verwoerd continued his studies completing his master's (cum laude) and doctorate in social psychology and philosophy. As a result of his academic performance, Verwoerd received a post-doctoral scholarship from the University of Oxford, but turned it down and continued his research in the fields of sociology and philosophy at various German universities. Upon his return to South Africa, he was appointed professor of Applied Psychology at Stellenbosch University at the age of 26. He was then later appointed as head of the sociology department in 1933. Verwoerd was prime minister during the establishment of the Republic of South Africa in 1961, thereby fulfilling the Afrikaner dream of an independent republic for South Africans. During his tenure as prime minister, anti-apartheid movements such as the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) were banned, and the Rivonia Trial, which prosecuted ANC leaders, was held. His term ended with his assassination on 6 September 1966 by Dimitri Tsafendas. Many major roads, places and facilities in cities and towns of South Africa were named after Verwoerd; in post-apartheid South Africa, most of these references to the creator of apartheid have been renamed. Famous examples include H. F. Verwoerd Airport in Port Elizabeth, renamed Port Elizabeth Airport, the Verwoerd Dam in the Free State, now the Gariep Dam, H. F. Verwoerd Academic Hospital in Pretoria, now Steve Biko Hospital, and the town of Verwoerdburg, now Centurion.",
