Wahrscheinlich ist diese Person rein fiktiv. Unklar ist, auf wessen Betreiben und warum das nichtexistente Parteimitglied der Unafec auf die Liste der Minister des Kongo geriet. Kasongo Ilunga war einer von 60 Ministern und Vizeministern, die am 5. Februar 2007 vom Kabinett des Präsidenten Joseph Kabila nominiert wurden. Vorgeschlagen worden war er dem Premierminister Antoine Gizenga im Januar 2007 von der Parteiführung der Unafec, die ihn mitsamt Foto als Vizepräsidenten des Unafec-Ortsvereins Masina in Kongos Hauptstadt Kinshasa vorstellte und gemeinsam mit dem Parteichef Kisimba Ngoy als Ministerkandidaten ihrer Partei zur Auswahl stellte. Gizenga entschied sich für Ilunga Kasongo. Bereits am Tag nach der Regierungsbildung reichte Kasongo allerdings angeblich schriftlich bei seinem Parteichef seinen Rücktritt ein. Der Unafec-Provinzchef von Katanga, der angeblichen Heimatprovinz Ilungas, erklärte kurz darauf öffentlich, dass es kein Parteimitglied dieses Namens in Katanga gebe. Zwei Theorien kursieren, wie es zur Ernennung des offenkundig nicht-existenten Ilunga gekommen sein könnte. Nach der ersten Theorie hatte die Partei nicht mit der Ernennung Ilungas gerechnet und nur beabsichtigt, das Vorhandensein personeller Alternativen in der Partei vorzutäuschen. Die zweite Theorie bezieht sich darauf, dass der Unafec-Parteichef als Nachfolger Kasongo Ilungas einen „Pierre Ilunga“ vorschlug. Pierre Ilunga jedoch ist ein politisch diskreditierter ehemaliger Justizminister der früheren Kriegsherr-Regierung des Kongo, der auf diese verwickelte Weise u. U. in die Regierung kommen sollte. Eine Klarstellung des Regierungssprechers Godefroid Mayombo, dass Kasongo Ilunga mitnichten eine fiktive Person sei, führte dazu, dass sich innerhalb weniger Tage drei Personen mit dem im Kongo recht häufigen Namen Kasongo Ilunga meldeten und den Posten des Ministers beanspruchten. Alle drei wurden jedoch vom Unafec-Parteichef als Betrüger bloßgestellt.",

He represented the old districts 45, 46, and 65, which changed through the years due to legislative redistricting, and included portions of the city of Saint Paul in Ramsey County. Born in Saint Paul, Coleman served as a Signalman 2nd Class in the United States Navy during World War II. He entered politics as a volunteer for the 1948 congressional campaign of Eugene McCarthy, then a professor at the College of St. Thomas (now the University of St. Thomas), where Coleman was a student. He was later Minnesota chair for the 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon Johnson. While in the Senate, Coleman served as an assistant minority leader from 1967 to 1970, as minority leader during the 1971–1972 biennium, and as the first Democrat in 114 years to become majority leader—a position he held from 1973 until leaving the Senate in 1981. The Democrats have held the majority in that chamber of the Minnesota Legislature until January, 2011. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the DFL Party's endorsement for governor in 1970, and for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Coleman was a founder and partner of the advertising agency Coleman-Goff Advertising, later known as Coleman and Christison. He was the father of Chris Coleman, the current mayor of St. Paul, of Minnesota journalist Nick Coleman, and of the Acquisitions Librarian at the Minnesota Historical Society Library, Patrick K. Coleman. Prior to his career in advertising, he was a high school teacher for two years in the rural town of Tyler, MN. Coleman died of leukemia on March 5, 1981. His body lay in state in the Minnesota State Capitol before burial in Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis.",

Following the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election, in which Yamamoto endorsed George Abbott, the new Premier, Christy Clark, promoted Yamamoto to Minister of Advanced Education. Yamamoto has introduced one piece of legislation, the Advanced Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2011, which sought to implement several measures, including expanding the Personal Education Number system which tracks students in the BC educational system to also include private educational institutions, specifying that board members of colleges and universities are to act in the best interests of the institution, and updating the Architectural Institute of BC's dispute resolution process. The bill was introduced on November 3, 2011, but was not adopted before the winter break. Prior to her election to the legislature, Yamamoto owned and operated a business that started as a specialty shop for laser printing but evolved to focus on design and had created props for the television and film industry.

She served as Member of the European Parliament for Tyne South and Wear and Tyne and Wear successively from 1979 to 1989, and entered the House of Commons in the 1987 election as Member of Parliament for Gateshead East. After boundary changes for the 1997 general election, she represented the new Gateshead East and Washington West constituency from 1997 until she stepped down at the 2005 general election and was replaced by Sharon Hodgson. Quin served as prisons minister, Minister for Europe, and as a junior agriculture minister. She asked to retire as a minister in 2001 to concentrate on her constituency interests. She had intended to stand for membership of a North East Regional Assembly on her retirement from Westminster, but the proposed body was rejected by a margin of 4–1 in a referendum in November 2004. In April 2006, it was announced that Quin had been nominated for a life peerage by the Labour Party. On 30 May, she was created Baroness Quin, of Gateshead in the County of Tyne and Wear. In November 2007, she was appointed Chair of the Franco-British Council (British Section). She was appointed a shadow Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister by Harriet Harman in May 2010, and was retained in that role by Ed Miliband after his election as Leader of the Labour Party. She stood down from this position in July 2011. Quin is the grand-niece of Labour Party politician Joshua Ritson (1874–1955).",

  "text" : "Joy K. MacPhail (born March 6, 1952) is a former Canadian politician in British Columbia. A longtime member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party, she served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1991 to 2005 and as a Minister of the Crown from 1993–1999, and 2000-2001. MacPhail was born in Hamilton, Ontario, but has lived in Vancouver for almost three decades. She studied economics at the University of Western Ontario, and later earned a degree in labour studies at the London School of Economics. She has one son. MacPhail was first elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1991 as the MLA for Vancouver-Hastings, and served in the cabinets of three NDP premiers. Under Premier Mike Harcourt, she served as Minister of Social Services from 1993 to 1996. Under Premier Glen Clark she served a short stint as Minister of Social Services, then as Minister of Health from 1996 to 1998. MacPhail's final cabinet position in the Clark government was as Minister of Finance from 1998 to 1999, when she quit the Clark government at a time when it was suffering from increasing dissent and scandal. When Clark eventually quit the NDP leadership, MacPhail ran for NDP leader, but did not attract significant legislative caucus support. She withdrew when it became obvious that Ujjal Dosanjh had an insurmountable lead. Under Dosanjh, she was the Deputy Premier and served as Minister of Labour and later, Minister of Education. The NDP suffered a massive electoral blow in the May 16, 2001 provincial election, winning only two seats—those of MacPhail and Environment Minister Jenny Kwan. MacPhail only held onto her seat by 409 votes. Exactly one month after the election, MacPhail was appointed as the party's interim leader. She was a harsh critic of the new BC Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell. Although the NDP was the only other party in the legislature, it was four seats short of official party status. Despite this, Assembly Speaker Claude Richmond ensured that the NDP was resourced as an opposition and she was recognized by the Speaker as the Leader of the Opposition. MacPhail stepped down as leader in 2003 and was succeeded by Carole James. She remained as parliamentary leader of the NDP until her retirement from politics after the 2005 election. Following her departure from politics, MacPhail married film and television producer James Shavick, and is currently a partner in his production firm Shavick Entertainment. She is a member of the board of OutTV, a Canadian cable television station owned by Shavick Entertainment, and focused on the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. She has also appeared as a member of political panels on As It Happens on CBC Radio.",

Lloyd was the Liberal Party candidate for the safe Labor seat of Peats at the 1984 New South Wales State election, gathering 33.40% of the vote. His lobbying work prior to entering politics included collecting 60,000 signatures which resulted in the re-opening of the Cheero Point section of the Pacific Highway, which had been closed for several years following landslides. Lloyd was Chief Government Whip from 2001 to 2004 before his appointment as Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in July 2004. He was defeated in the 2007 election by Belinda Neal.",

Polk appointed Lane as the first Governor of Oregon Territory. When Oregon was admitted as a state in 1859, Lane was elected one of Oregon's first two U.S. Senators. In 1860, Lane was nominated for Vice President of the pro-slavery Southern wing of the Democratic Party, as John C. Breckinridge's running mate. Lane's pro-slavery views and sympathy for the Confederate States of America in the Civil War effectively ended his political career in Oregon. A son was later elected U.S. Representative and a grandson U.S. Senator, making Lane the patriarch of one of the state's most prominent political families.",

She first entered politics in 1997 when she was elected to Nepean city council. With the creation of the new amalgamated city of Ottawa in 2000, Harder ran against regional councillor Molly McGoldrick-Larsen. While the race was expected to be close, Harder ended up winning by several thousand votes. She was reelected in the 2003 Ottawa election, by defeating newcomer John R. Palmer. One of her first efforts on city council was the successful campaign to replace the new coat of arms with that of the old city of Ottawa. She also led a campaign to have filters installed on computers in the public libraries that would keep users from accessing pornography. In the November 2006 municipal elections, Harder retained her position as councillor with 75% of the vote in Barrhaven Ward. Harder was criticized for the appearance of a conflict of interest for having accepted a free corporate box seat at the 2007 Stanley Cup NHL hockey playoff game (Senators v.s. Anaheim Ducks) at Scotiabank Place from Waste Management Services—a company that the City does business with. She was accused of conflict of interest again in 2008 for allegedly endorsing a waste management company, Plasco, and accepting money in the form of a paid trip Harder is heavily active in Conservative politics and in the past mused about running federally in her riding.

These allegations became public after West became a target of a sting operation conducted by his hometown newspaper, the Spokesman Review. Some journalists and academics criticized the paper for what they saw as a form of entrapment. West admitted engaging in homosexual behavior with adults, despite an earlier record of supporting \"anti-gay\" legislation. Though never charged, he was removed from office by recall in 2005. The Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually closed its investigation and took no action for lack of evidence.",

A special prosecutor was appointed to look into a land deal that he was alleged to have benefited from.

Betts since returned to work in good heath having only suffered severe indigestion. On December 7, 2005, he was named deputy speaker replacing Trevor Holder who had been elevated to the cabinet.

Hartley, a resident of Waterbury, represents the western half of the city as well as its southern suburbs of Naugatuck and Prospect in the Connecticut Senate. Hartley was born in Waterbury and graduated from Elms College and received a M.A. from Trinity College. Prior to being elected to the Connecticut Senate, Hartley served as a Connecticut state representative representing the 73rd District from 1984 to 2000. Hartley's predecessor as a state representative was future Governor John G. Rowland. Perhaps as a result, Hartley is generally considered among the more conservative and bipartisan members of the Democratic caucus. In 2007 she was believed to be the sole holdout from the strategy of Senate President Donald E. Williams, Jr. to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of a Democratic state bonding package. Rell had vetoed the package claiming it put the state too far into debt. Hartley opposed a billion dollar commitment to the Connecticut State University system and has been threatened with retribution from Democratic party leadership. On October 30 an agreement was reached between the Rell Administration, legislative Democratic leaders and Senator Hartley to resolve the bonding stalemate. The final bonding package was reduced by $400 million from the level vetoed by Rell and increased oversight was placed on funds for the Connecticut State University system. The Courant later reported that pressure was placed on fellow senators against Hartley by Senator Thomas Gaffey, who had an undisclosed intimate relationship with the lobbyist for the university system. In December 2008, Hartley was removed as the Chairman of the Higher Education Committee because of her independence and willingness to stand up to the Democratic leadership who was shielding Gaffey. In 2008, Hartley was one of three Democrats who supported Governor M. Jodi Rell's proposal for a Three Strikes Law against career violent criminals. In 2009, Hartley was the only Democrat in the State Senate that did not vote to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of the Healthcare Partnership bill, thereby preventing the bill from becoming law. In 2011, Hartley and Paul Doyle were the only two Democrats to vote against transgender rights legislation.",

Williams was born on 18 August 1948 in Perth, where he spent the first four years of his life. He spent his next three years in Melbourne before moving to Broken Hill in 1955. He has lived there ever since. He studied economics, accounting and financial management externally through the University of New England. At the 2007 New South Wales state election, Williams won the seat of Murray-Darling. His candidacy was boosted by the redistribution prior to the election, which turned the seat from marginal Labor to marginal National. At the election, he defeated incumbent Labor MP Peter Black on a swing of nearly nine percent, turning Murray-Darling into a safe National seat at one stroke. He was handily reelected in 2011, increasing his majority to 17 percent. In July 2014 it was revealed that Williams had verbally attacked then Coalition cabinet minister Robyn Parker with a sexist slur in April 2014, at a meeting in Parliament House during his bid for pre-selection for the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was endorsed as a National Party candidate for the Legislative Council, although in the unwinnable fourth position on the ticket, and was defeated accordingly at the election. Williams is married to Helen. He has two children and two grandchildren.",

On March 26, 2012, van Dongen announced he was leaving the BC Liberal Party to sit as the only BC Conservative Party MLA in the legislature. He competed in the May 2013 election running as an independent and lost to Darryl Plecas. On April 24, 2009, van Dongen announced that the BC Office of the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles, a department for which he is responsible in the Legislature, had suspended his driver's licence for a period of four months. In an interview with CBC Radio van Dongen said the suspension was a result of his being cited twice in one year for driving in excess of 41 km/h above the posted speed limit. Van Dongen featured prominently in anti-speeding advertising campaigns for the provincial government in recent years. Three days later, van Dongen resigned as Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor-General. After the 2009 provincial election, van Dongen was appointed Party Whip, and continued in his roles as Member of the Parliamentary Committee on Finance and Government Services, and Chair of the Caucus Committee on Government Restructuring. In 2010, he was appointed as the Chair of the Parliamentary Committee to Appoint a Chief Electoral Officer for BC. On March 26, 2012, van Dongen crossed the floor of the Legislative Assembly to become the first BC Conservative Party Member of the Legislative Assembly. On September 22, 2012, he then announced he was resigning from the BC Conservative Party to sit as an independent.",

Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

In 1931, he built a public bathhouse at the corner of Bagg and St. Lawrence, which still stands today as the Schubert Bath (official French name: Bain Schubert). He served for three months as the city's acting mayor, commencing August 29, 1927, under mayor Médéric Martin. (Despite the title \"acting mayor\", however, he was never the city's official leader; in modern terms, his role would be more accurately understood as that of a deputy mayor or a mayor pro tem.)

In 1993 he was elected as a Reform Member of Parliament in the Saskatchewan riding of Kindersley—Lloydminster. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 until 1995. Due to redistribution his hometown was located in the new constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar for the 1997 election. He ran against fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party for the new seat and lost. Hermanson sought the leadership of the newly founded Saskatchewan Party in 1998, and defeated Rod Gantefoer and Yogi Huyghebaert in a one member one vote election. He was elected to the provincial legislature for Rosetown-Biggar in the 1999 provincial election and became Leader of the Opposition. While the party reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party to a minority government, it was almost nonexistent outside the rural areas; it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party five seats short of making Hermanson Premier. Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in 2003. However, he came up short again in the provincial election that November, in which the NDP actually won a bare majority. While the Saskatchewan Party scored a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election and was subsequently succeeded by Brad Wall. Hermanson remained the MLA for the new constituency of Rosetown-Elrose. On Friday, June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature.",

A member of the Reform Party, Harper was the only MP from that party ever elected anywhere east of Manitoba. He defeated Liberal candidate Janice Laking, the incumbent mayor of Barrie, by a margin of 123 votes. Ironically, political analysts largely credited his victory over Laking to her popularity rather than his, suggesting that many voters in Barrie switched their votes only because they didn't want Laking to step down as mayor. Harper did not stand for reelection in the 1997 election. Before being elected to Parliament, Harper was a businessman in Barrie.",

In dieser Zeit führte sie zum Beispiel das Wort „Ikiaqqivik“ (wörtlich „Reisen durch Schichten“) als Inuktitutwort für „Internet“ ein, einen Begriff, der das traditionelle Reisen von Schamanen durch Zeit und Raum zur Beantwortung spiritueller und materieller Fragen umschreibt. Anschließend betätigte sie sich als Inuktitut-Lehrerin am Pirurvik Centre in Iqaluit, einer Beratungsgesellschaft für Inuit-Kultur. 2006 eröffnete sie in Iqaluit einen Store für Inuit-Kunst und -Kunsthandwerk, den sie „Malikkaat“ nannte (ein Inuktitut-Wort für das Ausrichten von Blüten nach der Sonne). Sie hatte außerdem folgende Positionen inne: Koordinatorin eines Inuktitut-Lehrbuchprogramms des „Baffin Divisional Education Council“, Präsidentin der Handelskammer der Baffin-Region und Vorsitzende der Nunavut-Film-Entwicklungsgesellschaft. 2007 übernahm sie erneut die Aufgabe einer Sprachenbeauftragten für Nunavut. Bei der Territorial-Wahl am 27. Oktober 2008 wurde sie für den Wahlbezirk Iqaluit-Ost erstmals in die Abgeordnetenkammer (Legislative Assembly) von Nunavut gewählt und ist das einzige weibliche Mitglied dieses Parlaments. Bei der Wahl des Premiers von Nunavut am 14. November 2008 im Nunavut-Führungsforum erhielt sie vor dem bisherigen Amtsinhaber Paul Okalik und dem Mitbewerber Tagak Curley die meisten Stimmen und war dadurch die einzige Frau (und fünfte Frau überhaupt) unter den Premierministern kanadischer Provinzen und Territorien.

He was the ninth and youngest son of the reverent. He fought in the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s, and was a Major in the Territorial Army. On 28 April 1868, Hamlin married Sarah Grace Barriball, the daughter of Charles Barriball of Waiuku, at his father's house near Waiuku (Barriball Road in Waiuku commemorates the location of the family's land). Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Remuera on 4 June 1900. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and seven daughters.",

In 1868, he killed Confederate colonel Henry Ashby in a notorious shootout in downtown Knoxville. Camp first rose to prominence as U.S. District Attorney for East Tennessee, serving from 1869 until 1871. During the late 1860s, he organized the Coal Creek Coal Company, which in subsequent decades grew to become one of the major coal producing companies in the region.

Born in 1863 in an area later incorporated into the Canadian province of Ontario, Day completed his education, and took up a job as a stagecoach driver. Soon after, he would find employment at the Massey-Harris company, an agricultural equipment manufacturer. During this time, Day first surveyed the land that he would eventually settle later on in his life. After briefly working as a loan company, Day moved to the west, after having aspirations of doing so since his youth. As the Canadian Pacific Railway gained entitlement to a portion of land in the prairies, Day became interested in purchasing a large portion, and did so in 1904. He then completed plans for what would later become the town that bears his name, Daysland, in present-day Flagstaff County, Alberta. Daysland was formed in 1905, when the railway line to the area was completed. Soon after, a large colonial-style house was built as a home for Day and his wife. Fitted with the latest appliances and technology at the time, it soon became the centre of the town, serving as an ice rink and tennis court, and hosting events, including auctions. After the opening of a post office in 1907, Daysland was officially incorporated as a town, with Day elected its first mayor. He would continue to serve in the capacity until his resignation in 1910. Two years later, Day moved to Edmonton, where he served as a major in the Army Reserve until his death from a long illness in 1919.",

Together they produced Canada's first text on mining law, The Laws of Mines in Canada. It was an impressive comparative law study that was reviewed in 12 Harvard Law Review (1898-9). After leaving the partnership he published The Law of Elections in Canada in 1905, evidencing his new interest in Canadian politics. He was a member of the Toronto Public School Board and Toronto Library Board for 10 years before running unsuccessfully for Mayor of Toronto in 1904. He served as Provincial Secretary and Registrar from 1916 to 1919. He died in 1929.",

In September 2009, Verge spoke out against his own government's cutbacks to health care in his district. Premier Danny Williams dismissed Verge's comments, saying that \"he didn't understand that that's what it meant\", and that, \"for what it's worth, he's entitled to his opinion.\" Verge was later booed at a rally against the cuts after he reversed himself and sided with the government, although he stated he also supported the people of his district.On October 7, Premier Williams appointed a new Minister of Health and Community Services.Joined by the new minister in Lewisporte on October 14, Verge stated, \"Government is looking harder and digging deeper to try and find a solution to the problem. ...Hopefully at the end of the day we will be able to deliver all the services that the people want coming out of Lewisporte.\"The government subsequently reversed its decision to remove laboratory and X-ray services from Lewisporte, as Verge reported in his year-end interview, saying, \"It was an issue that caused me to have a greater appreciation for the people throughout our district and to also have a greater respect for our government - a government that proved it was willing to listen to the people and if necessary, to change its mind.\"",

Marie, Ontario, and is a member of the Michipicoten First Nation. He was a medical assistant in the Canadian Forces during the 1991 Gulf War. He later obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, as well as a Bachelor of Arts degree in Native Studies and a Master of Arts degree in Humanities from Laurentian University. He is now a teacher, artist and cultural consultant in Sudbury, and was seeking a PhD in human studies from Laurentian at the time of the 2008 election. Morin has served on the board of the Sudbury Arts Council, was a founder of the White Mountain Academy of the Arts, and is a strong advocate for local artists. In 2003, he proposed a community arts centre for downtown Sudbury. His own works have been displayed nationally. He first ran as the party's candidate in Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing in the 2006 election, and subsequently ran in Sudbury in the 2008 election and the 2011 election. In both 2006 and 2008, Morin was the party's most successful candidate in number of votes received; in 2011, he was the party's only candidate. Morin was the Eastern Regional Representative for Aboriginal Students with the Canadian Federation of Students while attending university, and became politically active as president of the Young Liberals Association at Cambrian College. He later joined the FPNP, and was nominated as the party's first candidate for public office on December 28, 2005. In 2008, he argued that he was campaigning on a platform of aboriginal values, and fighting for the inclusion of aboriginal people in the political process. During the 2008 election campaign, he was excluded from an all-candidates debate on CIGM, and all four of the major party candidates — Liberal Diane Marleau, Conservative Gerry Labelle, New Democrat Glenn Thibeault and Green Gordon Harris — chose to boycott the debate rather than participate without Morin present. Although he received few votes, he said after the election that he accomplished what he set out to achieve. In 2006, Morin took part in a protest in support of a road blockade by the members of the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Brant. He later took part in a protest against the Canadian Pacific Spirit Train during the 2008 election. The Spirit Train was intended to raise support for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver; many protesters argued that the games were taking place on stolen native land.",

  "text" : "Wannarat Channukul (Thai: วรรณรัตน์ ชาญนุกูล) (Nakhon Ratchasima, 8 maart 1949) is een Thaise arts en politicus. Hij is de leider van de politieke partij Chart Pattana Puea Pandin en Minister van Industrie in het kabinet van Abhisit Vejjajiva. Channukul studeerde geneeskunde aan de Chulalongkorn-universiteit, gegradueerd met een M.D., en rechten aan de Open Universiteit van Sukhothai, gegradueerd met een LL.B. Na zijn opleiding werkte hij als een dokter. In 1992 werd Wannarat geselecteerd voor een plaats in het parlement, waar hij de provincie Nakhon Ratchasima moest vertegenwoordigen. Vijf maal werd hij herkozen. Van 2004 tot 2007 hoorde hij bij de Thai Rak Thai, de partij van premier Thaksin Shinawatra, tot het moment dat de regering door het leger ten val werd gebracht en het constitutioneel hof de partij verbood. Channukul werd later Minister van Industrie in de regering van Somchai Wongsawat voor drie maanden, tot de kleine partijen de coalitie verbroken en Vejjajiva verkozen tot nieuwe premier. Toch bleef Channukul in de regering zitten. Voor de algemene verkiezingen van 2011 voegde Channuluk's partij (in het Engels de United National Development Party) zich samen met de Puea Pandin partij, om samen de nieuwe Chart Pattana Puea Pandin partij te vormen. Na de verkiezing van 2011 leidde Channukul de partij naar de coalitie samen met de succesvolle Pheu Thai partij en werd (wederom) gekozen tot Minister van Industrie op 9 augustus 2011, in het kabinet van premier Yingluck Shinawatra. Channuluk verkreeg zowel de Orde van de Witte Olifant als de Orde van de Kroon van Siam.",

  "text" : "Sir Vernon Haddon Treatt KBE, MM, QC (15 May 1897 – 20 September 1984) was an Australian lawyer, soldier, Rhodes Scholar and politician. Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984.",

He resigned as leader after his second election defeat, and was replaced by his former deputy, Jeff Seeney. However, after only 16 months as leader and facing poor opinion polling against Seeney, Springborg replaced him. Following this defeat Springborg played a leading role in the creation of the Liberal National Party (LNP), becoming the party's first leader but resigning after he led it to defeat at the 2009 Queensland election. John-Paul Langbroek was elected as his successor, with Springborg elected as Deputy Leader. Following a move by the LNP organisation to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney respectively. The Newman-led LNP overwhelmingly won the 2012 election and Springborg became Minister for Health in the Newman Cabinet. After the 2015 election, Newman lost his electorate of Ashgrove and Springborg was once again elected leader of the LNP, with Langbroek serving as his deputy as the LNP returned to opposition after one term in office. On 6 May 2016, Springborg lost the leadership of the LNP to Tim Nicholls.",

For this, together with his extensive ownership of land and property, he is known as the \"King of the New Territories\" (新界王) or the \"Land Emperor of the New Territories\" (新界土皇帝).

The conviction came at the same time as James Arvaluk was charged with assault against his girl friend. He pleaded guilty and resigned. The two scandals rocked the new government, and caused a substantial drop in positive public opinion. The resignation led to the first by-election in Nunavut history. Barnabas ran in the December 2000 by-election but was defeated by Rebekah Williams. He ran again in the 2004 Nunavut election in a hotly contested race and defeated Williams by doubling her vote count.",

He was appointed Director of the Higher Education office in October 2011 by Governor of Minnesota Mark Dayton. Pogemiller is known for his outspoken, assertive leadership style and his strategic thinking. Reporter Tom Scheck of Minnesota Public Radio called him \"a brilliant and combative political tactician who often speaks his mind\".

Born in Rio de Janeiro, Lacerda was the son of a family of politicians from Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro state. When he was a law student, Lacerda became sympathetic to left-wing ideas, but by the 1940s, he had transformed into a staunch anticommunist and conservative. He started his journalism career at Diário de Notícias (English: News Daily) in 1929. In 1949 he founded the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa (English: Press Tribune). Starting his political career in 1947, Lacerda was elected to the legislative chamber (city council) of the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1950, he was elected a National Democratic Union representative for the state of Rio in the Chamber of Deputies. He became well known for his uncompromising opposition of the government of President Getúlio Vargas and even demanded the overthrow of Vargas. He survived an assassination attempt in August 1954, which became known as the crime of Rua Tonelero. It is widely believed by historians to have been made by men acting under the orders of Gregório Fortunato, O Anjo Negro (Portuguese for \"The Black Angel\"), a black man, who was the head of Vargas' personal bodyguards. Brazilian Air Force Major Rubens Vaz was killed in the attempt, and Lacerda was slightly injured. That sparked a political crisis that culminated with the suicide of Vargas. Lacerda was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies later in 1954, with more votes than any other candidate. He also opposed the government of President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira. Lacerda was elected governor of Guanabara State, comprising Rio, in 1960. His administration was praised for his efforts to solve some chronic problems of Rio such as water services, public transportation and housing. An opinionated and controversial politician, Lacerda was involved in the crisis of the resignation of President Jânio Quadros in 1961 and conspired against the presidency of João Goulart. Hoping to be elected president in the 1965 elections, Lacerda initially supported the military coup d'état of 1964 and was nominated the UDN candidate. Since the military was not willing to give up power, the 1965 elections were cancelled, and Lacerda began to oppose the regime. In 1968, his efforts to restore democracy in Brazil made him ally with his old enemies, Kubitschek and Goulart, and Lacerda was arrested for a brief period and stripped of his right to run for political office for ten years. Then, he retired from politics and resumed his journalism and publishing career. In 1977, he died suddenly in Rio de Janeiro.",

  "text" : "Chris Korwin-Kuczynski (born 1953) is a former Canadian municipal politician. He served as a councillor in Toronto from 1981 to 2003, and was the city's deputy mayor for a time. He was born in Toronto, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from York University. He has been a director of the Polish-Canadian Congress, and has served as a special assistant to the federal Minister of State for Multiculturalism. He ran unsuccessfully for city council in 1980 as Chris Korwin but was successful on his second attempt, in a 1981 by-election. In 1992, Korwin-Kuczynski successfully urged that the music group Barenaked Ladies be banned from performing a concert in Nathan Phillips Square because he believed their name objectified women (Toronto Star, 20 July 2005). This decision was widely ridiculed, and gave considerable publicity to the then-obscure band. Korwin-Kuczynski was a member of the council's right-wing, and was a frequent ally of fellow councillor Tom Jakobek (Toronto Star, 29 November 1994). Kyle Rae has suggested that Korwin-Kuczynski became isolated on council when Jakobek left in 2000 (Globe and Mail, 16 September 2003). In 1993, Korwin-Kuczynski was removed as chair of the Toronto Board of Health after criticizing a strongly worded AIDS prevention pamphlet published by the AIDS Committee of Toronto (Toronto Star, 23 January 1993). He had suggested that the Committee, which received significant support from Toronto's gay community, be denied city funding if it continued publishing such materials (Globe and Mail, 25 January 1995). Referring to his dismissal after the vote, he commented, \"[t]he only real issue I think this all stems from is AIDS, the whole issue surrounding the gay issue\" (Toronto Star, 22 January 1993). Kyle Rae, who is openly gay, has said that Korwin-Kuczynski was anti-gay during the early 1990s but later changed his views. In 2003, Rae was quoted as saying, \"He's now generally supportive of these issues, but that didn't come easily.\" He opposed a 1996 municipal bill that banned smoking in restaurants and bars, and requested that provincial Premier Mike Harris veto the measure (Montreal Gazette, 8 July 1996). Korwin-Kuczynski considered running for the Liberal nomination in Parkdale—High Park in the 1997 federal election, but ultimately declined (Toronto Star, 16 February 1997). He retired from the council in 2003, amid rumours that he would move into consulting work (Toronto Star, 24 December 2003). He endorsed Dennis Mills's bid for re-election in the 2004 federal election, and a newspaper report from the period suggest that he was considering running as a Liberal candidate in the next federal election (Globe and Mail, 22 December 2003). On September 27, 2006, he filed papers to run in the Toronto municipal election, 2006 in Ward 14. However the next day he withdrew his nomination. This allowed him to retain a fundraising surplus of $21,742 leftover from his last campaign. If he hadn't done this the money would have flowed into the city coffers. Korwin-Kuczynski is a former honorary Captain of the Canadian Navy, and once served as a Director on the board of the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto. His nickname is K-K.",

Laws was a weekly commentator on the television show The Filter with Fred Roggin from August 2009 until 2013 when the show went off the air. One of her episodes was nominated for an Emmy. Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet.",

Boyce grew up in Elm Creek, Manitoba, was educated at the University of Manitoba, and served as a signalman in the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1945. He later served as a school councillor at St. John's Technical High School. He supported Sidney Green for the leadership of the provincial NDP in 1968 and 1969. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Jim Cowan by almost 1,000 votes in the riding of Winnipeg Centre under the slogan Bud Boyce, your choice. He was not appointed to cabinet in the legislative term which followed, although he served as Deputy Speaker for a few months in 1971. In the 1973, he was re-elected by an increased majority over Tory candidate Robert Wilson. On June 26, 1974, Boyce entered cabinet as the Minister responsible for Corrections and Rehabilitations. He held this position until the Schreyer government was defeated in the 1977 election. Boyce was re-elected in the 1977 election, defeating Tory candidate Philip S. Lee with a reduced majority. In 1979, he supported Sidney Green's unsuccessful bid to become interim leader of the provincial NDP. On March 3, 1981, Boyce announced that he was joining Green's new Progressive Party of Manitoba, along with fellow New Democratic MLA Ben Hanuschak. He ran for re-election in the redistributed riding of Fort Rouge in the 1981 election, but fared poorly, receiving only 243 votes. After being defeated, Boyce worked as a consultant. He died at home in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1984, before the next election was held.",

  "text" : "Brenda Kay Chamberlain, PC (born April 9, 1952 in Toronto, Ontario) was a member of the Canadian House of Commons, representing the riding of Guelph for the Liberal Party from 1993 until her resignation as of April, 2008. Chamberlain was a home daycare owner and operator from 1979 to 1983, and served as the administrative assistant in a family-owned business from 1984 to 1987. She also served as Executive Director of the Wellington County Literacy Council from 1989 to 1993, and of the Guelph-Wellington Career Educational Council from 1992 to 1993. During this time she also served on the Wellington County Board of Education (1985–1993). Chamberlain sought the federal Liberal nomination in Guelph-Wellington in 1992. Chamberlain's main challenger for the nomination was to be former Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Maine, who represented Guelph in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979. Maine dropped out of the race after the riding's nomination meeting was scheduled for an early date, arguing that this favoured Chamberlain. Chamberlain went on to win the Liberal nomination by acclamation. Maine later decided to run as an independent candidate against Chamberlain in the 1993 federal election. Chamberlain was elected handily as the Liberals took all but one of Ontario's 101 seats—the closest any party has come to sweeping the country's biggest province at the federal level. Chamberlain was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1997 and 2000. For many years, she was known as a strong supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party. Chamberlain won another easy victory in the election of 2004, defeating her Conservative opponent by nearly 10,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Guelph. Chamberlain was elected a fifth time in the election of 2006, in which the Conservative Party won a national minority government. She was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and was a vocal opponent of her own party's plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Chamberlain also voted against her party's same-sex marriage bill in 2005. She was also involved in legislation which forced Bell Canada to revise its 411 billing policy. Chamberlain served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour from 1997 to 1999, and was parliamentary secretary to the president of the Queen's Privy Council, with special emphasis on public service reform and Métis and Non-Status Indians, from December 2003 to July 2004. Although opposition spread rumours that she was about to retire she stood for re-election in 2006 and won handily. Just over two years later, on March 7, 2008, Chamberlain announced her resignation from the House of Commons effective April 7. She did not provide a reason for her resignation. During that election and thereafter the Guelph Mercury subjected Chamberlain to increasing degrees of criticism. Hansard will show that Chamberlain's last official votes occurred during the finals of weeks of February 2008. Subsequently, in a 2008 by-election Liberal candidate Frank Valeriote was elected in the Guelph riding. Brenda Chamberlain served locally as a school trustee and federally as a Member of the House of Commons. She was elected for twenty-four consecutive years of public service.",

As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes.",

His mother's identity is not known, though one source suggests Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham. As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the American Revolution.",

  "text" : "U Lwin (Burmese: ဦးလွင်; 22 October 1924 – 6 December 2011) was a career army officer (ranked Colonel) in the Burmese Army and a National League for Democracy politician, who won a parliamentary seat in the Burmese general election, 1990, after contesting the Thongwa constituency. U Lwin was born in Rangoon's Pazundaung Township to parents Ba Tha and Thein. He first joined the Burma Independence Army in 1942 and served during World War II and in anti-rebel and anti-Kuomintang campaigns in the 1940s to 1950s, after Burma declared its independence. After martial law was declared in 1962, he served various roles including Minister of Finance, deputy prime minister and member of the Revolutionary Council under the Burma Socialist Programme Party, until his resignation in 1980. U Lwin is Secretary of the NLD and is a former party Treasurer. He was among the NLD representatives who boycotted the National Convention in December 1995 and is a former BSPP Deputy Prime Minister and member of the BSPP State Council.He completed high school in Rangoon before World War II and served in the Burma Independence Army (BIA), Burma Defence Army (BDA) and with the Patriotic Burmese Force (PBF) from 1942-1945. He completed BDA officer training at the Japanese Royal Military Academy and from 1952-1954 studied at the British Royal Military Academy. He was also the Military Attaché to the USA. U Lwin was put under de facto house arrest on 22 September 2000 and released on 1 December 2000.[ Member of CRPP, Chairperson of Committee for Health and Social Affairs ] U Lwin received 18,189 valid votes or 68 % in the 1990 elections.{ The only original member of the executive committee, who was left after 1990 to help U Aung Shwe in his struggle to keep the NLD intact through the years that threatened its viability as a political party, was U Lwin, the treasurer. U Lwin had joined the Burmese Independence Army as an 18-year-old boy at the outbreak of the war. In August 1943 he was among a batch of Burmese cadets chosen to go to Japan for training at the Rikugun Shikan Gakko (army academy). By the time the young Burmese officers had completed their training in April 1945, the anti-fascist resistance movement had started and U Lwin and his fellow graduates of the military academy remained in Hakone until October 1945, making charcoal which they sold to buy food. U Lwin continued with his career in the army after independence and was sent on training courses to England and West Germany. In 1959 he was sent to Washington as military attache. On his return from the United States he spent some years as deputy commander of Central Command, then commander of South Eastern Command before he was asked to come back to Rangoon to become a deputy minister. As the military government that assumed power in 1962 took on a civilian garb under the Burmese Socialist Programme Party, U Lwin served successively as minister of finance, deputy prime minister and a member of the state council. It was as a member of the state council that he resigned in 1980. U Lwin joined the NLD in 1988 and was appointed treasurer because of his experience in finances and his unquestioned integrity. In 1992, when the NLD was forced to reorganize its executive committee, U Lwin took on the post of secretary, while U Aung Shwe became chairman. He died of natural causes at his home in Yangon's Bahan Township on 7 December 2011. He was subsequently cremated at the Yayway Cemetery.",

  "text" : "Tagak Curley (born 1944) is an Inuit leader, politician and businessman from Nunavut. As a prominent figure in the negotiations that led to the creation of Nunavut, Tagak is considered a living father of confederation in Canada. He was born in a hunting camp at Coral Harbour, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut). From 1966 to 1970, he worked as a development officer with the federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Based on his experiences, Curley became politically active and took on leadership roles at the local level to promote better living conditions for Inuit in local communities across Nunavut. From 1970-71, Curley served as the Repulse Bay settlement manager. He also acted as editor of the Keewatin Echo, the first English-Inuktitut newspaper in Canada. He was a founding member and the first president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (Inuit Tapirisat of Canada) in 1971. ITK was formed to represent Nunavut Inuit by their own organization. Curley held leadership positions with the Inuit Cultural Institute, the group that first initiated the process to recognize Nunavut as a formal territory in Canada, as well as Nunasi Corporation, an Inuit economic development organization, and in Nunavut Construction. At the territorial level, Curley served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1979 to 1987; at the time, Nunavut was under the Northwest Territories. While in government, he held several cabinet posts, including the minister of economic development, minister of Mines and Resources Secretariat, and minister of public utilities from 1984 to 1987, and minister of government services in 1986-87. He ran as a federal Liberal candidate in the 1979 election for the Nunatsiaq (now Nunavut) riding, coming in second to Peter Ittinuar. In the years following the passage of the Nunavut Act, Curley acted as business manager for Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), the organization responsible for representing the Nunavut Inuit under the Nunavut land claim agreement. In 1998, Curley was awarded the Aboriginal Lifetime Achievement award for his contribution and leadership in business. In October 2003, Curley received the Order of Canada. In the 2004 Nunavut general election, Curley was acclaimed for the Nunavut riding of Rankin Inlet North. He re-entered politics to improve local government for his people and community. After the election, Curley challenged Paul Okalik for premiership of Nunavut, but was not elected by the Legislative Assembly. He later called for Okalik to resign as premier after Okalik made derogatory remarks about a senior municipal government official from Iqaluit to that city's mayor, Elisapee Sheutiapik. In 2008, he appeared in the documentary Passage, challenging 19th century claims by Lady Franklin, widely believed at the time, that the Inuit were responsible for signs of cannibalism among her husband's doomed expedition through the Northwest Passage.",

  "text" : "Thomas P. Gaffey is an American politician. Gaffey, a Democrat, had been a state senator from Connecticut since 1995, but left office due to criminal violations on January 5, 2011. Gaffey, a resident of Meriden, has represented the towns of Cheshire, Meriden, Middlefield and Middletown in the Connecticut Senate. Gaffey was born in Meriden and graduated from Southern Connecticut State University. He was appointed in the fall of 2005 to serve as Chief Deputy Majority Leader by Senate Majority Leader Martin Looney and Senate President Pro Tempore Donald E. Williams, Jr., and previously served in the position. Gaffey also serves as an executive with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. In 2002, he was linked to meetings with failed energy firm Enron. He was also cited that year for spending over $10,000 in personal expenses on his authority expense account, and failing to make timely reimbursement, but later issued a CRRA check for more than $1,600 to repay amounts reimbursed in excess. In January 2009 the Hartford Courant announced state auditors were looking into other instances of improper reimbursement by Gaffey, including double billing of out of state travel to both the state government and his political action committee. On January 18, the Courant urged the State Senate to censure Gaffey for his ethical improprieties. On May 6, 2009, the State Election Enforcement Commission announced that Gaffey and his campaign treasurer had agreed to a settlement over the double billing complaint. In one of the largest fines levied by the Commission, Gaffey agreed to a $6,000 fine and his treasurer agreed to a $3,000 fine. Gaffey also agreed to dissolve his political action committee and forfeit its $20,000 balance to the state. The commission's enforcement director called Gaffey's record keeping \"disastrous\". The charges later led to a criminal investigation and Gaffey's resignation. In 2006 Gaffey supported legislation spearheaded by fellow Democrat Donald Williams intended to address childhood obesity in Connecticut. The legislation was however derided by opponents as the \"cupcake bill.\" As of August 2008, more than 63% of eligibile school districts have enrolled in the program. In March 2008 New Haven schools enforced this policy by suspending an eighth grader for selling a classmate skittles. In May 2008, a principal in Greenwich was suspended in a dispute over bringing cupcakes to school. In 2007 Gaffey proposed that the Governor's power to appoint the Commissioner of Education be limited. Allies of Governor Jodi Rell labelled the proposal an attempted power grab. That year Gaffey also opposed efforts to increase education aid to suburban school districts, even those represented by fellow Democrats, in favor of adding more funds to urban districts. His response to complaints from suburban legislators was \"Like everything else in those districts, that is rich!\" Gaffey has also clashed with leaders of his local school board over the installation of artificial turf. In November 2007 Gaffey suggested that the state had to impose a more stringent school integration plan on suburbs in the Hartford region. \"The notion that we're going to get a better result by voluntary programs is ridiculous,\" said state Sen. Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden, co-chairman of the legislature's education committee. \"We need to shift away from the model of remedy that the state has been pursuing for years. The district is as racially isolated today as it was 10 years ago. It suggests you need to do something different.\" Another Gaffey initiative was a bill that banned most out-of-school suspensions. Educators were unsure how they could comply with the law. In 2008 Gaffey did break with party leadership to support a Three Strikes Law to give life sentences to career violent criminals supported by Governor M. Jodi Rell. Thomas P. Gaffey was the father of three children. His son, Thomas M. Gaffey died on February 2, 2009, at the age of 16. In 2005 the Connecticut Appellate Court denied the Senator's ex-wife's request for increased child support.",

  "text" : "William Thacher Longstreth (January 1, 1920 – April 11, 2003) was a Republican member of the Philadelphia City Council who was perhaps best known for his long tenure and unique image as a wisecracking, bow tied blue blood. Longstreth, a graduate of Princeton University, was an eighth-generation Philadelphian born to Quakers William Collins (b. 1882) and Nella (née Thacher) Longstreth, who married in 1917. William C. Longstreth owned the Longstreth Motor Car Company and his family lived in Haverford, Pennsylvania, and was affluent until the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Thacher was a cousin of President Herbert Hoover and his maternal grandmother, Ella Hoover Thacher was the president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union for many years. In 1970, he led the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and spearheaded the drive to hold the annual Earth Day commemoration in Philadelphia. That event became one of the biggest Earth Day events in the nation. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Greater Delaware Valley Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He was predeceased by his half sister, Nella Cameron Downward (1913-1997). His younger brother, Frank Hoover Longstreth (b. 1922) died in 2008. He was a two-time Republican nominee for Mayor of Philadelphia, first in 1955, losing to Richardson Dilworth, and again in 1971, losing to Frank Rizzo. He was initially elected to Philadelphia's City Council in 1967, resigning his seat to run for Mayor in 1971. While a member of City Council, he served as a sideline reporter on Philadelphia Eagles radio broadcasts on WIP in 1969 and 1970. Longstreth was again elected to Council in 1983, defeating incumbent councilwoman Beatrice Chernock for the at-large seat he had vacated twelve years earlier to run for Mayor. He would remain in office until his death. During his tenure on Council, Longstreth helped support the efforts of Edmund Bacon to bring an urban renaissance to Philadelphia. He was also well known for wearing bow ties and argyle socks. He suffered from Parkinson's disease, and died of a pulmonary embolism while on vacation in Naples, Florida.",

Taue studierte Jura an der Universität Kyūshū. Nach seiner Graduierung begann er in der Stadtverwaltung von Nagasaki zu arbeiten und war zuerst in den Bereichen Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Tourismus tätig. Als der amtierende Bürgermeister Itchō Itō April 2007 nach einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung kurz vor den einheitlichen Regionalwahlen 2007 von dem Yakuza-Mitglied Tetsuya Shiroo niedergeschossen wurde und infolge seines hohen Blutverlustes starb, entschied sich Taue für das Amt des Bürgermeisters zu kandidieren. Er trat hierbei gegen Makoto Yokoo, den Schwiegersohn Itōs, an. Taue, der nun seine Kandidatur erst fünf Tage vor der Wahl einbrachte, versuchte Yokoos Kandidatur als Nepotismus und Patronage darzustellen. Viel Wähler wiederum empfanden das Festhalten an dem Wahltermin so kurz nach Itōs Tod für taktlos und so kam es dazu, dass einige Wähler Wahlzettel mit Itōs Namen beschrifteten oder protestwählten. Nach einem knappen Ergebnis und mehreren Nachzählungen, wurde Taue mit einem Vorsprung von 953 Stimmen zum Bürgermeister gewählt. Wie schon sein Vorgänger setzt sich auch Taue gegen Atomwaffen ein. Kurz nach seiner Wahl zum Bürgermeister kritisierte er Fumio Kyūma für dessen am 30. Juni 2007 in einer Rede in der Reitaku-Universität bekundeten Äußerungen zum Atombombenabwurf auf Nagasaki. Ebenso kritisierte er den liberaldemokratischen Politiker Taku Yamasaki für dessen Aussagen über nordkoreanische Atomwaffentests, in denen Yamasaki sie als nützlich zur Erkenntnis über die nordkoreanische Atomwaffenkapazität bezeichnet hatte. Yamasaki äußerte sich später dahingehend, das er genauso wie Taue ein Gegner von Atomwaffen ist.",

Prior to being elected as a MLA, Lake was elected to one term (2005–2008) as mayor of the City of Kamloops and one term (2002–2005) as a councillor of the city.

Lovink werd secretaris-generaal van het Departement van Algemene Oorlogvoering van de Nederlandse regering in ballingschap, Warners werd raad-adviseur. Lovink werd na een diplomatieke en ambtelijke carrière in mei 1949 als opvolger van Beel Hoge Vertegenwoordiger van de Kroon in Nederlands-Indië. Hij trad in die functie niet altijd even gelukkig op en bleef na de soevereiniteitsoverdracht in december 1949 niet in Indonesië, zoals aanvankelijk wel de bedoeling was. Hij werd ambassadeur in Canada, waar hij ook deken van het Corps Diplomatique was, en Australië, en in 1960 wederom in Canada. Daar bleef hij ook wonen.",

He saw the aggressive Germanization of Polish territories controlled by the German Empire as the major threat to Polish culture and therefore advocated a degree of accommodation with another power that had partitioned Poland, the Russian Empire. He favored the re-establishment of Polish independence by nonviolent means, and supported policies favorable to the Polish middle class. During World War I, in Paris, through his Polish National Committee he was a prominent spokesman, to the Allies, for Polish aspirations. He was a principal figure instrumental in the postwar restoration of Poland's independent existence. Dmowski never wielded official political power, except for a brief period in 1923 as minister of foreign affairs. Nevertheless, he was one of the most influential Polish ideologues and politicians of his time. A controversial personality all his life and since, Dmowski believed that only a Polish-speaking andRoman Catholic could be a good Pole; his thinking marginalized other minorities, and he was vocally anti-semitic. In 1926 he attempted to emulate Italian fascism. He remains the prototype of Polish right-wing nationalism and has been called \"the father of Polish nationalism.\" Throughout most of his life, he was the chief opponent of the Polish military and political leader Józef Piłsudski and of the latter's vision of Poland as a multinational federation.",

  "text" : "Robert Law McCartney, QC (born 24 April 1936) is a Northern Irish barrister and a former leader of the UK Unionist Party. He was initially a member of the Ulster Unionist Party but was expelled in June 1987 when he refused to withdraw from the general election of that year. He stood against the incumbent Popular Unionist Party MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a \"Real Unionist\" but failed to win the seat. In the 1995 by-election in North Down after the death of Kilfedder he was elected as a \"UK Unionist\" defeating the Ulster Unionist Party candidate. He subsequently established the United Kingdom Unionist Party to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum and the related talks which startedin 1996. The other party representatives to the Forum were Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien and Cedric Wilson, a former low-level DUP member in the 1980s. McCartney retained his Westminster seat in the 1997 election. He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson East Antrim). However, Wilson, Roche, Boyd and Hutchinson parted company with McCartney in December 1998 because of their leader's so-called 'exit strategy' from the Northern Ireland Assembly in the event of Sinn Féin being allowed seats in the new Northern Ireland Government. McCartney denounced them, saying all four 'were famous in their own living rooms' and that their supporters 'could fit into a telephone box.' In 2008 both Wilson and Boyd attended meetings of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice. In 1999, Robert McCartney ran for the party in elections to the European Parliament, winning 2.9% of the first preference vote. He lost his Westminster seat in the 2001 election to the UUP candidate Lady Hermon. He was committed to a policy of integration for Northern Ireland, whereby legislative devolution for Northern Ireland would no longer be Westminster's abiding policy, there would be no Stormont legislative assembly and the province would be a fully participating part of the United Kingdom; at the same time the three main British political parties would fully organise in Northern Ireland. He was the president of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1986, and led it in its four years of prominence after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. McCartney resigned as head of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1988 over a dispute with its executive. These integrationist policies, once popular in some sections of Unionism, receded with the introduction of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and the creation of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. However it is the case that other parts of the United Kingdom with devolved assemblies are fully covered by the three main British political parties, but not in Northern Ireland. McCartney also strongly opposed the St Andrews Agreement and in 2007 stood on an anti-agreement ticket in six different constituencies. He lost his own seat in North Down, polling 1,806 first preference votes (5.9% of the total, and less than half the quota required to be elected). He also obtained 360 votes (1.2%) in Belfast North, 388 votes (0.8%) in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 853 votes (2.0%) in Lagan Valley, 893 votes (2.3%) in South Antrim and 220 votes (0.5%) in West Tyrone He claims to have retired from politics following the loss of his seat in the 2007 Assembly Election to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. However, he still occasionally makes media appearances and writes newspaper articles and in October 2009, Robert McCartney was guest speaker at the Traditional Unionist Voice party conference in Belfast, where he spoke on the situation surrounding the primary school transfer test, brought about by a Sinn Féin Education Minister.",

In 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate \"Liberal-Labour\" platform. He ran for Vancouver's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power. Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. Ralph Smith was a supporter of women's suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed.",

  "text" : "Rick Doucet (born in Sussex, New Brunswick) is a New Brunswick businessman and politician. He currently represents the riding of Fundy-The Isles-Saint John West in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. Rick lives in St. George with his wife and two children, Nicole and Jonathan. Doucet has had a varied career working in the air industry both as a marketing and sales official with a commercial airline and later as a cargo pilot. He started his own series of businesses in 1989 eventually working simultaneously in the restaurant, photography and advertising industries. A Liberal, he was a member of the opposition shadow cabinet. He was critic for the Department of Energy from his first election in June 2003 until becoming critic for Fisheries & Aquaculture in February, 2005. Doucet received favourable media attention when, shortly following his appointment as Energy Critic, he toured the province to visit all of its power generation facilities at his own expense. He was re-elected in the 2006 election following which he joined the cabinet. One October 3, 2006 he was sworn in as Minister of Fisheries under the Shawn Graham government. He maintained this role throughout all of the four years the Liberals were in government. Despite the losses received by the Shawn Graham Liberals in the 2010 provincial election, Doucet retained his seat, beating out the Progressive Conservative candidate Sharon Tucker. Doucet would sit in Opposition from 2010 to 2014, with his riding remaining the only Liberal controlled riding in southwestern New Brunswick. During his time in Opposition, Doucet was critic, at various periods, of Energy, Transportation and Public Safety. As critic for Public Safety, Doucet was very vocal in his displeasure with the Government's reaction to the flooding of December 2010 and Hurricane Arthur in July 2014. In the 2014 election, Doucet's riding was affected by the 2013 electoral redistribution in New Brunswick. For this election, Doucet's principal challenger was incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA Jim Parrott. On September 22, 2014 Doucet was re-elected for a 4th consecutive time.",

As of October 2007 he was chair of the Finance & Budget and Budget Committees, vice-chair of the Economic Development & Neighborhoods Committee, and a member of the Housing, Human Services & Health Committee. In his 2001 campaign, he defeated music critic, monorail booster and author Grant Cogswell. In a film about that campaign, Grassroots, McIver was played by Cedric the Entertainer. McIver chaired the City Council’s Housing & Economic Development Committee. He was vice-chair of the Environment, Emergency Management and Utilities Committee and was a member of the Transportation Committee. He was an alternate member of the Energy & Technology Committee. (From 2004 through 2007 he was the chair of the Council’s Budget & Finance Committee.) McIver was strongly identified with Rainier Valley, one of Seattle's poorer neighborhoods. According to at least one obituary, his greatest achievement in office was the creation of a $50 million Rainier Valley Community Development Fund, and he was \"deeply worried\" about Link Light Rail impacting \"immigrant- and minority-owned businesses along Rainier Avenue.\" During the protests surrounding the Seattle World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999, McIver, on his way to an official dinner, was, according to fellow councilmember Jean Godden, \"stopped by a Seattle policeman who did not recognize him as a council member, refused to believe he was a public official, and insisted on making him stand spreadeagled up against his car.\" \"He never forgot that, not so much because of the indignity to him, but that others did not believe an African American might be a city councilmember.\" McIver died on March 9, 2013, at the age of 71 in Seattle.",

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice and Howden, Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, having previously been Minister of State at the Foreign Office from July 1994 to April 1997. Davis was raised on Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, South West London. After attending Bec Grammar School in Tooting, London, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with Tate & Lyle. Entering Parliament in 1987 at the age of 38 for the Boothferry constituency, in his subsequent political career he held the positions of Conservative party chairman and Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the shadow cabinet, under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and then second. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary. This was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP in June 2008, he officially became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won it in July 2008. In 2010, Davis was invited by Prime Minister David Cameron to join the cabinet of his coalition government, but he declined and stayed on the backbenches. In July 2016, following the UK voting to leave the European Union, Davis was appointed by Theresa May as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.",

Ikeda is the founding president of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), the world's largest Buddhist lay organization, with approximately 12 million practitioners in 192 countries and regions. Ikeda was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1928, to a family of seaweed farmers. He survived the devastation of World War II as a teenager, which he said left an indelible mark on his life and fueled his quest to solve the fundamental causes of human conflict. At age 19, Ikeda began practicing Nichiren Buddhism and joined a youth group of the Soka Gakkai Buddhist association, which led to his lifelong work developing the global peace movement of SGI and founding numerous institutions dedicated to fostering peace, culture and education. Ikeda's vision for the SGI has been described by academic observers as a \"borderless Buddhist humanism that emphasizes free thinking and personal development based on respect for all life.\" In the 1960s, Ikeda worked to reopen Japan's relationship with China, to establish the Soka education network of humanistic schools from kindergartens through universities, and he began writing The Human Revolution. In the 1970s, he established the Soka Gakkai International and initiated numerous international educational and cultural exchanges for peace. Since the 1980s, he has continually increased his anti-nuclear activism and citizen diplomacy. As of 2015, Ikeda has published more than 50 dialogues with scholars, peace activists and leading world figures. In his role as SGI president, Ikeda has visited 55 nations and spoken on subjects including peace, environment, economics, women's rights, interfaith dialogue, nuclear disarmament, Buddhism and science, and various other topics. Every year on the anniversary of the SGI's founding, January 26, Ikeda submits a peace proposal to the United Nations.",

He was elected to Ottawa City Council in the 2010 municipal election and re-elected for a second term in 2014. He is the former senior deputy to the leader of the Green Party of Canada, and a former leadership contestant for that party. A graduate of Queen's University (Political Science) and alumnus of Cambridge University (International Relations), Chernushenko has worked for the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) and the United Nations Environment Programme. He has served on committees and boards of local housing and environment groups, schools and health advisory bodies. Chernushenko is a “green building” professional accredited by the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification program. As owner of the consulting firm Green & Gold Inc. since 1998, he has advised public, private, and non-profit organizations on adopting more sustainable and socially responsible practices. From 1998 to 2004, Chernushenko served on the International Olympic Committee’s commission on Sport and the Environment. He has written several books on sustainable management practices, including Sustainable Sport Management (UNEP, 2001) and Greening Our Games: Running Sports Events & Facilities that Won't Cost the Earth (Centurion, 1994), and the electronic publication Greening Campuses and their Communities (IISD/ACCC/UNEP, 1996). In 2001, he co-founded Clean Air Champions, a national charity that engages athletes in raising awareness about air pollution, climate change and the benefits of physical activity in Canada. He is a director of the Sustainable Ottawa Energy Co-operative. He was the Green Party candidate for Ottawa Centre in the 2004 federal election. He finished fourth with 4,730 votes (8%), receiving more votes than any other Green candidate in Ottawa. He ran again in Ottawa Centre in the 2006 federal election and again came fourth, losing to Paul Dewar from the New Democratic Party (NDP). Chernushenko received 6,766 votes (10.2%), the highest vote count of any Green Party candidate in Canada the 2006 election. He passed the 10% threshold, thus becoming eligible for partial government reimbursement of campaign expenditures. Chernushenko was endorsed by the Ottawa Citizen newspaper in the 2004 and 2006 elections. He also ran as the Green Party candidate in Ottawa South in the 2003 Ontario general election. On November 10, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Chernushenko to Canada's National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, a non-partisan panel that advises the federal government on environmental policy, and works to promote the integrated pursuit of excellence in environmental, social and economic practices in Canada’s public, private and civil society sectors. Chernushenko served as a member on the NRTEE from 2006 to 2009, and served as vice-chair in 2008-2009. Chernushenko resigned as deputy leader of the Green Party in July 2007 in order to devote more time to his international consulting business and the NRTEE, and to make documentary films. Since then, he has launched the Living Lightly multimedia project and produced three documentaries, titled Be the Change (2008), Powerful: Energy for Everyone (2010) and Bike City, Great City (2013). Chernushenko ran as City Councillor for Capital Ward in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election. He won with 41.34% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2014.",

He was re-elected as mayor in 2006, 2009 and 2012. At the end of his current term in 2016, he will become the longest-serving mayor in Saskatoon's history at 13 years. Prior to being mayor, Atchison was first elected to Saskatoon's city council as a councillor for Ward 10 in 1994, and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. As a city councillor, Atchison suggested a part of downtown Saskatoon should be enclosed by a $80 million 10-storey climate-controlled glass atrium, dubbed the \"Atreos.\" He also is known to be precise about his dress, as he owns a men's clothing store. On his first election as mayor, he required citizens visiting the Mayor's office to be formally dressed, a policy that was soon dropped after being criticized. Both points were ridiculed by CBC satirist Rick Mercer who sponsored an online contest that went on to name Atchison \"Canada's Craziest Mayor.\"",

He was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general selection, succeeding the outgoing speaker Bernard Weatherill who was retiring from the Commons. The Croydon seats were reorganised ahead of the 1997 General Election, with the loss of one seat. Congdon competed against Sir Paul Beresford, then MP for Croydon Central, for the Conservative nomination for the new merged seat and won. He then lost in the ensuing election in 1997 to Labour's Geraint Davies. Sir Paul Beresford, meanwhile, successfully contested Mole Valley and continued as an MP. Congdon stood once again against Geraint Davies at the 2001 election and lost. He then worked for MENCAP, and did not stand again at the 2005 election, when the Conservative candidate Andrew Pelling recaptured the seat from Davies. Congdon is now retired and lives, with his wife, Theresa, in Old Coulsdon.",

  "text" : "Diane Elizabeth Deans is a member of Ottawa City Council, Canada, representing Gloucester-Southgate Ward in the city's southeast, representing more than 49,500 residents. A graduate of the University of Guelph she was active in the Canadian Federation of Students before becoming a staffer on Parliament Hill. Deans was first elected to Ottawa city council in 1994. Prior to Ottawa and its surrounding municipalities were amalgamated in 2001, she faced a tough election against George Barrett. In the 2003 Ottawa election, she handily defeated two lesser-known opponents. After victory in the 2006 Ottawa election, Deans began her fifth term as Councillor for Gloucester-Southgate ward. In the 2010 election, Deans was re-elected in her Gloucester-Southgate Ward. She was once again re-elected in 2014 for her seventh consecutive term. Deans considers herself a centrist member of council but traditionally takes a liberal stance on most issues. In the mid-2000s, Deans' main concern had been the creation of a new branch for the Ottawa Public Library in her rapidly growing ward, now called the Greenboro Library. She also supported by-laws limiting smoking in the city, while not supporting a lawn pesticide bylaw in 2002 and 2005. She has engaged in public clashes with Mayor Bob Chiarelli while advocating for her ward. Deans is the Chairperson of the City's Community and Protective Services Committee of the City of Ottawa. She also sits on the Transportation Committee, the Finance and Economic Development Committee, Member Services Committee, and the Ottawa Community Lands Development Corporation. She is currently co-chair of the Seniors' Roundtable. Deans sought the federal Liberal nomination in the riding of Ottawa South in 2004. She lost to David McGuinty. She was seen as a possible candidate to challenge Chiarelli for the mayoralty in 2006, but chose to run for re-election in Gloucester-Southgate Ward. In March 2007, Diane Deans announced that she had been approached by members of the Ontario Liberal Party urging her to seek the party's nomination for the riding of Ottawa Centre. She received the support of the sitting MPP Richard Patten. On June 4, 2007, she lost the provincial nomination to Yasir Naqvi. Deans was married to former New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Ian Deans for 22 years.",

She was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, and graduated from McGill University with a degree in Physical Education. She taught at McGill and the University of Toronto before moving to Ottawa. She was first elected to Ottawa city council in 1982 in a surprise victory over veteran alderman Joe Cassey. On city council, her priorities include housing, urban planning, community development, transportation, social services, women's issues and social justice causes. As a previous head of Heritage Ottawa she worked to preserve heritage structures. She was easily re-elected in 1985 and 1988. She considered a bid for the mayoralty in 1991, but ended up supporting fellow progressive Nancy Smith who came in a strong second (36%) to Jacquelin Holzman (40%). Holmes was easily re-elected to council in 1991. In 1994 Holmes moved to the council of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, facing little opposition in her bid. She was acclaimed in 1998 and retired from council in 2000 when the regional municipality was abolished and replaced with the new amalgamated City of Ottawa. In 2003 she returned to city council, winning another convincing victory in her previous ward. Holmes was similarly re-elected in 2006. Holmes supported a bylaw to require property owners to promptly remove graffiti. Holmes was re-elected in 2011.",

  "text" : "David Zirnhelt (born 1947) is a Canadian politician. He was born in Williams Lake, British Columbia, located in the Cariboo region of the province's central interior. He obtained an undergraduate and graduate degree from the University of British Columbia in political science and public administration, returning to the Williams Lake area, where he became a cattle rancher and a practitioner of horse logging. He was also active as a consultant in various federal, provincial, and First Nations projects related to public policy and economic development. Zirnhelt began his political career when he served as a director of the Cariboo Regional District from 1974 to 1977. In 1987, he was elected as a trustee of the Cariboo-Chilcotin School District. Zirnhelt made the leap to provincial politics in 1989, winning the seat of Cariboo in a by-election for the social democratic British Columbia New Democratic Party. The riding had, until then, been a stronghold of the conservative British Columbia Social Credit Party for almost forty years. Zirnhelt would go on to be re-elected in 1991 and 1996 in the riding of Cariboo South (the old Cariboo riding was abolished with the 1991 election). With the election of a New Democratic government in 1991, Premier Mike Harcourt appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Economic Development, Small Business and Trade. He later served as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. Following Harcourt's resignation, Premier Glen Clark appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Forests — a powerful portfolio in a province where forestry is a major economic sector. In that position, Zirnhelt initiated an intensive review of the province's forest practices, as concerns mounted over the logging of old growth forests and the insufficient restocking of logged areas by timber companies. Zirnhelt failed in his attempt at re-election in 2001.",

Stworzył też pierwszą z sal widowiskowych obecnie Allstate Arena. Kilka lat temu burmistrz starał się uzyskać zgodę na zbudowanie kasyna w Rosemont jednak przedstawiciele Illinois cofnęli wydaną wcześniej zgodę spowodowaną rzekomą współpracą z grupami przestępczymi.

Jones ran as an independent candidate, however, and defeated Dumaresque in the general election. She later joined the Liberal caucus. He later served as John Efford's campaign manager in the party's leadership convention in 2001. He subsequently threatened to sue the victorious candidate, Roger Grimes, for libel after Grimes reportedly stated that he \"would never be able to sleep any one night in comfort, knowing he had a minister in confidence who had Danny Dumaresque as an advisor to him.\" He also served as president of the provincial Liberal Party from 2006 until 2009. He was succeeded in this role by Judy Morrow. Dumaresque ran as the Liberal candidate in Torngat Mountains in the 2007 election, but lost to Patty Pottle. He was also frequently rumoured as a possible candidate for the leadership of the provincial Liberal party in their 2010 leadership election. After he had previously stated that he would not rule it out, on July 29, 2010 he announced he would not run and would instead focus on his business career. In March 2011, he announced that he was considering running for the Liberals in the 2011 provincial election in the district of Lake Melville, but on August 22, 2011, he was acclaimed as the party's candidate in The Isles of Notre Dame and lost in the general election. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the leadership election to replace Yvonne Jones in August 2011. On July 2, 2013 Dumaresque announced he was running for the leadership of the provincial Liberal Party in their 2013 election. He was, again, ultimately unsuccessful in his bid to lead the party. Dumaresque ran for the Liberal nomination in Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair for the 2015 provincial election but lost to Lisa Dempster.

Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens.",

MacInnis defeated Gillis again in a rematch almost a year later in the 1958 general election, known as the \"Diefenbaker Sweep.\" MacInnis remained a Member of Parliament throughout the 1960s and early 1970s except for the 25th Parliament when he was defeated in the riding by Malcolm Vic MacInnis of the New Democratic Party in the 1962 election. Since the 1968 election, MacInnis represented Cape Breton—East Richmond, one of the ridings which replaced the Cape Breton South electoral district in a boundary realignment. After his term in the 29th Parliament ended in 1974, MacInnis left national office and did not campaign for another term. From 1988, MacInnis served as the final Mayor of Glace Bay, a municipality which was dissolved in 1995 and replaced by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.",

Lopez was appointed to serve in the dual role of both the Secretary of Commerce and Tourism as well as the Executive Director of the Department of Commerce. However, in 2013, Lopez's position was reorganized by separating Commerce agencies from Tourism agencies, retitling his position to simply \"Secretary of Commerce\". On November 2, 2012, Lopez resigned his position as Executive Director but retained the Cabinet Secretary office. The duties of Executive Director were then given to the former Deputy, Jonna Kerschner. Lopez resigned as Secretary of Commerce on August 26, 2013 effective August 30, 2013 after being named as the interim Superintendent of Schools for the Oklahoma City Public School District, succeeding Karl Springer. In October, 2013, Fallin appointed then Oklahoma Secretary of State Larry Parman to serve as the new Secretary of Commerce as well as the Executive Director for the Department of Commerce.",

Sutton was elected in the newly created riding of York--Scarborough which comprised all of the then Borough of Scarborough, Ontario. The population of the borough increased so much, between 1955 and 1963, that it was further subdivided in four ridings for the 1967 provincial general election, making Sutton the only MPP to ever represent the riding. He served as a backbench member of a succession of PC majority governments led by Premiers Leslie Frost and then John Robarts. Despite his lengthy time in office, Lewis did not serve in Cabinet, but he was a member of up to ten Standing Committees of the Legislative Assembly, simultaneously, with a particular interest in committees dealing with municipal law, agriculture, education and conservation. Sutton was married, in 1943, to Margherita May Hodgson (1900 - 1985), who, in turn, was related to three other Members of Provincial Parliament, Ronald Glen Hodgson, Louis Hodgson and Chris Hodgson.",

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Yap.) Yap Kwan Seng (Chinese: 叶观盛, 1846–1902) was the last Chinese kapitan of Kuala Lumpur from 1889 to 1902. Kapitans were appointed chiefs or headmen of the various ethnic communities during the British colonial rule in what is present-day Malaysia. Kapitans played an important role in the history of the Chinese in Malaysia. They wielded considerable influence, contributing to social, economic and political development in areas under their jurisdiction. Yap Kwan Seng, of Hakka descent, was born in 1846 in the Chak Kai district of China. He moved to Malaya at the age of 18 and worked as a tin miner in Seremban. On his death, The Straits Times carried the following obituary: TOWKAY Yap Kwan Seng, the Captain China of Selangor, died at Kuala Lumpur on Friday, of consumption, at the age of fifty-five years, of which he had spent forty in the Straits. He came from the Canton province and had resided thirty-two years in Selangor. He had held the post of Captain China there since 1889. The deceased was popular among all classes and was a liberal giver to charities. He was a Trustee of the Victoria Institution to whose funds he liberally subscribed. He gave $10,000 to the Transvaal War Fund and also a handsome donation to St. Mary's Church building fund. He was always a good friend to his poorer countrymen, for whom he established a practically free dispensary. During the Pahang rebellion he rendered much assistance to the Government and was thanked for his services. He leaves behind him five wives here and three in China, also a large family consisting of fifteen sons and ten daughters.",

  "text" : "Heath Nelson Macquarrie (September 18, 1919 – January 2, 2002) was a Canadian politician, teacher, scholar, and writer. Macquarrie described himself as a Red Tory, using the term in the title of his autobiography Red Tory Blues. During the October Crisis of 1970, he agonized over the implementation of the War Measures Act, and was prepared to vote against it, but relented for the sake of keeping the Tory caucus united behind Robert Stanfield. Writing in retrospect, Macquarrie described his vote in favour of the Act as \"fundamentally wrong\". He was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1957 federal election that brought John Diefenbaker to power. He served as a member of parliament for twenty-two consecutive years, until he was elevated to the Canadian Senate in 1979 on the advice of Joe Clark. He sat in the upper house for a further fifteen years, retiring at the mandatory age of 75 in 1994. He was publicly loyal to Clark's successor, Brian Mulroney, but privately disagreed with the government on several occasions, once saying during a caucus meeting, \"You know, a lot of people think I have a prominent nose because of my enjoyment of a certain beverage. Well, that's all nonsense. I got it that way by having to hold it so often while voting for some of Mulroney's bills.\" Macquarrie remained active following his retirement from the Senate in 1994, by contributing a column to the Hill Times and to newspapers in his home province of Prince Edward Island. Macquarrie was educated at Prince of Wales College, the University of Manitoba, the University of New Brunswick and McGill University. He studied for his doctorate at McGill, choosing for his thesis topic Robert Borden. He lectured at Brandon University and at Mount Allison University, in economics, political science and international relations. He edited and wrote the introduction to the published edition of Sir Robert Borden's diaries. An admirer of the World War I-era prime minister, Macquarrie considered Borden to be the architect of Canadian independence.",

  "text" : "Ida Chong (Chinese: 張杏芳; pinyin: Zhāng Xìngfāng; born 1956 or 1957) was previously British Columbia's Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development and was Minister Responsible for the Asia-Pacific Initiative as well as Minister of Technology, Trade, and Economic Development; Minister of Community Services; and Minister Responsible for Women's and Senior's Services (June 2005 - June 2008); Minister of Advanced Education (December 2004 to June 2005); and Minister of State for Women's and Senior's Services (January - December 2004). She was appointed Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development in March 2011. Chong was the BC Liberal MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. She was first elected in 1996 and was re-elected in 2001, 2005, and 2009. Born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia, Chong began her political career in 1993 as a municipal councillor for the District of Saanich. She ran her own accounting firm with business partner Karen Kesteloo and is a fellow of the Certified General Accountant of BC (FCGA). She was awarded a CGA-BC lifetime membership in September 2014. On September 18, 2014, Chong announced her intention to run for mayor of the City of Victoria in the November 2014 municipal election which she subsequently lost, coming a distant third to new mayor, Lisa Helps and previous mayor Dean Fortin. While Chong lost badly, it was widely speculated that she knew she could not win but instead wanted to ensure previous mayor Fortin, who ran a campaign primarily with backing of the New Democratic Party (NDP), would not win. Chong successfully set the ballot question based on Fortin's mishandling of the Johnson Street Bridge Replacement Project but simply did not have enough voters to make an impact. Fortin ultimately lost to Helps by a mere 89 votes. While Chong's running in a known left-wing municipal election after a long and successful career as a Provincial Cabinet Minister was baffling to many, the speculation is that Chong knew she could pull votes from the moderate Fortin, with a long-term strategy to strengthen the Green/Progressive vote in the region and province thus weakening the New Democratic Party by splitting the leftist vote.",

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014.",

He served as the 14th Governor of Indiana during the American Civil War, and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln. During the war, Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly. He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval, and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans. He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers. As one of President Lincoln's \"war governors\", Morton made signification contributions to the war effort, more than any other man in the state, and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support. During his second term as governor, and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke, he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during his second term in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.",

She is currently Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand, after serving as a member of the Niue Assembly (national Parliament) and a minister in Toke Talagi's government. She was previously a long-standing leading figure in the informal parliamentary Opposition to Young Vivian's government. She was, from 2008 to 2011, Minister of Health, Minister of Public Works, Minister of Women’s Affairs, and Minister in charge of the Niue Power Corporation. She had previously been Minister of Education, Health, Environment, Training and Development. Additionally, Jacobsen is a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and Patroness of the Niuean Volleyball Association. Following the 1999 general election, she was a candidate for the post of Premier (head of government), who is selected by the national Assembly. She lost to Sani Lakatani, of the Niue People's Party, by six votes to fourteen. Following the 2005 general election, Jacobsen was Young Vivian's only opponent contending for the position of Premier. She was defeated by three votes to seventeen. Vivian thanked her for competing against him: \"That the selection was contested, thanks to Ekepule [member of the Assembly] O’love Jacobsen, confirms our determination under the Westminster system of government to adhere and uphold one of the fundamental principles of democracy.\" In February 2008, Jacobsen stated that landowners had been bullied into authorising the building of a hotel and golf course on their land, a project supported by the government and funded by Chinese investors. Premier Young Vivian rejected the allegation. In the lead-up to the 2008 general election, which saw her successfully retain her seat in the Assembly (as a common roll representative, Jacobsen was critical of the fact that several members of the Assembly would be re-elected unopposed. She accused Vivian of discouraging people from taking part in the election as Opposition candidates, and argued that a democracy requires voters being able to choose between several candidates in each constituency. \"If the principle of democracy is going to be upheld, then it is very important that people do need to go to the polls and not have them unopposed and become duly elected.\" Vivian rejected Jacobsen's criticism, and argued in return that candidates were chosen within the villages, in traditional ways. With such a practice, he said, \"there is no conflict, there’s peace and togetherness.\" A government news publication stated with thinly veiled criticism that Jacobsen \"saw herself as a self-appointed backbench champion of the masses\". Following the election, Jacobsen supported Toke Talagi's candidacy to prime ministership, against Vivian, and was appointed to Talagi's small Cabinet. In March 2011, she resigned from government and from the Assembly to be appointed Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand.",

While leader of Westminster City Council she oversaw the \"Building Stable Communities\" policy, later described as the \"homes for votes\" scandal and was consequently accused of gerrymandering. The policy was judged illegal by the district auditor, and a surcharge of £27m levied on her in 1996. This was later raised to £42 million with interest and costs. She eventually settled in 2004, paying a \"full and final settlement\" of £12.3 million. Porter moved to Herzliya Pituah, Israel, in 1994 during the inquiry, and returned to London in 2006.

  "text" : "Sir Richard Stafford Cripps, CH, PC, FRS (24 April 1889 – 21 April 1952) was a British Labour politician of the first half of the 20th century. A wealthy barrister by background, he entered Parliament at a by-election in 1931, and was one of a handful of Labour front-benchers to retain his seat in the general election that autumn. He became a leading spokesman for the left and cooperation in a Popular Front with Communists before 1939, in which year he was expelled from the Labour Party. During World War II he served as Ambassador to the USSR (1940–42), during which time he grew wary of the Soviet Union, but achieved great public popularity because of the entry of the USSR into the war, causing him to be seen in 1942 as a potential rival to Churchill for the premiership. He became a member of the War Cabinet of the wartime coalition, but failed in his efforts (the \"Cripps Mission\") to resolve the wartime crisis in India, where his proposals were too radical for Churchill and the cabinet, and too conservative for Gandhi and other Indian leaders. He later served as Minister of Aircraft Production, an important post but outside the inner War Cabinet. Rejoining the Labour Party in 1945, after the war he served in the Attlee Ministry, firstly as President of the Board of Trade and between 1947 and 1950 as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the latter position, Cripps was responsible for laying the foundations of Britain’s post-war economic prosperity, and was, according to historian Kenneth O. Morgan, “the real architect of the rapidly improving economic picture and growing affluence from 1952 onwards.” The economy improved after 1947, benefiting from the American money given through the Marshall Plan, but was hurt by the forced devaluation of the pound in 1949. He kept rationing in place to hold down consumption during an \"age of austerity,\" promoted exports, and maintained full employment with static wages. The public especially respected \"his integrity, competence, and Christian principles.\"",

He assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in both Parliaments but the committee was not convened. In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia, he introduced the Promotion of Safe Antifreeze Act, 2007 which sought to ban ethylene glycol from antifreeze products due to its toxic effects on animals. It only received first reading but was followed by the implementation of a regulation which required the addition of a foul-tasting agent to antifreeze. He sat on the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture which studied economic and environmental effects of fish farms and delivered recommendations to the Legislative Assembly. In the 39th Parliament, he introduced the Cave Protection Act, 2010 which proposed to create a registry of all cave sites and create legal protection for them. He sat on the Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides which studied the potential for regulations for cosmetic pesticide use. During the 2011 NDP leadership election, Fraser endorsed John Horgan, though Adrian Dix went on to win and replace Carole James as leader of the BC NDP. Prior to becoming an MLA, Fraser served one term (1996–1999) as mayor of Tofino, British Columbia. Prior to being mayor he operated a bed and breakfast. After serving as mayor he worked as a manager at a shellfish farm. He had also stood for election during the 2004 federal election, as the New Democratic Party nominee in the Nanaimo—Alberni electoral district.

  "text" : "Shawn A-in-chut Atleo, kurz Shawn Atleo (* 16. Januar 1967 in Vancouver), ist ein kanadischer Politiker. Er ist Angehöriger der Ahousaht und von 2009 bis 2014 National Chief bzw. Chef national der Versammlung der First Nations. Atleo ist seit 1999 Erbhäuptling (hereditary chief) der Ahousaht, die an der Westküste von Vancouver Island, insbesondere auf Flores Island leben, und folgte darin seinem Vater. Atleo entstammt einer Häuptlingsfamilie, die sich 26 Generationen zurückverfolgen kann. Atleo, der Ururgroßvater des Ahousaht-Häuptlings Sam, hatte eine Vision während der Jagd im Tofino Inlet. Ein Otter verwandelte sich in einen Adler. Er machte in seiner Kindheit auf Flores Island vor der Westküste Vancouver Islands Erfahrungen mit Armut, die ihn tief geprägt haben. Schlecht dem extrem feuchten Klima der Westküste angepasste Behausungen und Selbstmorde unter seinen Freunden verstärkten seine Haltung, für bessere Bildung und Behausung, gegen Armut und Krankheit anzugehen. Seine Eltern beschlossen, die Insel zu verlassen. Atleo zog insgesamt 34 mal um, bevor er seinen Highschool-Abschluss machte. Auf dieser Schule lernte er seine spätere Frau Nancy kennen. Zusammen mit ihr hat er zwei erwachsene Kinder und lebt in Nanaimo. Atleo besaß ein Café am Commercial Drive in Vancouver, doch wurde er innerhalb eines Jahres von Starbucks verdrängt. Er zog in die Lobby des Campus’ des British Columbia Institute of Technology, wo er fünf Jahre lang sein Unternehmen erfolgreich führte, bevor er es an seinen Manager verkaufte. Atleo schloss 2003 sein Studium der Erwachsenenbildung an der University of Technology im australischen Sydney ab, das er als Online-Fernstudium absolvierte. Ab 2004 saß er im AFN Executive Committee, dem Exekutivrat der Versammlung der First Nations. 2008 wurde er zum Kanzler der Vancouver Island University, und damit zum ersten indigenen Kanzler in der Provinz, ähnlich wie sein Vater der erste promovierte Indianer an der University of British Columbia gewesen war. 2005 ging durch ein Übereinkommen der BC First Nations Leadership Council aus dem Regional Chief, der Union of BC Indian Chiefs und dem First Nations Summit hervor. Damit konnte die Uneinigkeit der drei indianischen Organisationen der Provinz weitgehend aufgehoben werden. Vor seiner Wahl zum Leiter der AFN war er ihr regionaler Führer in der Provinz British Columbia und er wurde 2006 von den 203 Häuptlingen der Provinz erneut in dieses Amt gewählt. Atleo war an der Erklärung über die Rechte der indigenen Völker der Vereinten Nationen beteiligt und eine der treibenden Kräfte, die das Thema der Residential Schools, auf die Tagesordnung setzten, und für die sich Premier Stephen Harper im Juni 2008 offiziell entschuldigte. Diese Entschuldigung für die schlechte Behandlung der Kinder der Ureinwohner in den für sie eingerichteten, internatartigen Schulen – mehrere tausend Klagen sind hier anhängig – hörte sich Atleo zusammen mit seiner 87-jährigen Großmutter an. Den Slogan für seine Wahlkampagne um die Leitung des AFN – It’s Our Time – formte er nach dem Vorbild Barack Obamas, der mit Yes we can seine Wahl betrieben hatte. Ähnlich wie der US-Präsident wurde er überwiegend von Jüngeren unterstützt. Nach seiner Aussage sind 54 % der Indianer Kanadas nach 1984 geboren, und Kanada sollte diesen „Tsunami der Jugend“ mit Bildung, Ausbildung und Arbeitsplätzen umfassen. Damit wandte er sich auch gegen die massive Einwanderungsförderung einiger Provinzen, die zudem die Löhne sinken ließ. Bei der Wahl setzte er sich gegen Perry Bellegarde, den Grand Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, nach acht Wahlrunden in 22 Stunden durch. Seine Wahl durch die 553 anwesenden (von 639) Häuptlinge (chiefs) nahm er in der Sprache der Ahousaht an. Atleo galt als Exponent der Gruppen, die auf Bildung, Sprachenvielfalt, Geschichte, Unterricht und Kulturwerte setzten, während Bellegarde, Häuptling der Little Black Bear First Nation in Saskatchewan, eher die ökonomische Stärkung vertrat. Atleo konzedierte vor der Versammlung: „Wir wissen, wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit ist politische Unabhängigkeit. Wirtschaftliche Macht ist politische Macht.“ Nach der Wahl galt sein erster Besuch einem Stamm in Saskatchewan, der Carry the Kettle First Nation. Damit brachte er seinen Respekt gegenüber dem in der Wahl Unterlegenen zum Ausdruck, aber auch seinen Willen, mit den sogenannten Treaty Indians eng zusammenzuarbeiten, den Stämmen also, die einen der nummerierten Verträge mit Kanada unterzeichnet haben. Ende August 2009 scheiterten die seit Jahren vorbereiteten, und von Atleo besonders betriebenen Verhandlungen über die Landnutzungsrechte der First Nations in British Columbia, die in ein Recognition and Reconciliation Act, in ein Anerkennungs- und Versöhnungsgesetz münden sollten. In British Columbia bestehen nur wenige Verträge mit den First Nations, im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Provinzen. Ein Teil der Stämme in der Provinz entzog den Unterhändlern offenbar die Unterstützung, ein Teil der Unternehmen entzog diese den Unterhändlern der 2010 wiedergewählten liberalen Regierung von Premierminister Gordon Campbell. Im Juli 2012 setzte er sich im dritten Wahlgang gegen sieben weitere Kandidaten um den Vorsitz im AFN mit 67 % der Häuptlinge des Landes durch. Zweitstärkste Kandidatin war Pamela Palmater, eine Angehörige der Mi'kmaq von der Ostküste. Atleo engagiert sich als Ratsmitglied des World Future Council für die Rechte zukünftiger Generationen. 2014 folgte ihm der 2009 unterlegene Perry Bellegarde übergangsweise im Amt des Grand Chief, nachdem Atleo wegen einer Kontroverse um Bill C-33 des Indian Act zurückgetreten war, in dem die Kontrolle über den Zugriff indigener Bildung durch die Regierung Harper verändert werden sollte. Sein politischer Kurs galt seinen Gegnern als zu eng mit dem der Regierung verbunden.",

  "text" : "Spencer Chandra Herbert is a Canadian politician who was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Representing the British Columbia New Democratic Party, he won the October 29, 2008, by-election in the electoral district of Vancouver-Burrard. He was re-elected to the Legislature, this time in the newly created riding of Vancouver-West End in the May 13, 2009 general election. Chandra Herbert's BC NDP formed the Official Opposition in both the 38th and 39th Parliaments and he was assigned to be the party's critic on tourism, arts and culture. He has introduced several pieces of legislation as private members' bills, though none have been adopted. The Long Term Tenants Protection Act, and his more comprehensive Residential Tenancy Amendment Act, were meant to address evictions and high rent increases that were occurring in the West End. He also introduced the Consumer Protection in Ticket Sales Act, 2009 which would have made ticket scalping illegal and the Gender Identity and Expression Human Rights Recognition Act which would have included gender identity and gender expression into the BC Human Rights Code as characteristic protected from discrimination. He entered the 38th Parliament at age 27, as its youngest Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and remained the youngest throughout the 39th Parliament. Prior to becoming a MLA, he was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. He served as a Parks Commissioner between 2005 and 2008 and was then a member of the Coalition of Progressive Electors. On the Parks Board he voted against removing the requirement for a referendum on an expansion of the Vancouver Aquarium but later voted in favour of the expansion. He advocate for bicycle valet service at large public events, investigating environmentally friendly means of disposing of animal waste, and implementing a zero-net-loss of greenspace policy. He is openly gay and married his partner, Romi Chandra, in March 2010. Afterwards, he legally changed his name to Spencer Chandra Herbert. Both Spencer and Romi have been active supporting causes within the LGBT community. At the provincial level, Chandra Herbert has advocated for a community victim services worker in Davie Village, a specialized telephone line for people to call to report incidents involving gay-bashing or verbal and physical assaults, and for school boards to include LGBT issues, especially in anti-bullying lessons.",

  "text" : "(For those of a similar name, see Susan Davis (disambiguation).) Susan Margaret Davies (born 14 March 1954) is a former Australian politician. She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966–70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from Latrobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; it and its predecessors had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent, emerging victorious. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Kennett-government swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \"Independents' Charter\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing Steve Bracks and the Labor Party as the new minority government. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but lost to the Liberal candidate, former MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co-operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil.",

She moved to Sydney in 2001, and studied politics and international relations at the University of New South Wales. Mitchell later moved back to Gunnedah, where she worked as an electorate officer for former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson. She continued working for Mark Coulton, Anderson's successor as local MP, upon Anderson's 2007 retirement. She was later elected president of the federal Young Nationals and chairman of the state Young Nationals, positions which she held until her election to parliament. She was preselected for the eleventh position on the Coalition Legislative Council ticket for the 2011 state election in April 2010; while normally unwinnable, the near-record size of the Coalition's victory saw her emerge victorious for the last seat in an extremely close race with far-right independent Pauline Hanson. She married Anthony Mitchell in April 2011, and took her husband's name; she had been elected two weeks before under her maiden name of Johnston. She has served on several standing and select committees, and currently sits on the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 3. During her first years in Parliament, Sarah chaired the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 4, which undertook an inquiry into medicinal cannabis, resulting in a report unanimously in favour of the provision of medicinal cannabis for the terminally ill. Sarah is currently the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional and Rural Health and Western NSW, and was appointed to this portfolio on 24 April 2015.",

He held talks with Rehman Malik in which he demanded a solid plan to end sectarian killings in Quetta and also called for a complete dissolution of the Government of Balochistan which, according to him, had completely failed to maintain law and order in the province. His father Haji Syed Hussain Hazara was also a politician and leader.",

He was also the Conservative candidate for Mid Dorset and North Poole in 2005.Hayes is now one of the minority Independent PCCs country and as such has no party-political affiliations. In May 2013, Hampshire's PCC was identified by a House of Commons Select Committee as 'being responsible for the largest increase in the budget to run the PCC's office'. According to Hampshire Police the most of a £2 million budget increase went to meet the PCC Policing and Community Priorities. In December 2013 the Hampshire PCC announced further staff; appointing more Commissioners (one Deputy and two Assistants). Hayes faced accusations that he lives in Earls Barton, Northamptonshire, where his wife is vicar of All Saints' Church. However, the IPCC was satisfied that he lived in Hampshire.",

  "text" : "Mark C. Poloncarz (born November 7, 1967) is the county executive of Erie County, New York. Poloncarz, a Democrat, was elected county executive on November 8, 2011 after defeating the incumbent county executive Chris Collins a Republican by a 53 - 47 percentage point margin. Poloncarz was re-elected on November 3, 2015 with 66% of the vote when he easily defeated the Republican candidate Raymond Walter (33% of the vote) and Green Party candidate Eric Jones (1% of the vote). Poloncarz is only the 2nd Democrat to be elected to the position of county executive in the 51-year history of the position. Entering 2015 Poloncarz was heavily favored to be re-elected county executive; however it was expected he would face a Republican challenge from one of three candidates: incumbent county clerk and former New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs, incumbent county comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, or legislator Ed Rath, the grandson of the first Erie County Executive Edward Rath. In the end, all three individuals decided not to run and Walter was chosen by the Republicans. Unlike 2015, when Poloncarz entered the race in May 2011 he was a heavy underdog. However, by focusing on issues of providing efficient, yet cost-effective government, reducing waste, fraud and abuse of the public's tax dollars, supporting the \"People's Mandates,\" and properly funding libraries and arts and cultural institutions, Poloncarz was able to chip away a sizable Collins lead until he won in surprisingly easy fashion. Poloncarz also capitalized on his \"son of a steelworker\" blue collar background against Collins self-proclaimed businessman style. Since taking office as Erie County Executive, Poloncarz worked to change the culture of Erie County government and return it to its core mission: provide the programs and services that residents and taxpayers demand as effectively and efficiently as possible. And as such, he made it a priority to restore funding for what he calls the “People’s Mandates,” which include the rodent control program, parks improvements, road and bridge construction, libraries, summer youth programming and a renewed commitment to arts and cultural organizations. These programs were restored by Poloncarz in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes. As evidence of the fiscal stewardship, in 2014, Standard & Poor’s upgraded the county’s credit rating three steps to “AA-” and in 2015 Fitch Ratings upgraded the county's credit rating to \"A+.\" In early 2015, Poloncarz released “Initiatives for a Stronger Community,” his health and human services plan for Erie County. The plan included 49 separate initiatives to address issues of poverty throughout the county, including issues facing the City of Buffalo, which was identified as the 3rd poorest city in America when Poloncarz took office in 2012. Poloncarz also shepherded a pay equity policy through the Erie County Industrial Development Agency requiring all applicants for tax incentives to agree to a policy to provide salary data to the agency to prove they do in fact pay women equally. In 2015, Poloncarz also worked with the county legislature to pass a budget for 2016 that reduced the county's property tax rate from $4.99 to $4.96 per thousand of assessed value, the second year in a row the county's tax rate was reduced. 2014 was a significant year for the Poloncarz administration, including working with the legislature to pass a balanced budget with a small tax cut, opening the Erie County Health Mall, signing an executive order requiring that all contractors with Erie County comply with equal pay laws for women, restructuring the Department of Social Services to address issues with the Division of Child Protective Services, and managing the emergency response to four major weather-related events: two blizzards, flooding in West Seneca and the worst storm to hit the region in nearly 40 years: Winter Storm Knife a/k/a Snowvember Storm. In 2013, Poloncarz announced his “Initiatives for a Smart Economy,” which represents his administration’s commitment to a comprehensive, innovative approach to economic development and provides the “missing link,” tying a host of diverse initiatives into one regional development effort. Specifically, this plan includes a total of 64 initiatives across a dozen areas, representing the economic gears that, working together, will help drive our economic future. More than half of these Initiatives are complete and showing results around Erie County. In fact, since Poloncarz took office as county executive in January, 2012, more than 16,000 new private sector jobs have been created in the Buffalo-Niagara Metropolitan Area, and the county's unemployment rate has dropped from 8.9% in January, 2012 to 4.7% as of December, 2015. Additionally, Poloncarz has stated the key to his administration’s success is to create strong partnerships with other levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, educational institutions and community groups. Examples include the creation of one of New York State’s first Land Banks, the establishment of the Erie County Medicaid Anti-Fraud Unit, as well as the successful negotiation of a new 10-year lease with the Buffalo Bills that is fair for local and state taxpayers and kept the team in Buffalo following the death of the team's owner Ralph Wilson Jr. At the time Poloncarz ran for county executive in 2011 he was the elected county comptroller in Erie County. Poloncarz was first elected comptroller in 2005 and was re-elected in 2009 in a three-person race by defeating Republican Phil Kadet and Independence Party candidate Michael Abramo by a 52 - 45 - 3 percentage point margin, respectively. Prior to being elected comptroller Poloncarz was an American business and finance lawyer residing in Buffalo, New York. Poloncarz was first elected county comptroller on a platform of restoring fiscal stability and accountability to the county by acting as the taxpayers \"watchdog.\" He is the first comptroller to be elected after a state control board was created and imposed over the county to oversee county finances. While he was the endorsed candidate of the county Democratic party, he defeated 2 challengers in the primary and then a Republican in the general election. Poloncarz has a bachelor's degree from the University at Buffalo and a law degree from the University of Toledo. Poloncarz was the 2003 - 2004 Buffalo and western New York coordinator and spokesman for the John Kerry presidential campaign. He was an at large district delegate for John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and to Hillary Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Poloncarz was the founder and first president of the WNY Coalition for Progress, a progressive think tank in upstate New York which today is known as the Western New York Democrats for Progress.",

Muhyiddin grew up in the state of Johor and joined the state public service after graduating from university. He later took up management positions at various state-owned companies. He joined politics in the 1970s and was elected as Member of Parliament for Pagoh in 1978. During his term as MP, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Federal Territories and later Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry. As Johor UMNO chief, he was Menteri Besar of Johor from 1986 to 1995. He returned to federal politics in 1995 and was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of Youth and Sports. He was appointed Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs after the 1999 general election and became a vice-president of UMNO in 2000. Under the premiership of Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Muhyiddin served as Minister of Agriculture (2004–2008) and then Minister of International Trade and Industry (2008–2009). In 2008, he contested and won the UMNO deputy presidency and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education by Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009. As Education Minister, Muhyiddin ended the use of English as the medium of instruction for science and mathematics in public schools. He also attracted controversy after describing himself as \"Malay first\" when challenged by the opposition to pronounce himself as \"Malaysian first.\" During Najib's mid-term Cabinet reshuffle in July 2015, he was dropped from his position, marking the first incumbent to be left out; in June 2016 he was further sacked from UMNO.",

From 1992 onward, Foley served as Attorney-General of Queensland and Minister for the Arts, among other roles, in the Wayne Goss Government. In opposition from 1996-1998, Foley was Shadow Attorney-General. When Labor won government under Peter Beattie in 1998, Foley was appointed Minister for the Arts, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. At the 2001 election, his seat was abolished and he successfully contested Yeerongpilly. Judge Roslyn Atkinson has credited Foley, in his role as Queensland Attorney-General, with making the Bench more inclusive and representative of wider society, and specifically appointing more women to the Bench.  After the election, he became Minister for Employment, Training and Youth, keeping his responsibility for the Arts but leaving his legal portfolios. Foley retired from politics in 2004.",

  "text" : "Michael \"Mickey\" Cafagna (July 26, 1943 - April 11, 2009) was the third elected mayor of the city of Poway, California, serving from 1998 until his death in 2009. Cafagna was born in Detroit, Michigan, the third son of Italian immigrants. He moved to Poway (then an unincorporated part of San Diego County) circa 1975; following a successful career as a real estate developer, he was appointed to the Poway City Council in 1992, eventually winning the mayoral election in November 1998. As Mayor, Cafagna represented Poway in the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), serving for a time as its chairman. His other contributions include the construction of Poway's city hall and of the South Poway Business Park on Scripps Poway Parkway, his efforts to fund much-needed improvements to freeways and transit systems, and his leadership during the Cedar and Witch Creek fires of 2003 and 2007, respectively. He was most known for his outgoing personality and his ability to make deals for the benefit of the city. His genial manner also aided him in public situations; Deputy Mayor Don Higginson recounted an incident at the 1998 World Series between the New York Yankees and the San Diego Padres where Cafagna - just before his election as Mayor - invited Higginson and about a hundred others to travel to New York for the first two games. During Game 1, the Poway contingent sat among the Yankee fans, who booed them and threw beer on them. While others got up and left, Cafagna remained and offered to buy the Yankee fans a beer. By the end of the game, they were applauding him; when the party returned for Game 2, the Yankee fans cheered him. Even his political opponents, such as Poway's first mayor Bob Emery, acknowledged that while they had been opposed to his philosophies at first (Cafagna was a real estate developer, while Emery advocated slow-growth policy), they began to see things from his point of view, just as he saw things from theirs, and they grew to respect his character and his genial attitude. Cafagna had in fact avoided doing his development business in Poway to avoid conflicts of interest, and as Mayor opposed helter-skelter sprawl throughout the region (often with the \"How much do we have to grow before we destroy the reasons we live here\" speech, as Emery termed it). In 2005, Cafagna was diagnosed with kidney cancer and underwent an operation to remove it. However, it returned nearly four years later, having spread to his lungs. His illness prevented him from conducting day-to-day city government, and as a result Deputy Mayor Higginson became acting mayor. Cafagna was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on March 5 from what was previously thought to be pneumonia, but later determined to be septic shock; he died there on April 11, at the age of 65. After services at St. Michael's Catholic Church, he was buried a week later at Dearborn Memorial Park in Poway. Cafagna was survived by his wife of 43 years, Sharon Green Cafagna, as well as their two children, Kevin and Stacy, and five grandchildren.",

  "text" : "Michael \"Mike\" Ertel (born November 29, 1969) is the Republican Supervisor of Elections of Seminole County, Florida, serving since he was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush in 2005. Ertel was born in Jacksonville, and grew up in Seminole County, attending Lake Howell High School and then later attending the University of Maryland University College. After high school, he joined the United States Army, where he served first in the Infantry and then as a public affairs representative, and took place in Army operations during the 1992 Los Angeles riots; during Operation Able Sentry, in which the United States established a base in Macedonia to monitor sanctions against Serbia; and in Bosnia during the Bosnian War. After completing his term in the Army, Ertel returned to Seminole County, where he continued his work in public affairs. In 1999, following a vacancy on the Oviedo City Council, Ertel applied for an appointment, but was ultimately not selected, in part due to concerns about a county employee being a city council member. Afterwards, he was contracted by Visit Florida, which was closely affiliated with the Florida Commission on Tourism, to work as their post-disaster public relations director. When Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Sandy Goard resigned from her office in January 2004, Dennis Joyner was appointed as her replacement. Ertel, along with fellow veteran Charles Gambaro, Jr., challenged Joyner in the Republican primary later that year. He criticized the incumbent for increased office spending, noting, \"When you spend beyond your means, then ask the county for more money, that tells me that the current administrator doesn't know how to budget,\" and declared that he would \"hold the line on the budget in his first year in office and then cut the budget in each of the succeeding three years.\" Ultimately, however, Ertel lost to Joyner in the primary. However, in 2005, following his election to the post, Joyner announced his resignation as Supervisor of Elections in a letter to then-Governor Jeb Bush, noting, \"My physicians have advised that I [resign] immediately,\" which was effective on January 10. Ertel, along with a number of other individuals, applied for the appointment to fill Joyner's position, and he was appointed by Governor Bush to serve a two-year term until the next general election. In 2006, Ertel ran for re-election, and was opposed by Democratic activist Marian Williams, who had run two years prior. He was endorsed by the Orlando Sentinel, which praised him for the fact that he \"has run elections well and has taken creative approaches to voter registration and streamlining of office operations.\" In the end, Ertel defeated Williams by a solid margin, winning 59% of the vote. In 2008 and 2012, Ertel was re-elected without opposition. In 2012, when Governor Rick Scott purged thousands of voters that he claimed to be non-citizens from the voter rolls, Ertel spoke out, asserting, \"It's frustrating that we're put in this situation that we are the ones having to contact our neighbors and say, 'Some other person's database says you may not be a citizen and we're the ones having to ask you if you are, even though we were the ones standing in the back of the room when we registered you to vote!'\" He noted that since there were so many instances in which the purged voters were actually legally eligible voters, \"[T]he list [of purged voters] should have been vetted quite a bit more before they were given to us.\" In 2013, Ertel received the International Electoral Ergonomy Award from the International Centre for Parliamentary Studies for his work as the Seminole County Supervisor of Elections; specifically, they praised him for the fact that the Voter Trust Plan he implemented increased voter confidence, increased turnout, and was \"exemplary for election management bodies worldwide.\"",

In 1852, he was nominated by the Whigs as a candidate for mayor of New York City, but lost to Jacob Aaron Westervelt. He retired from his business in 1857. In 1859, he moved to Stamford, Connecticut, where he built a residence. He lived in Connecticut for eight years, and during that time was a member of both the Connecticut House and Connecticut Senate.

She is the sister of former Member of Parliament John Nunziata. An accounting clerk, she became head of the Harwood Ratepayers Association. She was first elected to office in 1985 as school board trustee for the City of York School Board. In 1988 she was elected to the York city council ousting incumbent Gary Bloor. On city council she rose to prominence as a whistleblower in the Fairbank Park affair. A deal had been made to sell part of the city park to a developer to build condominiums. Nunziata leaked material to the press illustrating irregularities in the process, leading to a police investigation of several local politicians. The affair pitted Nunziata against almost the entire York city council in a bitter debate. Nunziata took fellow councillor Nicolo Fortunato to court after he reportedly called her a \"slut\" and threatened to kill her. In the 1991 elections Nunziata was vindicated as six of the eight sitting councillors lost their reelection bids while Nunziata defeated her nearest rival by a ten to one margin. Eventually two York city councillors, one Metro Toronto councillor, and the developer were jailed over the affair. In the 1994 election Nunziata chose to challenge York mayor Fergy Brown. Nunziata was considered unlikely to defeat the incumbent, but after a spirited and often bitter campaign she emerged victorious. As mayor she ran into her own ethics issues when it was alleged she had used city money to pay a political operative. As mayor her main cause was an unsuccessful campaign to construct a subway line under Eglinton avenue. With the creation of the megacity in 1997 she was elected to Toronto city council. On city council she mostly concerned herself with law and order issues. She also was a prominent defender of Kimberley Glasco in her battle with the National Ballet of Canada. In 2010, George Berger, an executive assistant who worked for her in 2005 brought her before a human rights tribunal claiming harassment and discrimination during his employment. Berger claims that he was targeted due to a disability. Nunziata denies the claim. Berger is asking for monetary compensation and an apology. On December 7, 2010 she was nominated by Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday and elected as Speaker of Toronto City Council.",

Halsey came from one of the most prominent families of Hertfordshire, whose seat was at Gaddesden Place, near Hemel Hempstead. He was the son of Thomas Plumer Halsey and his wife Frederica Johnston, daughter of General F. Johnston. His father was Member of Parliament (MP) for Hertfordshire from 1847 until he was drowned with his wife and his younger son in the shipwreck of the steamer Ercolano in the Gulf of Genoa on 24 April 1854.

After graduating in 1861, Halsey took up the life of a county notable in Hertfordshire, obtaining a commission in the North Hertfordshire Yeomanry and becoming a Justice of the Peace. He was chairman of the Gaddesden School Board. At the 1874 general election Halsey was elected Conservative MP for Hertfordshire and served in the post until 1885, when the constituencies were reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. the 1885 general election he was elected for Watford. He was also an alderman of Hertfordshire County Council from 1888, and was particularly interested in the Hertfordshire Constabulary. He served as deputy chairman of the St Albans Quarter Sessions from 1889 to 1908. In 1899 he was elected Chairman of the House of Commons Standing Orders Committee (and the added chairmanship of the Committee of Selection), and for service in this role was appointed to the Privy Council after the accession of King Edward VII on 24 January 1901, entitling him to the style \"The Right Honourable\". Halsey held his seat until 1906, when he lost to the Liberal candidate Nathaniel Micklem. After his parliamentary defeat he once more devoted himself to county affairs, serving as chairman of the St Albans Quarter Sessions from 1908 to 1918. No decision of his court was ever appealed. He finally retired from the Hertfordshire Yeomanry with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, having served as second-in-command, and then joined the county Territorial Force association, becoming its chairman. He was an active Freemason, and served as Deputy Grand Master of England and Second Grand Principal of the Supreme Grand Chapter of the Royal Arch from 1903. In December 1908, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Hertfordshire. He was created a baronet on 22 June 1920, in the 1920 Birthday Honours. Halsey lived at Gaddesden Place, Hemel Hempstead.

Upon his death, the Oakland City Council voted unanimously to rename City Hall Plaza in his honor as the Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. The plaza displays a bronze bust of Ogawa. A Nisei, Ogawa was born in Lodi, California and never lived in Japan. Nevertheless, as Japanese Americans, the U.S. government involuntarily relocated Ogawa's family members to the Topaz War Relocation Center in Millard County, Utah and they were detained there for the duration of World War II. Ogawa married Grace Ogawa (née Hiruma) prior to their wartime detention and they had two children—Alan and Nancy. Nancy was born in the Topaz War Relocation Center but died at age 2. After the war, Ogawa returned to Oakland where he found work as a gardener. Eventually, he borrowed and saved enough money to open his own nursery. When Ogawa died, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, in her Tribute to Frank H. Ogawa, said: \"Frank Ogawa was a remarkable person because he could take personal misfortune and turn it into a positive learning experience for himself and others. When Frank and Grace Ogawa were forced to sell their belongings and live in internment camps during World War II, they had to sleep on straw mattresses in horse stalls for six months before beingshipped to a camp in Utah to spend another 3 1/2 years in confinement. Despite this mistreatment and injustice, he never lost faith in the United States. Just the opposite--he strived to prove his loyalty to his country and became an internationally recognized champion of Asian-Americans in the process.\" She went on to say \"Having served five years on the Oakland Parks Commission, Frank Ogawa was elected to the city council in 1966, making him the first Japanese-American to hold a council seat in a major city in the continental United States. He held that position for 28 years until his passing -- the longest tenure in Oakland's history.\" Ogawa was a member of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) from 1972 to 1988, having been appointed to the Commission by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Ogawa served on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors from 1979 until 1992 when he had to retire from the Board because of health issues. He served as Chairman of the Board during most of 1987 and served as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board's Executive Committee and Personnel Committee. Ogawa was a Republican. However, he never held nor was he ever a candidate for any partisan office. As a public official, Ogawa was known as kind, optimistic, and adept at building consensus. In about December 1988, Ogawa underwent successful heart surgery. Ogawa died in Oakland on July 13, 1994, of lung cancer. He was survived by his wife Grace, son Alan, and by two grandchildren, Courtney and Matthew. More than 600 people, including a representative of Oakland's sister city of Fukuoka, Japan, attended Ogawa's memorial service.",

In 1983 in a dispute about the use of volunteers in the ambulance service, as minister for Health, he publicly sided with the St. John Council who managed the ambulance service and two unions, the Ambulance Employees Association and the Miscellaneous Workers Association. John Cornwall, reflects that this position probably damaged his credibility at the time, with both unions and the Labor Party. Blevins was Treasurer of South Australia from 1992 to 1993.

Brooks was nominated as the Reform Party candidate for the riding of Nepean—Carleton, but in March 1997 he resigned due to conflicts with the riding association before the election. Later that year he defeated Stewart to regain the mayoralty. Brooks was a strong opponent of the amalgamation of Rideau Township into the city of Ottawa, but once the new city was created he chose to run for the role of Rideau's representative to the city. The race again pitted Brooks against Stewart. Brooks won by a substantial margin and was reelected by approximately the same margin in the 2003 Ottawa election against Paul Paton. In the 2006 election Brooks was challenged by Scott Moffatt, but was reelected. In the 2010 election Moffat again challenged Brooks, and this time won by a substantial margin.",

Altobello first entered politics in 1985 when he was elected to the council of Scarborough to represent Ward 2, defeating more left-leaning candidate Barry Boyle. At 27, he was the youngest member on the council. He was re-elected with ease in 1988, but in 1991 he faced a fierce election battle against businessman Danny Lovatsis. Nevertheless, he was re-elected. He opposed the amalgamation of Scarborough, Toronto, and four other municipalities in 1997, but after it occurred he ran for a seat on Toronto city council in Ward 13. The ward structure at the time was such that the two candidates who received the most votes were elected in each riding. He was elected along with Brian Ashton. Fellow Scarborough city councillor Fred Johnson came in third. He has chaired the Planning and Transportation Committee. A centrist, he was aligned with the Liberal Party. On June 9, 2006, he was appointed a justice of the peace by the Attorney General of Ontario Michael Bryant, effective June 21, 2006. On June 14, 2006, he resigned as a councillor.",

This order was suspended, and the initial judgement was overturned on appeal. Mammoliti re-joined the executive committee in October 2013. Previously, Mammoliti served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1995. In 2002, he switched names from the anglicized George to the Italian Giorgio.

In July, after registering no more than 4% in public opinion polls over several months, Mammoliti withdrew from the mayoral contest in order to stand for re-election as a city councillor. On July 9, 2014, Toronto City Council suspended Mammoliti for three months for holding fundraisers contrary to the Council's code of conduct. On September 15, police have launched an investigation into the matter.",

Fitzgerald was born in Cochrane, Ontario. A lawyer by profession, Fitzgerald was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1960 provincial election representing Halifax Northwest for the Progressive Conservative and was re-elected in 1963. In 1967 he was elected in the new riding of Halifax Cobequid. In 1969, he was appointed Speaker and served until the 1970 provincial election in which the Conservative government was defeated and Fitzgerald lost his seat. Following his defeat, Fitzgerald returned to his legal practice and was one of the province's top trial lawyers in the 1970s. In 1978, he was convicted for falsifying tax return forms, and was disbarred by the Nova Scotia Bar Association for fraud. In 1980, he was convicted of raping a female client in his office and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He was paroled in 1981 after serving ten months of his sentence and was pardoned in 1992. In 1982, Fitzgerald was awarded a five-month $15,000 contract by the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission to study proposed changes to the Liquor Control Act. The appointment was met with outrage by the Opposition in the House of Assembly and he resigned the appointment. Fitzgerald attempted a political comeback in the 1993 provincial election and contested the Progressive Conservative nomination in Dartmouth South to run against Liberal leader John Savage. He won the nomination by a margin of 29 votes to 25 votes for his opponent, Dartmouth city councillor Colin May but Conservative Premier Donald Cameron refused to sign Fitzgerald's nomination papers due to Fitzgerald's rape conviction. May was awarded the nomination instead. Fitzgerald died on May 1, 2014 at a hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, aged 87.",

After unsuccessfully attempting to flee France, he was arrested by Philippe Petain's administration. Surrendered to German custody in 1942, he was imprisoned in Germany and later Austria until liberation in 1945. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946, he became a prominent figure again in French political life, serving in several cabinet positions. He favoured a United States of Europe, and participated in drafting the constitution for the Fifth Republic, but resigned from government in 1962 after disagreement with President de Gaulle over changes to the electoral system.",

  "text" : "Peter Ernest Hume (born June 19, 1963) was a city councillor in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He represented Alta Vista Ward in the south end of the city. He was considered by some to have been \"the most respected politician in Ottawa\". Hume grew up in the Canterbury area of Alta Vista Ward. He attended Hawthorne Public School and Canterbury High School before graduating with a degree in Economics from Carleton University. He would then work as an assistant to Canterbury Ward councillor Michael McSweeney and then Alta Vista Ward councillor Darrel Kent. Hume was first elected as a city and regional councillor in 1991. In 1994 he was elected to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton council (when it became an independently elected position). He was re-elected in 1997. In the 2000 Ottawa election, he chose to run against Ottawa city councillor Allan Higdon for city council, as the City of Ottawa and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton were set to amalgamate the following year. He was able to defeat Higdon, and was acclaimed three years later in the 2003 Ottawa election. In 2002, Hume contributed $362.26 to the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership campaign of Jim Flaherty. Hume is generally considered to be a \"red Tory\", who \"votes in favour of social spending, but talks convincingly about fiscal responsibility.\" In 2004, Hume allowed a private developer to hold a private party to raise money to pay off a debt Hume had received from running for President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Both Hume and the host of the party has refused to reveal the guest list to that event. Hume would later serve as President from 2008 to 2011. Hume was easily re-elected in the 2006 municipal elections with 70% of the vote and again in 2010 with 59% of the vote. Hume is currently the Chair of the City of Ottawa's Planning Committee, a position he has held since 2003. On August 22, 2014, Hume announced he would not be seeking re-election as councillor. In 2015, Hume partnered with former Minto vice-president, Jack Stirling, in a \"strategic partnership to pursue development projects and to advise both the private and public sector.\" Stirling, the old City of Nepean’s last planning commissioner before amalgamation, is well-known as another former local bureaucrat who jumped the fence in 2001 to work for Minto as vice-president of development, using his experience to stickhandle development proposals through the city’s Byzantine approvals process.",

  "text" : "Peter William Jenkins (born April 30, 1944) is a Canadian politician, who has served as deputy premier and health minister in the territorial government of the Yukon, and as mayor of Dawson City. Jenkins, a hotelier, first ran for the territorial legislature in 1989 but lost to NDP cabinet minister Art Webster. In that vote, Jenkins' campaign manager was future Liberal Premier Pat Duncan. Prior to entering provincial politics, he served as mayor of Dawson City from 1980 to 1994, earning the nickname \"Pirate Pete\" after he registered for satellite television service under the name of a dead local pioneer and then redistributed the television signals to residents of Dawson City for free. Jenkins was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1996 election in Klondike for the Yukon Party. He defended his seat in the 2000 election, the only Yukon Party member to do so. He assumed the leadership of the party after the election. He held the position as sole MLA and leader until May and June 2002, when Dennis Fentie crossed the floor from the NDP and won the leadership party's leadership, defeating Jenkins and former party president Darcy Tkachuk on the first ballot. He defended his seat successfully in the 2002 general election and was sworn into cabinet in November, serving as Health Minister and Deputy Premier until November 28, 2005 when he resigned from the party and cabinet. Jenkins said this was because \"the heart and soul of my community has been ripped out by the inefficiences of government at the municipal level, the territorial level.\" Fentie told the press at the time it was due to the ongoing loans file, which involved Jenkins owing $300,000 to the territorial government he was a part of. This eventually was cleared off the books in March 2006. Jenkins sat as an Independent MLA in the Assembly until dissolution, and chose not to run in the 2006 general election. Jenkins later ran for another term as mayor of Dawson City in the 2009 municipal election, defeating incumbent John Steins by seven votes. He was defeated in the 2012 municipal election by Wayne Potoroka.",

  "text" : "Alfred Deakin (3 August 1856 – 7 October 1919) was a leader of the movement for Australian federation and later the second Prime Minister of Australia. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including pro-worker industrial reforms. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia. It is likely that he could have been Premier of Victoria, but he chose to devote his energy to federation. Throughout the 1890s Deakin was a participant in conferences of representatives of the Australian colonies that were established to draft a constitution for the proposed federation. He played an important role in ensuring that the draft was liberal and democratic and in achieving compromises to enable its eventual success. Between conferences, he worked to popularise the concept of federation and campaigned for its acceptance in colonial referenda. He then fought hard to ensure acceptance of the proposed constitution by the Government of the United Kingdom. As Prime Minister, Deakin completed a significant legislative program that makes him, with Labor's Andrew Fisher, the founder of an effective Commonwealth government. He expanded the High Court, provided major funding for the purchase of ships, leading to the establishment of the Royal Australian Navy as a significant force under the Fisher government, and established Australian control of Papua. Confronted by the rising Australian Labor Party in 1909, he merged his Protectionist Party with Joseph Cook's Anti-Socialist Party to create the Commonwealth Liberal Party (known commonly as the Fusion), the main ancestor of the modern Liberal Party of Australia. The Deakin-led Liberal Party government lost to Fisher Labor at the 1910 election, which saw the first time a federal political party had been elected with a majority in either house in Federal Parliament. Deakin resigned from Parliament prior to the 1913 election, with Joseph Cook winning the Liberal Party leadership ballot.",

In 1988 she was elected to Metro Toronto Council (in the first election where Metro Councillors were directly elected). She served until Toronto was amalgamated into the megacity in 1997. That year, she was elected to the new Toronto City Council and served until 2003, when she was defeated by Karen Stintz. At the time of her defeat, she was the longest-serving and the oldest member of Toronto council. Johnston was also a candidate for Mayor of Toronto in 1978, when she lost to Fred Beavis in a deadlocked council vote for David Crombie's interim replacement; that vote literally came down to Beavis' name being drawn out of a hat. She campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1981 provincial election as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party, and lost to Progressive Conservative incumbent Larry Grossman in St. Andrew—St. Patrick by 3,835 votes. Johnston attempted to unseat Art Eggleton as mayor in the 1985 municipal election but was defeated 92,994 votes to 59,817. She returned to elected office in the 1988 when she was acclaimed as Metro Councillor for North Toronto. For most of her career, Johnston was known as a progressive voice on council. In her final term she supported a controversial condominium development at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton in 2002 adjacent to her ward. The North Toronto Tenants Network was so incensed by Johnston's move that they ran an advertisement in a local community paper, seeking applicants to contest Johnston's council seat. Stintz responded, and defeated Johnston in the 2003 municipal election by 2,321 votes. Johnston chaired the Toronto Seniors' Assembly and has been appointed as the group's Seniors' Advocate. The Anne Johnston Health Station in Toronto is named after her.",

  "text" : "Alexander Turk (March 5, 1906 – January 1, 1988) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1958. Born in Larne, Northern Ireland, the son of Nathaniel Turk and Mary O'Lynn, Turk came to Canada with his family in 1910, and was educated at Lord Selkirk School. In 1931, he married Annie Owens. He was a wrestling promoter and president of the Giants Baseball Club, and was known in politics as a charismatic showman. Some credit him with introducing modern professional wrestling to Manitoba in 1946 with his company, the NWA-affiliated Alex Turk Promotions. In later years, he would promote Verne Gagne, Pat O'Connor, Bruno Sammartino, Haystacks Calhoun, Lou Thesz and others in the region. He was eventually pushed out of business by competition from the American Wrestling Association. Turk's election to the Manitoba legislature was somewhat unexpected. In the 1953 election, he ran as a candidate of the Liberal-Progressive Party in Winnipeg North, a constituency dominated by the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the communist Labour Progressive Party. He finished seventh out of eleven candidates on the multi-member constituency's first count, behind two other Liberal-Progressive candidates. He did well on transfers, however, and defeated fellow Liberal-Progressive J.M. Kozoriz for the final position. In the legislature, he served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government. Turk was on the left-wing of the Liberal-Progressive Party. In 1954, he was the only member of the government caucus to support a CCF bill calling for comprehensive health insurance. The following year, he was the only Liberal-Progressive MLA to endorse a bill calling for progressive prison reforms. Winnipeg's multi-member constituencies were eliminated in the 1958 election, and Turk lost to Steve Peters of the CCF by 856 votes in the newly created riding of Elmwood. He ran again in the 1959 election, but finished third. After leaving provincial politics, Turk was elected to the Winnipeg City Council. Though a member of the conservative Civic Election Committee, he again showed himself to be a progressive representative on issues relating to workers, pensioners and the handicapped, and often voted with the CCF group. In 1964, he lost his seat on council to another CEC candidate.",

He was reeve of Nepean Township, Ontario from 1970 to 1978 and Regional Chair of Ottawa-Carleton from 1978-1991. Haydon was the first mayor of the city of Nepean when it incorporated on November 24, 1978; Ben Franklin assumed the title one week later. Born in Toronto, Haydon came to Ottawa when he was six. He attended Queen's University where he received a degree in chemical engineering. He then worked in Cornwall, Ontario as a professional engineer. He moved to Nepean Township in 1961 and in 1966 he was elected to Township council, after it was expanded to five aldermen from three. In 1969, he was elected reeve of Nepean. He defeated the incumbent reeve D. Aubrey Moodie in a landslide with 66% of the vote, thanks to the new subdivisions in the city unhappy with Moodie's tax increase. The Nepean Sportsplex and National Capital Equestrian Park were built during Haydon's term as reeve. In 1978 he became the regional chair of Ottawa-Carleton, where he served for 13 years, helping to introduce Ottawa's Transitway, Ottawa City Hall (then the Regional Offices), and the Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre. He failed however in his plans to establish a second Greenbelt in the city as well as his dreams of establishing Ottawa as a federal capital district. After retiring from politics, he ran a bed and breakfast with his wife. Andrew Haydon Park on the Ottawa River and Andrew Haydon Hall, the city council chambers at Ottawa City Hall, were named after him. Carleton University offers a scholarship in his name each year to a student in an engineering program. In September 2006, Haydon unexpectedly announced his candidacy in the new suburban ward of Gloucester-South Nepean, 15 years after his retirement from politics. He was defeated by Steve Desroches in the 2006 municipal elections. In September 2010, Haydon announced his candidacy for Mayor of Ottawa. He joins 19 other candidates for mayor in the Ottawa municipal election. Haydon has four children with his deceased wife, Mary Leishman. He is currently married to Sherry Franklin, the widow of Ben Franklin, Haydon's successor as mayor of Nepean.",

  "text" : "Aksel Larsen (August 5, 1897 – January 10, 1972) was a Danish politician who was chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark and chairman and founder of the Socialist People's Party. Larsen became leader of the Communist Party in 1932, and was elected to the Danish Parliament (Rigsdagen) in 1932. Together with other Danish communists, Larsen had to go into hiding in 1941 when the Danish police began arresting all party members. After the liberation of the Second World War Larsen became a minister in the interim government, and subsequently led his party to its best-ever result in the October 1945 election, in which it took 10% of the vote. The election however, resulted in a Liberal government, and Larsen's party was mostly shunned by the other party leaders. Following the rising in Hungary in 1956, Larsen condemned the Soviet Union's action. This led him into conflict with the members of the party leadership who had a greater loyalty to Moscow; a conflict that ended with his expulsion in November 1958. Larsen's reaction was to establish the Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), which, thanks to Larsen's personal popularity, entered parliament at the 1960 election at the expense of the Communists, who from then on played only a very peripheral role in Danish politics. Aksel Larsen -- who was especially in later years highly respected among politicians, even if his party was seen as somewhat irresponsible -- remained as leader of the Socialists until 1968, when he handed over to Sigurd Ømann. He remained an MP until his death in 1972. In 2005, the Danish Institute for International Studies concluded that Larsen held a secret working relationship between 1958 and 1964 with one of Denmark's allied partners in the Cold War, stating that \"Larsen... obviously was an agent of a Western intelligence service.\"",

Being a member of the Malaysian Parliament for 38 years, Taib is also the second longest-serving parliamentarian in Malaysia after Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Taib and his wider family are regularly accused of corruption and personally benefiting from Sarawak's natural and economic resources. On 12 February 2014, Taib handed over his resignation letter to the Governor of Sarawak to vacate his chief minister post, officially ending his 33 years of chief ministership. His former brother-in-law, Adenan Satem, succeeded him as Chief Minister with effect from 1 March 2014. At the same time, he received the official credentials as the 7th Sarawak Head of State from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at Istana Negara on 28 February, and officially took the oath of office on the following day.

  "text" : "Alison Nampitjinpa Anderson (born 1958) is an Australian politician. She was member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2005 to 2016, representing the electorate of Namatijra (known as MacDonnell until 2012). Currently an independent, she has previously served as a minister for both the Australian Labor Party and Country Liberal Party and been territory leader of the Palmer United Party. Anderson entered the Northern Territory Assembly as a star candidate for the Australian Labor Party at the 2005 election. She was re-elected unopposed as the Member for MacDonnell in the August 2008 Territory election and with the subsequent return of the Henderson Labor Government was appointed to Cabinet. She held the positions of Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage; Minister for Parks and Wildlife; Minister for Arts and Museums; and Minister for Indigenous Policy. She left the Cabinet and the Labor Party in 2009 after a dispute over indigenous housing, and sat as an independent for two years. She then joined the opposition Country Liberal Party in 2011 and was elected as a Country Liberal candidate at the 2012 election. She resigned from the CLP in 2014, along with two other indigenous MPs, briefly becoming an independent once again. However, on 27 April 2014 it was announced that the three MLAs had joined the Palmer United Party, with Anderson serving as parliamentary leader. She resigned from Palmer United to sit as an independent on 29 November 2014. It was briefly rumoured that she was returning to the CLP amid the 2015 CLP leadership spill, but she remained an independent. Anderson speaks six indigenous languages: Anmatyerre, Luritja, Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Western Arrernte and Yankunytjatjara. She is also an accomplished artist. She is among Australia's most senior indigenous politicians, and has been a prominent indigenous activist, including as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Central Zone Commissioner (see: List of Indigenous Australian politicians). Her partner is Nicolas Rothwell, journalist with The Australian. Anderson retired at the 2016 Territory election.",

  "text" : "Allan Ernest Pietz (born 18 June 1925 in Welland, Ontario) is a former Progressive Conservative party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was a businessman and dairy operator by career. He held a series of elected municipal offices in the former Crowland Township before he was elected mayor of Welland in 1965. He held office until 1978, when he did not run for re-election for mayor. He was succeeded by Eugene Stranges. In 1981, he was elected as a Niagara Regional Councillor from Welland. While holding office, he was the morning radio farm reporter for the local radio station CHOW-AM. After several unsuccessful attempts to enter national politics at the Welland riding in the 1958, 1962 and 1979 federal elections, he won the riding in the 1984 federal election, defeating Liberal incumbent Gilbert Parent. Pietz only served one term, during the 33rd Canadian Parliament, as he was defeated in the 1988 federal election at the reorganized Welland—St. Catharines—Thorold riding by Parent. He made a political comeback in 1991 when he was again elected as a Niagara Regional Councillor for Welland. Shortly afterward, he ran for the Chairmanship of the Niagara Regional Council, but was defeated by Brian Merritt. He did not seek re-election in 1994 and has since retired from political life.",

  "text" : "Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee (1901–1986) (Bengali: অজয় মুখোপাধ্যায়) was the fourth chief minister of West Bengal, India. He hailed from Tamluk, Purba Medinipur district, West Bengal. Born in 1901, he was one of the leaders of Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar (Tamrlipta National Government), which came into effect on 17 December 1942 during the Quit India Movement, a programme of civil disobedience launched in India in 1942. He was greatly influenced by Swami Vivekananda. Earlier a member of the Indian National Congress, he later became a leader in the Bangla Congress, which co-governed with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in two United Front governments in the 1960s and 1970s. He held the chief ministerial position in both these governments, from March to November 1967, and again from February 1969 to March 1970.In the year 1967 Ajoy Mukherjee defeated Prafulla Chandra Sen another Gandhian at Arambagh assembly constituency and became chief minister of West Bengal after Prafulla Chandra Sen. Architect of Ajoy Mukherjee's victory at Arambagh was Narayan Ch Ghosh the then students leader at arambagh. Narayan Ghosh accompanied Ajoy Mukherjee in a boat for several days to see sever flood effected areas in Arambagh & Ghatal subdivision during 1968. People of flood affected areas were enthused by Ajoy Mukherjee for his untired move to stand for them. Ajoy Mukherjee with some of his closed colleagues, viz. Pranob Mukherjee etc., joined Indian National Congress leaving Sushil Dhara- his long term associates. He was offered ministerial post at Centre by Indira Gandhi, but Ajoy Mukherjee saying his age and health condition had pushed Pranab Mukherjee. Pranab Mukherjee became State Minister in the Indian Cabinet. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award in 1977 from Government of India. His brother Biswanath Mukherjee was the husband of Geeta Mukherjee, a communist MP. Ajoy's niece Kalyani (daughter of another brother) was married to Mohan Kumaramangalam and was the mother of Rangarajan Kumaramangalam and Lalitha Kumaramangalam. Mukherjee died on May 27, 1986 in Calcutta.",

He did his secondary schooling at the Royal College of Curepipe. Called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1978, Ajay Daby studied in the United Kingdom and is a member of The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, London. He is married to Geeta Prayag, a laureate of the Queen Elizabeth College and doctor from the Sheffield University. Daby started his legal career as a private legal practitioner before joining the State Law Office as State Prosecutor, but only for a very brief period. He soon resigned from his post in the Judiciary to join politics. Elected MP of the PSM in 1982 in Flacq-Bon Acceuil, Constituency No 9 at the age of 26, he became the youngest MP in the country. He was further elected as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Mauritius. In 1983, he was one of the founder members of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). He was in the same year, re-elected MP of Flacq-Bon Acceuil under the banner of the newly created MSM and went on to become the youngest Speaker of the Commonwealth and Association des Parlementaires de Langue Francaise (AIPLF). He was re-elected in Constituency No 11 (Rose-Belle/Vieux Grand Port) and was called upon to take the post of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly yet again. In 1990, on a question of principle, Mr Daby refused to give the casting vote much needed by the then government to change the status of Mauritius to that of a republic and sever ties with the British Crown. He voiced his dissent with his leader and party on this question. The MSM - MMM newly formed coalition not having the required three-quarters majority to expel Mr Daby from his Speakership, went ahead to amend the Constitution to enable the removal of the Speaker by a simple majority. On 5 December 1990, the Constitution of Mauritius was amended accordingly. Mr Daby then joined the Mauritius Labour Party, but for a brief spell only. In 2001, Mr Daby was made Commissionner for Drug Assets Forfeiture under the Government led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth ,and later by Paul Berenger, until 2005, when there was a change of Government following general elections . Daby is back at the Bar and is regularly seen in high profile cases.",

In addition to being a member of the National Negro Committee, the precursor to the NAACP, Pillsbury was a member of the Boston Committee to Advance the Cause of the Negro, which in 1911 became a branch of the NAACP. It was Pillsbury who drafted the bylaws of the NAACP. In 1913, he resigned his membership in the American Bar Association when that organization rejected the membership of William H. Lewis, a black assistant U.S. attorney and supporter of Booker T. Washington. In 1913, Pillsbury was awarded an honorary LL.D. degree from Howard University.

In 2001, Brolly was elected as a councillor to Limavady Borough Council for the electoral area of Benbradagh. She topped the first preference votes with 1056, and her husband came in second with 917. He was also elected to the Council. The quota was 840. In 2003, Brolly took over from George Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as the Mayor of Limavady. At Christmas 2003 she was asked to switch on the Christmas tree lights for Burnfoot. There was a small Loyalist protest during the switching-on of the lights because of the election of a Sinn Féin mayor. Afterwards, the tree was cut down by vandals and the lights smashed. On 14 June 2004 Councillor Brolly stood down as Mayor. In October 2004, the High Court of Northern Ireland ordered the government to provide the Brolly couple with protection, following reports of threats from the Red Hand Defenders, a Loyalist paramilitary group. In 2005, she was re-elected to the Council, but this time for the Limavady Town electoral area. She garnered 657 first preference votes, a total of 17.6% of the vote. She was the only Sinn Féin councillor elected in that area, coming third behind George Robinson and Alan Robinson both of the DUP. In January 2008, Brolly and another councillor were confronted by a crowd in an \"extremely nasty mood\" outside the council's offices. Police were called.",

  "text" : "Alfred George Reynolds was an Australian politician. He was the Labor member for Forrest in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1947 to 1950. Born in Milton, Queensland in 1894, Reynolds joined the Australian Imperial Forces at the outbreak of World War I with the Service number 62. He joined the 3rd Field Ambulance of the 1st Australian Division and served as a stretcher bearer and batman throughout the War, landing at Gallipoli from the HMS Ribble before dawn on 25 April 1915 and through the Western Front battles of Fromelles, Mouquet Farm, Ypres, Menin Road and the German counter attacks of Operation Michael and Operation Georgette and finishing with the Battle of Épehy. He arrived back in Sydney on 5 December 1918. On his return he married Monica McKenna, the youngest daughter of John McKenna the Commissioner of the Western Australia Police  and took up soldier settlement land at Mukinbudin. They had six children. Monica died on 4 July 1932 and Reynolds in the same year married Elizabeth Barnett, the local schoolteacher. They had a further two children. Reynolds lost the farm as a result of the Great Depression and moved to York, Western Australia, working as a farm manager and accountant. After his experiences in the War, he maintained an interest in politics, standing in turn for the Federal Division of Swan as an Independent Country Party candidate, the State Electoral district of Forrest (successfully) and the State Electoral district of South Perth for the Australian Labor Party. He died in 1976. One of his grandchildren is Linda Reynolds, Senator for the State of Western Australia.",

  "text" : "Alex M. Torpey (born August 10, 1987 in New York City) is a non-party affiliated American politician and consultant. Torpey was elected as the 48th Village President (equivalent of mayor) of South Orange, New Jersey in May 2011 for a four-year term by a 14-vote margin. At the age of 23 years at the time of being sworn in (May 16, 2011), he was the youngest Village President in South Orange’s history, and at that time the youngest serving mayor in the state of New Jersey. Torpey was one of the youngest mayors in the United States to oversee a municipality the size of South Orange, which has 16,000 full-time residents plus approximately 7,000 Seton Hall University students at their South Orange campus. On June 20, 2014, nearly 1 year before his first term was over, he announced he would not seek re-election to a second term. Torpey's term ended May 18 when he swore-in South Orange's second-youngest, and first female, Village President, Sheena Collum, whom he supported in the election, and had served with for two previous years on South Orange's governing body. Torpey was born in New York City, and raised first in Maplewood, then South Orange, and is an alumnus of Columbia High School (2005). Torpey completed his undergraduate degree in Political Science, American Government and Law at Hampshire College, while also serving as student government president. He also holds a Master of Public Administration in emergency management from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. Torpey founded is a managing partner of Veracity Media LLC, a social-impact consulting firm. Torpey also founded a nonpartisan initiative, Rethink Leadership, to help encourage young people to consider elected office and local government as a way to become more involved and active in their government and public policy issues. Torpey was named a 2013-2014 James Madison Fellow at the bi-partisan Millennial Action Project for his work in encouraging young people towards civics participation. Torpey also serves on the advisory board of the New Jersey chapter of the New Leaders Council and on Sustainable Jersey's Community Information and Citizen Engagement Initiative. Starting in the fall semester of 2014, Torpey was appointed adjunct faculty of governance and technology at Seton Hall University, co-teaching with Dr. Matt Hale, master of public administration students on topics of collaboration and technology innovation in government. Torpey’s philosophy of governance relies heavily on the use of technology, media and communications to increase interactivity, transparency and efficiency towards the ends of better government. He has written and lectured on these topics frequently prior to his election and since. While in office, Torpey primarily worked on a number of fiscal, economic development, public safety, transparency, community engagement and organizational development initiatives, in addition to petitioning utility companies for better preparedness efforts after Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy; along with several other New Jersey mayors, performing one of the first legal same-sex marriages in the state in 2013 (as well as being a vocal advocate on the issue); advocating for better open data standards, a tuition-credit program for volunteer first responders and updates to homelessness and veterans support programs. In addition to his official municipal responsibilities as Village President, Torpey served as a member and EMT of the South Orange Rescue Squad. Torpey also served as South Orange's municipal Office of Emergency Management Coordinator.",

He was a Member of Parliament from 1960 to 1991, being elected as a candidate of the left wing AKEL party. He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) from 1943 to 1986. His contribution to the development of labour relations and labour legislation in Cyprus has been crucial and many consider him the person with the most significant role in shaping the trade union movement on the island. Legislations such as the Social Security Law of Cyprus in 1956 (Πρώτος Νόμος Περί Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων, Νόμος Αρ. 31 του 1956), the introduction of the Cost of Living Allowance, the eight-hour working day and the forty hour working week, legislation on unfair dismissal and the labour disputes tribunals, the shaping of the collective agreements in many sectors of economic activity as well as the tripartite cooperation between trade unions, employers’ organisations and government all bear his mark. He first joined the outlawed Communist Party of Cyprus in 1939 and became a member of left wing AKEL party in 1941 upon its foundation.He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Trade Union Committee, the first coordinating body of trade unions in Cyprus and the precursor of PEO. He was accused along with all the Committee members for sedition and insurrection against the Colonial order and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in 1946. This was a major political trial of the colonial era and his address to the court was a memorable anti-colonial statement. Andreas Ziartides participated as the Cypriot representative in the founding congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) held in 1945 in London. He served on the General Council and the Executive Committee of the WFTU for many years and was its Vice President for a while. In the early nineties he, along with others in the AKEL leadership, disagreed with the line followed by the Party and was dismissed from his leadership position. This led to his and others’ departure from AKEL and the formation of ADESOK, in Greek: ΑΔΗΣΟΚ (Ανανεωτικό Δημοκρατικό Σοσιαλιστικό Κόμμα), a reformist leftist party. ADESOK was later merged with Free Democrats Movement (founded by former President of Cyprus George Vassiliou) and formed a new party named United Democrats. A form of interview/biography of Andreas Ziartides was authored by Panikos Paionides in his book \"Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης: Χωρίς φόβο και πάθος\" Television interviews of Andreas Ziartides were documented by journalist Pavlos Pavlou (Greek: Παύλος Παύλου) in his book Dimosia Katathesi (Greek: Δημόσια Κατάθεση).",

  "text" : "Joseph Alfred (Fred) Laberge (February 16, 1893 - March 27, 1964) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario in 1920 and 1921. Laberge was the son of Jean-Baptiste Laberge, who founded the Laberge Lumber Company and constructed many of the earliest buildings in Sudbury. He later took over management of the company from his father. Elected mayor in 1920, Laberge was at 27 years old the youngest mayor ever elected in Sudbury at that point. He was also the first mayor to have been born in Sudbury, and the first francophone to hold the mayoralty since Francis Lemieux in 1903. His election marked at least a temporary end to linguistic tensions between the city's anglophone and francophone communities initiated by the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and ironically occurred just one year after the first municipal election in the city's history in which francophone candidates had failed to win a single seat on council. Following his term as mayor, Laberge ran for the Conservative nomination in Nipissing in the 1925 federal election, but was subjected to a blackmail attempt by Elzéar Cousineau, who wrote him an anonymous letter demanding a $2,000 payout. Laberge turned the letter over to the police, and on their advice left a dummy package in Cousineau's requested location, and Cousineau was arrested when he arrived to retrieve the package. Despite Cousineau's arrest, however, Laberge withdrew from the nomination race in favour of John Ferguson. Ferguson failed on election day to defeat incumbent MP Edmond Lapierre; Laberge was selected as the party's candidate in the subsequent 1926 election, but also lost to Lapierre. After his retirement from the lumber business, Laberge moved to Montreal, Quebec, and died at his home in Westmount on March 27, 1964.",
