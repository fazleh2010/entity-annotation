  "text" : "Glenn Patrick Lazarus (born 11 December 1965) is a former Australian Senator and former professional rugby league footballer. An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative prop forward, Lazarus won premierships with the Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos and Melbourne Storm, whom he also captained. After his retirement from football he was elected to the Australian Senate at the 2013 federal election as the lead Queensland candidate for the Palmer United Party (PUP). He became PUP Senate leader at the commencement of his term on 1 July 2014. He quit PUP on 13 March 2015 and became an Independent as a reaction to his wife being sacked from the Palmer United Party on the same day. He did not retain his seat in the July 2016 election receiving just 1.7% of the primary senate vote in Queensland.",
