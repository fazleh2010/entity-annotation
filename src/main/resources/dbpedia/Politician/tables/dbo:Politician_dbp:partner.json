He was appointed Director of the Higher Education office in October 2011 by Governor of Minnesota Mark Dayton. Pogemiller is known for his outspoken, assertive leadership style and his strategic thinking. Reporter Tom Scheck of Minnesota Public Radio called him \"a brilliant and combative political tactician who often speaks his mind\". Former Minnesota House Speaker Steve Sviggum called him \"a very frustrating individual as he runs the clock past midnight all the time.\" Pogemiller had a rocky relationship with former Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty.",

He was a Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2006, representing Central Highlands Province. He stood unsuccessfully for the province as the Labor candidate at 1999 Victorian state election, before winning it at his next attempt at the 2002 state election. The province was abolished in 2006 with the reform of the Legislative Council. Mitchell stood unsuccessfully as the Labor candidate for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Benalla at the 2006 state election. At the 2007 federal election, Mitchell was the Labor candidate for the seat of McEwen, a hybrid urban-rural seat encompassing Labor-friendly territory in north Melbourne and more conservative rural areas to the north of the capital. He had initially been announced as the winning candidate, defeating the sitting Liberal member Fran Bailey by a mere seven votes. However, after a recount this margin was reduced to five. A subsequent recount requested by the Liberal Party, overturned this result with Mitchell instead losing by 12 votes. The Court of Disputed Returns later increased this margin to 27 votes on the basis of handwriting skills. Mitchell won McEwen following Bailey's retirement at the 2010 federal election. Mitchell's win was one of only two gains for Labor at the election. Ahead of the 2013 federal election, McEwen was pushed further into Melbourne, technically making McEwen a safe Labor seat. However, Mitchell suffered a nine-point swing against former Liberal MLC Donna Petrovich, ultimately picking up enough postal votes to narrowly retain his seat on preferences.",

Bacon was elected at the Tasmanian state election, 2010, securing 10.3% of first preferences. The Labor ticket for Denison included three sitting Labor MPs (including the Premier, David Bartlett) but only Bartlett and Bacon were elected, with two sitting members Lisa Singh and Graeme Sturges losing their seats. In May 2011, Bacon was made a member of Cabinet following Bartlett's resignation, holding the portfolios of Tourism, Hospitality and Veteran's Affairs. After the Giddings government was defeated in 2014 state election, Bacon was given the role of Shadow Treasurer by new Opposition Leader Bryan Green.",

  "text" : "Sarah Brown is a transgender activist and Liberal Democrat politician. She was the Cambridge City Councillor for Petersfield ward between 2010 and 2014, serving as Executive Councillor for Community Wellbeing since 2013 and currently also serves as a member of the LGBT+ Liberal Democrats executive. She is a trans woman and, for several years, was the only openly transsexual elected politician in the UK. In 2011, she appeared on the Independent on Sunday \"Pink List\" as the 28th most influential LGBT person in the UK, dropping to 34th in the 2012 list, but rising again to 27th in the 2013 list. Brown is an advocate for equal marriage, and has several times discussed marriage laws as they affected her; her 2001 marriage to her wife Sylvia Knight was annulled upon gaining a Gender Recognition Certificate in 2009, and she described her subsequent civil partnership to Knight as a \"kick in the teeth\". Her case was cited during the report stage of the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill, when her MP Julian Huppert moved a series of amendments, which included a set intended to allow couples who dissolved their marriages under the Gender Recognition Act to retroactively restore their marriage. Brown also advocates for improved provisions for transgender people under the National Health Service, and created the \"#transdocfail\" hashtag on Twitter and collated several thousand tweets talking about abuse of transgender patients that she alleges exposed \"institutional transphobia\" in the medical profession that \"would be on the national news\" if it \"was happening to any other minority\". Brown is currently in a polyamorous relationship with Knight and fellow Liberal Democrat and transgender activist Zoe O'Connell, although none of them describe themselves as \"poly evangelists\". All three partners contributed to a Guardian column discussing polyamory in the context of transition and Brown's previous marriage, which was later cited by Huppert during the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill debate. She is currently a trustee of Cambridgeshire LGBT charities Encompass Network and SexYOUality",
