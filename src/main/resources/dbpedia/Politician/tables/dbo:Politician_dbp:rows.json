  "text" : "Erich Honecker (German: [ˈeːʁɪç ˈhɔnɛkɐ]; 25 August 1912 – 29 May 1994) was a German politician who, as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, led the German Democratic Republic from 1971 until the weeks preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. From 1976 onward he was also the country's official head of state as chairman of the State Council following Willi Stoph's relinquishment of the post. Honecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned during the Nazi era. Following World War II, he was freed and soon relaunched his political activities, founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955. As the Security Secretary of the Party’s Central Committee in the new East German state, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore responsibility for the \"order to fire\" along the Inner German border. In 1971, he initiated a political power struggle that led, with Soviet support, to his replacing Walter Ulbricht as First Secretary of the Central Committee and as chairman of the state's National Defense Council. Under his command, the country adopted a programme of \"consumer socialism\" and moved toward the international community by normalising relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN, in what is considered one of his greatest political successes. As Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s under the liberalising reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system and was consequently forced to resign by his party in October 1989 as the Communist regime sought to retain its power. Honecker's eighteen years at the helm of the soon-to-collapse German Democratic Republic came to an end. Following German reunification, he escaped to the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991 but was extradited back to Germany a year later to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuses committed by the East German regime. However, the proceedings were abandoned due to illness and he was freed from custody to travel to join his family in exile in Chile, where he died in May 1994 from liver cancer.",

He resigned as leader after his second election defeat, and was replaced by his former deputy, Jeff Seeney. However, after only 16 months as leader and facing poor opinion polling against Seeney, Springborg replaced him. Following this defeat Springborg played a leading role in the creation of the Liberal National Party (LNP), becoming the party's first leader but resigning after he led it to defeat at the 2009 Queensland election. John-Paul Langbroek was elected as his successor, with Springborg elected as Deputy Leader. Following a move by the LNP organisation to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney respectively. The Newman-led LNP overwhelmingly won the 2012 election and Springborg became Minister for Health in the Newman Cabinet. After the 2015 election, Newman lost his electorate of Ashgrove and Springborg was once again elected leader of the LNP, with Langbroek serving as his deputy as the LNP returned to opposition after one term in office. On 6 May 2016, Springborg lost the leadership of the LNP to Tim Nicholls.",

  "text" : "Craig Anthony Washington (born October 12, 1941) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Texas who served in the Texas State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. The son of Roy and Azalia Washington, Washington graduated from Prairie View A&M University in 1966 and was originally interested in becoming a doctor, but as admissions to medical school had already ceased, Washington decided to instead apply at Texas Southern University's law school. In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. \"Mickey\" Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the \"People's Five\"), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989. Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district. In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and still holds the seat today. Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas. On New Year's Day 2008, Washington shot at a car containing two teenagers. After being indicted by a grand jury in 2009, he agreed to two years of probation. However, Washington's attorney subsequently claimed that Washington fired because his life was in danger. Washington has since countersued the teenagers, alleging assault and property damage. The Internal Revenue Service has also sued Washington, alleging that he owes $610,000 in unpaid taxes. On January 8, 2015, Washington received a suspension of his Texas attorney's license. The 335th District Court of Bastrop County, Texas found that Washington had violated various rules, including the rules prohibiting neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him and failing to keep a client reasonably informed. On March 12, 2015, a \"modified judgment was entered imposing a four-year partially probated suspension with 12 months active.\" He was also ordered to pay over $24,600 in legal fees and expenses. Washington filed an appeal.",

Innerhalb der Partei führte er von 2005 bis 2012 die Ibuki-Faktion (offiziell: Shisuikai). Ibuki studierte bis 1960 Wirtschaftswissenschaften an der Universität Kyōto. Anschließend war er Beamter im Finanzministerium. 1983 wurde er erstmals im 1. Wahlkreis der Präfektur Kyōto ins Unterhaus gewählt und seither sieben Mal bestätigt. Von September 1997 bis Juli 1998 war er Arbeitsminister im Kabinett von Ryūtarō Hashimoto. Unter Premierminister Yoshirō Mori war er zwischen 2000 und 2001 Vorsitzender der Nationalen Kommission für öffentliche Sicherheit und Staatsminister für Katastrophenschutz. Von 2006 bis 2007 war Ibuki Bildungsminister im Kabinett von Shinzō Abe. Kurz nach seinem Amtsantritt hatte er sich dagegen ausgesprochen, Englisch als Fremdsprache verpflichtend in die Lehrpläne japanischer Grundschulen aufzunehmen: „Es gibt keinen Grund Englisch zu lernen, solange die Kinder nicht schönes Japanisch sprechen“. Nach Abes Rücktritt wurde er unter dem Parteivorsitzenden Yasuo Fukuda, den seine Faktion bei der Wahl gegen Tarō Asō unterstützt hatte, Generalsekretär der LDP. Bei der Kabinettsumbildung am 1. August 2008 ernannte Fukuda Ibuki zum Finanzminister, Nachfolger als Generalsekretär wurde Tarō Asō. Als dieser einen Monat später zum Parteivorsitzenden und Premierminister gewählt wurde, ersetzte er Ibuki durch Shōichi Nakagawa. Im neuen Kabinett war Ibukis Einfluss gewachsen: die Ibuki-Faktion war dort mit drei Ministern vertreten. Bei der für die LDP verheerenden Unterhauswahl 2009 verlor Ibuki seinen Wahlkreis an den Demokraten Tomoyuki Taira, wurde aber über den Verhältniswahlblock Kinki wiedergewählt. Bei der Unterhauswahl 2012 erhielt Ibuki weniger Stimmen als 2009, konnte seinen Wahlkreis mit weniger als einem Drittel der Stimmen aber in einem zersplitterten Kandidatenfeld zurückgewinnen. Anschließend wurde er zum Präsidenten des Unterhauses gewählt. Den Vorsitz der bisherigen Ibuki-Faktion übernahm Toshihiro Nikai. Ibuki ist, wie Premier Abe und weitere Kabinett- und LDP-Parteimitglieder, Mitglied der als revisionistisch geltenden Nippon Kaigi. Ibukis Ehefrau Yūko ist eine Enkelin von Takahashi Ryūtarō, dem Eigentümer des Baseball-Teams Takahashi Unions, Vorsitzenden des japanischen Fußballverbandes, Ryokufūkai-Oberhausabgeordneten und Ministers für Internationalen Handel und Industrie der Nachkriegszeit.",

  "text" : "Robert Cunningham Bruce (1843 – 23 April 1917) was a Scottish-born sailor, New Zealand politician and conservationist. Born in East Lothian, Scotland, Bruce's family moved to County Cork, Ireland, when he was seven years of age. He became an apprentice sailor at 13, leaving London on an East Indiaman. He eventually arrived in New Zealand on the Blue Jacket in 1860. After working in the goldfields of New Zealand and Queensland, he went to the United States where he remained for several years. In 1877 he returned to New Zealand, buying land in Paraekaretu in the Manawatu region. Bruce was an independent conservative Member of Parliament in the Manawatu region of New Zealand. He represented the Rangitikei electorate from 1884 to 1890. He contested the 1890 election in the Waitotara electorate, but was beaten by the incumbent, George Hutchison. The Rangitiki electorate, meanwhile, was won by Douglas Hastings Macarthur in 1890, but Macarthur died on 24 May 1892. The resulting 1892 by-election was won by Bruce. He served until the end of the parliamentary term in 1893 when he retired. He was one of three candidates to contest the new Manawatu electorate in the 1896 election, but he was narrowly beaten by John Stevens. He challenged Stevens again in the 1899 election but was again defeated. Bruce was a notable pioneer of the Manawatu District, who preserved several native forest remnants, including Bruce Park Scenic Reserve. Late in his life, he wrote a book about his experiences at sea. He died at his homestead Carrick in the Wanganui suburb of St. Johns Hill on 23 April 1917.",

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice and Howden, Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, having previously been Minister of State at the Foreign Office from July 1994 to April 1997. Davis was raised on Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, South West London. After attending Bec Grammar School in Tooting, London, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with Tate & Lyle. Entering Parliament in 1987 at the age of 38 for the Boothferry constituency, in his subsequent political career he held the positions of Conservative party chairman and Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the shadow cabinet, under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and then second. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary. This was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP in June 2008, he officially became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won it in July 2008. In 2010, Davis was invited by Prime Minister David Cameron to join the cabinet of his coalition government, but he declined and stayed on the backbenches. In July 2016, following the UK voting to leave the European Union, Davis was appointed by Theresa May as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.",

  "text" : "Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky's Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems. Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia's Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title \"the players' commissioner\". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951. Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor.",

Following Coe's retirement from athletics, he was a member of parliament for the Conservative Party from 1992 to 1997 for Falmouth and Camborne in Cornwall, and became a Life Peer on 16 May 2000.He headed the successful London bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and became chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games.

In August 2015 he was elected president of the IAAF. In 2012, Coe was appointed Pro-Chancellor at Loughborough University where he had been an undergraduate, and is also a member of the University's governing body. In November 2012 he was appointed chairman of the British Olympic Association. In 2012 he was one of 24 athletes inducted as inaugural members of the IAAF Hall of Fame.

Born in Tabulum in Northern New South Wales, Bruxner was educated at The Armidale School and started studies at University of Sydney but later dropped out to take up employment as a grazier and station agent in Tenterfield. After serving in the Citizen Military Forces from 1911, Bruxner enlisted into the Australian Light Horse upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Serving with distinction in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Returning to Australia in 1919, Bruxner sold his business and joined the Progressive Party, being elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for Northern Tablelands at the 1920 election. Bruxner came to political prominence when he led the rural \"True Blues\" faction of the Progressive Party that went against their Leader's decision to form a coalition in Sir George Fuller's short-lived government in 1921. Bruxner emerged as the leader of the reduced Progressive Party, which consisted of the members of his faction, but they nevertheless joined with Fuller's Nationalists to form government in 1922. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement. Bruxner resigned the party leadership, now for the renamed Country Party, at the end of 1925. At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England. Bruxner was central in ensuring Alexander Mair became Premier after Stevens was defeated in the house in August 1939. The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party of Australia. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962 and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970.",

Die DA konnte unter seiner Führung ein Ergebnis von rund 35 % (+ 7 Prozentpunkte) der Stimmen erzielen. Das gute Abschneiden seiner Partei brachte Maimane schlagartig nationale politische Aufmerksamkeit ein. Nach der Kommunalwahl übernahm er das Amt des Fraktionsvorsitzenden und Oppositionsführers im Stadtrat der City of Johannesburg. 2012 wurde Maimane zum stellvertretenden Parteivorsitzenden der Democratic Alliance gewählt und konnte sich damit gegen acht weitere Kandidaten durchsetzen. Bei den Wahlen 2014 wurde Aloysias Mmusi Maimane für die DA in die südafrikanische Nationalversammlung gewählt und übernahm dort den Vorsitz der DA-Fraktion. Im Juni 2014 stellte er sein Schattenkabinett vor. Am 10. Mai 2015 wurde Maimane anstelle von Helen Zille zum Parteivorsitzenden der DA gewählt. Maimane ist verheiratet und hat zwei Kinder.

He rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Woolton also proposed changing the name of the party to the Union Party, but when that suggestion fell on deaf ears he instead emphasised a rhetoric that characterised opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour\". He is given significant credit for the Conservative victory in 1951, their first since 1935.",

Después de la Revolución Gloriosa fue diputado en Cortes Generales, donde dirigió el Partido Federal, y ministro de la Gobernación con Estanislao Figueras. Tras la dimisión de este, las Cortes le eligieron Presidente, cargo desde el cual se enfrentó a la Tercera Guerra Carlista y la Revolución Cantonal, defendiendo el Proyecto de Constitución Federal de 1873. Se vio obligado a dimitir ante la imposibilidad de desarrollar su labor de gobierno tras el Cantón de Cartagena. Como intelectual se dedicó esencialmente a la Historia, la Filosofía y el Arte. Se le considera como uno de los intelectuales representativos del pensamiento más avanzado de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX. Escribió multitud de obras y fue redactor y director de varios periódicos. Tuvo contacto con las grandes figuras de la intelectualidad europea de la época, lo que le granjeó una enorme reputación en España y fuera de ella. Con una biografía intachable debida a su honradez, acompañada por una dedicación intensa a sus principios políticos, se ha convertido en un referente de la tradición democrática española.",

  "text" : "Frank Trevor Blevins (3 June 1939 – 7 September 2013) was an Australian politician and 6th Deputy Premier of South Australia from 1992 to 1993 for the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Blevins served in both the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. He was a minister in a number of portfolios. In 1983 in a dispute about the use of volunteers in the ambulance service, as minister for Health, he publicly sided with the St. John Council who managed the ambulance service and two unions, the Ambulance Employees Association and the Miscellaneous Workers Association. John Cornwall, reflects that this position probably damaged his credibility at the time, with both unions and the Labor Party. Blevins was Treasurer of South Australia from 1992 to 1993. Prior to entering parliament he was a British merchant seaman and then a merchant seaman at Whyalla. He died at his home in 2013.",

As Viceroy of India, he is noted for the creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam. As Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he drew the Curzon Line as the proposed eastern frontier of Poland. He was passed over as Prime Minister in 1923 in favour of Stanley Baldwin. His character polarised opinion amongst his contemporaries, \"sow[ing] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands\". He quarrelled endlessly and his arrogance and inflexibility made even more enemies. Critics have been negative in contrasting his enormous talents and energy on behalf of British imperialism with his mixed results and unrealized ambitions.",

  "text" : "George Henry Williams (March 26, 1823 – April 4, 1910) was an American judge and politician. He served as Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon's U.S. Senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the Virginius, a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C. Gibbs United States District Attorney at Portland, Oregon. In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General under the controversy of his wife allegedly taking payment money from the custom house firm Pratt & Boyd in order to drop litigation by the U.S. Justice Department. After his resignation, Williams took part in counting Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes in settling the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland's mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams advocated women's suffrage and that marriage and divorce proceedings needed to be handled by the civil courts rather than the church. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted while Mayor of Portland for not enforcing gambling restriction statutes; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor. On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Williams was the second to last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration.",

Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972.

  "text" : "Alfred Deakin (3 August 1856 – 7 October 1919) was a leader of the movement for Australian federation and later the second Prime Minister of Australia. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including pro-worker industrial reforms. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia. It is likely that he could have been Premier of Victoria, but he chose to devote his energy to federation. Throughout the 1890s Deakin was a participant in conferences of representatives of the Australian colonies that were established to draft a constitution for the proposed federation. He played an important role in ensuring that the draft was liberal and democratic and in achieving compromises to enable its eventual success. Between conferences, he worked to popularise the concept of federation and campaigned for its acceptance in colonial referenda. He then fought hard to ensure acceptance of the proposed constitution by the Government of the United Kingdom. As Prime Minister, Deakin completed a significant legislative program that makes him, with Labor's Andrew Fisher, the founder of an effective Commonwealth government. He expanded the High Court, provided major funding for the purchase of ships, leading to the establishment of the Royal Australian Navy as a significant force under the Fisher government, and established Australian control of Papua. Confronted by the rising Australian Labor Party in 1909, he merged his Protectionist Party with Joseph Cook's Anti-Socialist Party to create the Commonwealth Liberal Party (known commonly as the Fusion), the main ancestor of the modern Liberal Party of Australia. The Deakin-led Liberal Party government lost to Fisher Labor at the 1910 election, which saw the first time a federal political party had been elected with a majority in either house in Federal Parliament. Deakin resigned from Parliament prior to the 1913 election, with Joseph Cook winning the Liberal Party leadership ballot.",

In 1873, Fountain moved from El Paso to Mesilla with his wife Mariana Pérez Fountain and their five children. He served the Union Army in California and Arizona during the American Civil War and later as a militia officer defending against raiding Apaches. Later, however, he developed a long and supportive history with several tribes, many Mescaleros calling him a friend. In Mesilla, he worked as assistant district attorney and probate judge as well as a newspaper editor, founding, in 1877, the Mesilla Valley Independent and the Spanish edition El Independiente del Valle de la Mesilla. He also founded the Mesilla Dramatic Society and the Mesilla Valley Opera House, now The Fountain Theater, both originally operated by his family. Following a purge of corruption among cattle rustlers, Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry disappeared near White Sands, New Mexico, where his wagon, stains of blood, and evidence of an ambush were left. Suspicion centered on two rival landowners, Oliver M. Lee and Albert B. Fall. The bodies were never discovered.",
