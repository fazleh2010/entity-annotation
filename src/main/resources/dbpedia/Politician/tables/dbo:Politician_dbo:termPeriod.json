In 1998 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as a member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, representing the seat of Thuringowa. He was appointed Spokesperson for Communication, Local Government, Planning, Regional and Rural Communities, Environment, Heritage and Natural Resources, and Primary Industries on 7 August. On 6 February 1999, together with party colleagues Dorothy Pratt and Shaun Nelson, he resigned from One Nation to sit as an independent. He was defeated by Labor's Anita Phillips in 2001. He contested Thuringowa again at the 2009 state election against sitting Labor MP Craig Wallace, but received only around 11% of the vote.",

  "text" : "Gaius Julius Caesar (Classical Latin: [ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar]; 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence. After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\", giving him additional authority. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus. A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.",

  "text" : "Joyce Gwendolen Quin, Baroness Quin, PC (born 26 November 1944) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. Quin was educated at Whitley Bay Grammar School, University of Newcastle and the London School of Economics. She worked as a French language lecturer and tutor at the University of Bath and Durham University. She served as Member of the European Parliament for Tyne South and Wear and Tyne and Wear successively from 1979 to 1989, and entered the House of Commons in the 1987 election as Member of Parliament for Gateshead East. After boundary changes for the 1997 general election, she represented the new Gateshead East and Washington West constituency from 1997 until she stepped down at the 2005 general election and was replaced by Sharon Hodgson. Quin served as prisons minister, Minister for Europe, and as a junior agriculture minister. She asked to retire as a minister in 2001 to concentrate on her constituency interests. She had intended to stand for membership of a North East Regional Assembly on her retirement from Westminster, but the proposed body was rejected by a margin of 4–1 in a referendum in November 2004. In April 2006, it was announced that Quin had been nominated for a life peerage by the Labour Party. On 30 May, she was created Baroness Quin, of Gateshead in the County of Tyne and Wear. In November 2007, she was appointed Chair of the Franco-British Council (British Section). She was appointed a shadow Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister by Harriet Harman in May 2010, and was retained in that role by Ed Miliband after his election as Leader of the Labour Party. She stood down from this position in July 2011. Quin is the grand-niece of Labour Party politician Joshua Ritson (1874–1955).",

Ellis was easily re-elected in 1860 over John Pool. As the American Civil War was beginning, President Abraham Lincoln requested troops from North Carolina to quell the rebellion. Ellis replied, “I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.” During the start of the U.S. Civil War Governor John Willis Ellis ordered cadets from the North Carolina Military Academy to Raleigh, North Carolina to serve as drill masters.

  "text" : "Johan de Witt or Jan de Witt, heer van Zuid- en Noord-Linschoten, Snelrewaard, Hekendorp and IJsselveere (24 September 1625 – 20 August 1672) was a key figure in Dutch politics in the mid-17th century, when its flourishing sea trade in a period of globalisation made the United Provinces a leading European power during the Dutch Golden Age. De Witt controlled the Netherlands political system from around 1650 until shortly before his death in 1672 working with various factions from nearly all the major cities, especially his hometown, Dordrecht, and the city of birth of his wife, Amsterdam. As a republican he opposed the House of Orange. He was also strongly liberal, preferring lesser power to the central government and more power to the regenten. However, his negligence of the Dutch land army (as the regents focused only on merchant vessels, thinking they could avoid war) proved disastrous when the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar. In the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of three countries, he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague.",

He stayed on that post for 25 years, which is the longest period for any Governor-General. The Dutch colony in the Indies flourished under Maetsuycker. Under his rule, the Portuguese lost Ceylon (1658), the coast of Coromandel (1658) and Malabar (1663); Makassar was conquered (1667), the west coast of Sumatra was occupied, and the first expedition to the interior of Java was held. In 1663 his wife, Haesje Berckmans, died. In 1664, he married the 24-year-old Elisabeth Abbema, daughter of the preacher Fredericus Abbema and widow of Simon Cos, governor of Ambon.

The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia.",

He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate. Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated, 57.3 to 38.9. Though considered as a frontrunner, in April 2015, he declined to run for the US Senate seat Marco Rubio is expected to vacate before the Senate elections, 2016 to run for the US Presidency. Atwater has since changed his mind, stating that he may run in the upcoming 2016 Senate election.",

Voight served on the Appleton City Council from 1983–1993, holding the position of council president from 1992 - 1993. When incumbent Treasurer Cathy Zeuske ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1994, Voight ran as the Republican nominee to replace her. He was elected that year, and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. He was defeated for re-election on November 7, 2006, by Democrat Dawn Marie Sass, a former parole officer and AFSCME union activist, now working as a clerk at the department store Boston Store, in what was considered an upset. Voight had defeated Sass in both 1998 and 2002, and Sass said she spent less than $4000 on the race, most out of her own pocket. Voight held the position of president of the National Association of State Treasurers in 1997. In May 2009, Voight announced his interest in seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in 2010, but instead, the following June Voight announced he was going to run to replace retiring Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer. On April 5, 2011, he was defeated by former Assemblyman and unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor Tom Nelson, by roughly 52% - 48%. Voight blamed the political unrest stemming from Governor Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents.\"",

During his last term of parliament, Pearce took several months leave to receive treatment for depression. He retired at the 2009 state election. After recovering from his illness, Pearce returned to politics, gaining pre-selection to contest the seat of Mirani at the 2012 Queensland State Election, although he failed to gain the seat. Pearce was once again endorsed as the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Mirani in 2014, and this time was successful. Pearce was born in the Sydney suburb of Paddington. Prior to entering politics, he was a coal miner. He was also a Broadsound Shire councillor and served as a Corporal in the Vietnam War. Pearce has three sons.",

In his early life, Taylor lived in various countries and studied languages in Germany. He worked as a merchant and got married when he returned to England. Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

In 1993 he was elected as a Reform Member of Parliament in the Saskatchewan riding of Kindersley—Lloydminster. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 until 1995. Due to redistribution his hometown was located in the new constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar for the 1997 election. He ran against fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party for the new seat and lost. Hermanson sought the leadership of the newly founded Saskatchewan Party in 1998, and defeated Rod Gantefoer and Yogi Huyghebaert in a one member one vote election. He was elected to the provincial legislature for Rosetown-Biggar in the 1999 provincial election and became Leader of the Opposition. While the party reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party to a minority government, it was almost nonexistent outside the rural areas; it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party five seats short of making Hermanson Premier. Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in 2003. However, he came up short again in the provincial election that November, in which the NDP actually won a bare majority. While the Saskatchewan Party scored a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election and was subsequently succeeded by Brad Wall. Hermanson remained the MLA for the new constituency of Rosetown-Elrose. On Friday, June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature.",

In 1950, Luard joined the Foreign Service and after learning Chinese he was stationed in Peking from 1952 to 1954. In 1956 he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest at Britain's involvement in the Suez Crisis. He became a research fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford in 1957 where he was able to research Chinese relations with Britain. He was a Labour councillor on Oxford City Council 1958–61. Luard was Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford from 1966 to 1970 and again from October 1974 to 1979 for the Labour Party, having first contested the seat in 1964; he was the only Labour member ever to represent the constituency in its original form. He served as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Foreign Office from 1969 till 1970 and again from 1976 until Labour left power in 1979. Luard joined the SDP soon after its formation, and contested the 1983 General election for the party in the newly formed constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon. He was de-selected in 1987 in favour of Chris Huhne. Luard is also known for his sociological theories including the hierarchy theory. His exhaustive study of war, War in International Society: A Study in International Sociology, was published in Britain in 1986 and by Yale University Press in the United States in 1987.",

He was the ninth and youngest son of the reverent. He fought in the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s, and was a Major in the Territorial Army. On 28 April 1868, Hamlin married Sarah Grace Barriball, the daughter of Charles Barriball of Waiuku, at his father's house near Waiuku (Barriball Road in Waiuku commemorates the location of the family's land). Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Remuera on 4 June 1900. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and seven daughters.",

Premier Danny Williams dismissed Verge's comments, saying that \"he didn't understand that that's what it meant\", and that, \"for what it's worth, he's entitled to his opinion.\" Verge was later booed at a rally against the cuts after he reversed himself and sided with the government, although he stated he also supported the people of his district.On October 7, Premier Williams appointed a new Minister of Health and Community Services.Joined by the new minister in Lewisporte on October 14, Verge stated, \"Government is looking harder and digging deeper to try and find a solution to the problem. ...Hopefully at the end of the day we will be able to deliver all the services that the people want coming out of Lewisporte.\"The government subsequently reversed its decision to remove laboratory and X-ray services from Lewisporte, as Verge reported in his year-end interview, saying, \"It was an issue that caused me to have a greater appreciation for the people throughout our district and to also have a greater respect for our government - a government that proved it was willing to listen to the people and if necessary, to change its mind.\"",

During the Civil War, Eba enlisted in Company I, Fifth West Virginia Regiment; was promoted to sergeant-major, March, 1862; first lieutenant.

He represented Vancouver City from 1924 to 1928 in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a Conservative. He was born in Ontario in 1878 and came to Vancouver to expand his bakery business. Shelly's bakery was known for its \"Four-X bread\". During the 1920s, he helped create a conglomerate known as Canadian Bakeries Ltd. to which he sold his business. Shelly became vice-president and general manager of the new company. He was also president of the Home Oil Co. Ltd., Canada Grain Export Co. Ltd., Guaranty Savings and Loan, Crescent Beach Development Co. Ltd., Grouse Mountain Highway and Scenic Resort Ltd. and the Shelly Building. Shelly served as finance minister in the provincial cabinet. In the fiscal year 1929/1930, the province suffered a fairly small deficit of $135,000. Shelly projected an increase of government revenues and a small surplus for the following fiscal year; instead, revenues decreased and expenditures were larger than projected, resulting in a then-record deficit of $4.8 million. Shelly was transferred to the position of president of the Executive Council in October 1930. He also suffered a large personal financial loss when share prices for Home Oil Co. Ltd. bottomed out in the years following the stock market crash. He retired from politics in 1933. Shelly died in Vancouver at the age of 72.",

His political journey began after he was elected the Sarpanch or head of his Sofi village (Jalandhar District). He has held several key posts in the BJP's Punjab unit. When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled.",

Once known as President Nixon's \"hatchet man,\" Colson gained notoriety at the height of the Watergate scandal, for being named as one of the Watergate Seven, and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for attempting to defame Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg. In 1974, he served seven months in the federal Maxwell Prison in Alabama as the first member of the Nixon administration to be incarcerated for Watergate-related charges. Colson became a Christian in 1973. His mid-life conversion to Christianity sparked a radical life change that led to the founding of his non-profit ministry Prison Fellowship and to a focus on Christian worldview teaching and training. Colson was also a public speaker and the author of more than 30 books. He was the founder and chairman of The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which is \"a research, study, and networking center for growing in a Christian worldview\", and while he was alive included Colson's daily radio commentary, BreakPoint, which was heard in its original format on more than 1,400 outlets across the United States. Colson was a principal signer of the 1994 Evangelicals and Catholics Together ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholic leaders in the United States. Colson received 15 honorary doctorates, and in 1993 was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the world's largest annual award (over US$1 million) in the field of religion, given to a person who \"has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension\". He donated this prize to further the work of Prison Fellowship, as he did all his speaking fees and royalties. In 2008, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush.",

  "text" : "Cameron A. Morrison (October 5, 1869 – August 20, 1953) was the 55th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1921 to 1925. He was born in 1869 in Richmond County, North Carolina. With the backing of Sen. Furnifold Simmons and the help of race-baiting tactics employed by A. D. Watts, Morrison defeated O. Max Gardner in the 1920 Democratic primary for Governor. He was later called \"the Good Roads governor\" for his support of a modern highway system. Morrison also pushed for increased funds for public education, while also battling the teaching of the theory of evolution. He was later appointed to serve as a United States Senator for the state of North Carolina (after the death of Lee S. Overman) between 1930 and 1932, but lost his seat in the Democratic primary runoff to Robert R. Reynolds. Morrison was later elected to one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He again lost a Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 1944, to Clyde R. Hoey. He died in Quebec City in 1953. A ten-story residence hall on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill is named in his honor. His home at Charlotte, Morrocroft, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.",

  "text" : "Charles Augustus \"Charlie\" Semlin (4 December 1836 – November 2, 1927) was a British Columbia politician and rancher. Born near Barrie, Upper Canada, Semlin worked there as a schoolteacher until 1862 when he moved to British Columbia during the gold rush to become a prospector. Failing at that, he took work under Clement Francis Cornwall at the Ashcroft Manor Ranch. With Philip Parke he established the Cache Creek Hotel. In 1869 he purchased the Dominion Ranch and became a rancher. He entered politics when British Columbia became a province of Canada, in 1871, winning the Yale riding in the provincial legislature in 1871 and was defeated in 1876, though won election again in 1882. He as Leader of the Opposition in 1884. While in politics Semlin was instrumental in the building and operating of a boarding school in Cache Creek. The site was chosen there as Cache Creek was the midpoint between the Cariboo region to the north and the populated areas of the Lower Mainland to the south. He lost his seat in 1875 but returned to the assembly in 1882. In 1894 he became leader of the opposition and finally the 12th Premier of British Columbia in August 1898. His government lasted only two years and resigned to make way for the rump regime of Joseph Martin, who was defeated in the election of 1900. He died on November 3, 1927 at his ranch, which is just east of Cache Creek, British Columbia.",

He was born in Halifax County, North Carolina in 1869. His father was William H. Kitchin and William Walton Kitchin was his brother. First elected in 1900, after his party secured a constitutional amendment excluding blacks from the ballot boxes of the state, a campaign in which he served as a leading orator, he served in Congress as a member of the Democratic Party until his death. In Congress, he served on the House Ways and Means Committee, chairing the Committee from 1915 to 1919. From 1915 to 1919 he was House majority leader; from this position he opposed the Wilson administration's \"Preparedness\" crusade, seeking unsuccessfully to hold down the growth in size of the army and navy. He was one of the representatives who voted against declaring war on Germany in April 1917; indeed, his example and speech against American entry probably swelled the number of dissenters to 50. He threw himself into the war effort thereafter but remained a critic of some of the administration's war policies, especially regarding taxation policies. He championed an \"excess profits\" tax that was steeply progressive over a policy of selling Liberty Bonds that shifted the financial burden of the war onto future generations. After giving an impassioned speech in 1920 he suffered a severe stroke, from which he never recovered.",

Molloy first entered Queensland state parliament as one of a number of newly elected Labor MPs following the party's landslide win at the 2001 state election. She was subsequently re-elected at the 2004 state election. In 2006, Molloy publicly opposed her party's policy to build a dam on the Mary River. This stance resulted in her disendorsement as a Labor Party candidate in June 2006. She continued to sit as a Labor MP before quitting the party in August 2006. Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election. The following year, Molloy unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Wide Bay, also in an independent capacity. In the 2009 state election, she unsuccessfully re-contested Noosa. Molloy was born in East Melbourne, Victoria. She was married to Ivan Molloy, who was the endorsed Labor candidate for Fairfax at the 2004 federal election.",

  "text" : "Chaudhary Brahm Prakash (1918–1993) played an important role in the Individual Satyagraha Movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1940 and was among the leaders of the ‘underground’ activities in Delhi during the ‘Quit India’ movement. He was imprisoned many times during the freedom struggle. He hailed from Shakurpur Village, a yadav dominated village in North-West Delhi. In the post-independence era, Prakash, a member of India's yadav community, served as Minister in charge of Planning and Development as well as the first Chief Minister of Delhi from 1952-55. His stints in the Parliament twice won him accolades as an able parliamentarian. He also made noteworthy contributions as the Union Cabinet Minister for Food, Agriculture, Irrigation and Cooperatives. The cause of depressed sections of the society, rural development and empowerment of the weaker sections were issues which were very close to the heart of Chaudhary Brahm Prakash. He was quick to realise the potential of cooperative societies in mitigating the hardships of the village folks. As early as in 1945, he started organising village and agriculture cooperatives. He was also a proponent of the Panchayati Raj institutions. He organised the National Union of Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities in 1977 to work for the welfare of these weaker sections.",

Before entering parliament Dr Davis worked as the director of geriatric medicine at The Prince Charles Hospital. He has served as president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association and was the state chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. On 13 May 2014, Davis was sacked from Cabinet in response to his speaking against the government on a number of matters. Premier Campbell Newman said Davis had failed to observe the convention that cabinet members and assistant ministers are bound by collective decision making. Although Davis initially stated that he intended to retire at the next state election, he resigned from the Parliament on 23 May 2014. A 2014 Stafford by-election was held on Saturday 19 July 2014. On 25 July 2014, in an interview on the ABC's 7.30 Queensland, Davis stated that he had resigned from the Liberal National Party and had spoken to Australian Labor Party state secretary Anthony Chisholm about the potential for continuing his political career with Labor, potentially running in Newman's seat of Ashgrove. The following day, Leader of the Opposition Annastacia Palaszczuk stated that Davis was not a member of the Labor Party and would not be running as a Labor candidate. On the same day, Davis submitted his application to join the Labor Party, and also stated that he was interested in federal politics if he was unsuccessful in obtaining a state seat.",

Neilson was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly on 23 November 1946 at the age of 21, representing the Australian Labor Party (ALP). For many years he was not only the youngest MHA in Tasmania, but also the youngest person to be elected to any Australian parliament. He held various cabinet offices, including those of Minister for Tourism and Attorney-General. He was Minister for Education for over ten years from 1958 to 1969, and again from 1972 to 1974. He was made Attorney-General again on 12 April 1974, and five days later was also made Deputy Premier, Police Minister and Environment Minister. When the Premier Eric Reece was required to retire due to his age, Neilson was elected Tasmanian Leader of the ALP and Premier of Tasmania, on 31 March 1975. He resigned as Premier, and from Parliament, on 1 December 1977. After his term as premier, Neilson accepted the position as Agent-General for Tasmania in London. In the 1980s, he wrote as a theatre critic for The Mercury newspaper in Hobart. He died in November 1989, aged 64.",

Innerhalb der Partei führte er von 2005 bis 2012 die Ibuki-Faktion (offiziell: Shisuikai). Ibuki studierte bis 1960 Wirtschaftswissenschaften an der Universität Kyōto. Anschließend war er Beamter im Finanzministerium. 1983 wurde er erstmals im 1. Wahlkreis der Präfektur Kyōto ins Unterhaus gewählt und seither sieben Mal bestätigt. Von September 1997 bis Juli 1998 war er Arbeitsminister im Kabinett von Ryūtarō Hashimoto. Unter Premierminister Yoshirō Mori war er zwischen 2000 und 2001 Vorsitzender der Nationalen Kommission für öffentliche Sicherheit und Staatsminister für Katastrophenschutz. Von 2006 bis 2007 war Ibuki Bildungsminister im Kabinett von Shinzō Abe. Kurz nach seinem Amtsantritt hatte er sich dagegen ausgesprochen, Englisch als Fremdsprache verpflichtend in die Lehrpläne japanischer Grundschulen aufzunehmen: „Es gibt keinen Grund Englisch zu lernen, solange die Kinder nicht schönes Japanisch sprechen“. Nach Abes Rücktritt wurde er unter dem Parteivorsitzenden Yasuo Fukuda, den seine Faktion bei der Wahl gegen Tarō Asō unterstützt hatte, Generalsekretär der LDP. Bei der Kabinettsumbildung am 1. August 2008 ernannte Fukuda Ibuki zum Finanzminister, Nachfolger als Generalsekretär wurde Tarō Asō. Als dieser einen Monat später zum Parteivorsitzenden und Premierminister gewählt wurde, ersetzte er Ibuki durch Shōichi Nakagawa. Im neuen Kabinett war Ibukis Einfluss gewachsen: die Ibuki-Faktion war dort mit drei Ministern vertreten. Bei der für die LDP verheerenden Unterhauswahl 2009 verlor Ibuki seinen Wahlkreis an den Demokraten Tomoyuki Taira, wurde aber über den Verhältniswahlblock Kinki wiedergewählt. Bei der Unterhauswahl 2012 erhielt Ibuki weniger Stimmen als 2009, konnte seinen Wahlkreis mit weniger als einem Drittel der Stimmen aber in einem zersplitterten Kandidatenfeld zurückgewinnen. Anschließend wurde er zum Präsidenten des Unterhauses gewählt. Den Vorsitz der bisherigen Ibuki-Faktion übernahm Toshihiro Nikai. Ibuki ist, wie Premier Abe und weitere Kabinett- und LDP-Parteimitglieder, Mitglied der als revisionistisch geltenden Nippon Kaigi. Ibukis Ehefrau Yūko ist eine Enkelin von Takahashi Ryūtarō, dem Eigentümer des Baseball-Teams Takahashi Unions, Vorsitzenden des japanischen Fußballverbandes, Ryokufūkai-Oberhausabgeordneten und Ministers für Internationalen Handel und Industrie der Nachkriegszeit.",

Besonders in ländlichen Gebieten drängte er auf Bildung, Abschaffung des Mitgift-Systems und der Kinderheirat, sowie für das Recht auf Wiederheirat für Witwen. Gupta war oberster Schirmherr mehrerer Bildungseinrichtungen in Haryana. Er wurde dreimal in das Parlament des Bundesstaates Haryana gewählt und fungierte einmal als dessen Sprecher. Einige Jahre war er Minister, Vize-Chief-Minister und zweimal Chief Minister von Haryana. 1996 wurde er in die Rajya Sabha gewählt.

Robbins was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, son of Capt. B. Robbins, and educated at the Yarmouth Academy. He arrived in Wellington in 1874, and was a storekeeper in Hawera from 1881. In Hawera he organised a local dairy factory and the National Dairy Association. He was on various local boards; Fire Board (3 years), Hospital Board (chairman 1906-09), and the Wanganui Education Board 1897-1906. His first public service was as a member of the school committee in Hawera for a good decade, where he was chairman for most of that time. He was a member of the Hawera Borough Council for fifteen years and Mayor of Hawera for seven years. Robbins stood in the 1893 election in the Egmont electorate and came second of three candidates. He contested the Hawera electorate in the 1896 and 1905 elections. He came a close second in 1896, and came third in 1905. Robbins moved to Tauranga in 1911, and was Mayor of Tauranga twice, from 1912 to 1915 and 1929 to 1933. He retired from the mayoralty in 1915 and did not contest the election, which was won by Charles MacMillan over John Cuthbert Adams. Robbins stood against the incumbent, William Herries of the Reform Party, in the 1919 election in the Tauranga electorate and was beaten with a margin of over 30% of the vote. He initially declared himself an Independent Progressive Liberal but received the endorsement of Joseph Ward and was the official candidate of the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Legislative Council by the First Labour Government. He died in January 1953 aged 96 and is buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery on 18th Avenue in Tauranga.

Under Bickett's leadership, the state saw improvements in child welfare, public health, electricity, and running water. He persuaded the legislature to establish the state's first income tax.

He was a son of John Caldwell (1779–1857) and Hannah Pickett Robinson (1794–1875). He was born in Morganton, Burke County, North Carolina where he had a home for most of his life. Caldwell attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating on June 4, 1840. He was a member of Dialectic Senate. He was examined by the Supreme Court and admitted to Superior Court Practice (much like passing a bar examination) in June 1841, becoming solicitor for Burke County. In 1842 he was elected a member of the North Carolina House of Commons in which he served two sessions. In 1850 he represented Burke County in the state senate. After the close of the Civil War he was a member of the Reconstruction Convention, and President of Western North Carolina Railroad. Caldwell was elected the first Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 1868, the same year the state constitution had created the office. He became governor in 1871 upon the impeachment and conviction of Governor William Woods Holden. Caldwell was elected governor in his own right in 1872, by about two thousand majority, becoming the second Republican elected governor of North Carolina. His areas of interest were the state debt and the state finances and the opening of the public schools which had been closed in 1863 due to lack of money. He appointed Alexander McIver as Superintendent of Public Instruction and got a bill passed allowing private aid for public schools in order to gain funds to reopen the schools. Caldwell married Minerva Ruffin Cain on December 12, 1840. Tod and Minerva had at least four children: Mary Ruffin Caldwell, wife of Dr. Waighstill Collett; John \"Jack\" Caldwell, killed at Gettysburg; Martha R. Caldwell, wife of Edward W. Ward; and Hannah J. Caldwell, wife of Walter Brem. Shortly after arriving on July 9, 1874 at Hillsborough, Orange County, North Carolina to attend the railroad's stockholders' meeting, Caldwell became very ill and died unexpectedly two days later on July 11, 1874. Newspaper reports stated he died from cholera morbus. His body was returned to the state capital to lie in state after which his body was carried to Morganton and buried in the family plot in Forest Hill Cemetery.",

During her time in office she headed the Federal Department of Justice and Police. She won 14 referendums during her time in office. On 10 December 2003, she became the third member of the council not to be reelected in the history of the Swiss Federal State. In the 2003 Federal Assembly elections, her party lost many voters and the Swiss People's Party became the largest party of Switzerland. The Swiss People's party then requested another seat in the Federal Council. In the elections for the Federal Council on 10 December, the Federal Assembly did not re-elect Ruth Metzler and elected Christoph Blocher instead, by 121 votes to 116 on the third round of voting. She challenged her CVP colleague Joseph Deiss for his seat, but lost by 138 to 96. Metzler kept her seat until the end of the year and Christoph Blocher succeeded her on 1 January 2004. She published the memories of those years under the title \"Grissini & Alpenbitter\", 2004, ISBN 3-85882-388-0. She was teaching between February 2004 and July 2004 at the University of St. Gallen a class called \"Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten in der Politik\" which can be translated as \"scope for design in politics\". Since April 2005 she has been working for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis.",

In 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate \"Liberal-Labour\" platform. He ran for Vancouver's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power. Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. Ralph Smith was a supporter of women's suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed.",

Robert William Carrall pochodził z jednej z najszacowniejszych rodzin kanadyjskich, lojalistycznych wychodźców z Nowej Anglii. Urodził się w Woodstock w Górnej Kanadzie. W 1859 ukończył uniwersytet uzyskując doktorat z medycyny. W czasie wojny secesyjnej w USA pracował jako kontraktowy chirurg w armii Unii. Po zakończeniu wojny pozostał w USA przyjmując posadę najpierw w szpitalu w Waszyngtonie, a następnie w Nowym Orleanie. W 1865 opuścił Stanu Zjednoczone i osiedlił się na Wyspa Vancouver gdzie w Nanaimo rozpoczął prywatna praktykę lekarską. Carrall został także przedsiębiorcą i finansistą. Ryzykowne, lecz szczęśliwe inwestycje w górnictwie przyniosły mu fortunę, która stała się przepustką do wyższych sfer kolonii. Corrall reprezentował stanowisko zdecydowanie prokanadyjskie i prokonfederacyjne. Jego wieloletni pobyt w USA przekonał go, że zagospodarowanie pluskowi kanadyjskich jest celowe i możliwe. Wierzył też, że Kanada jest w stanie konkurować ze swym sąsiadem i ściągnąć na swe tereny większość emigrantów opuszczających Europę. W 1868 jako konfederata, zdobył swój pierwszy mandat do legislatury kolonialnej. Brał aktywny udział w debacie konfederacyjnej. W styczniu 1870 Anthony Musgrave powołał go do rady rządowej kolonii, a w kwietniu do trzyosobowej delegacji na negocjacje zjednoczeniowe z rządem w Kanadzie. W czasie negocjacji był jedynym z trójki, który miął okazje spotkać się osobiście z chorującym pierwszym premierem Kanady Johnem Macdonaldem. Po dołączeniu Kolumbii Brytyjskiej do Kanady jako szóstej prowincji zamieszkał w niej jakiś czas. W 1872 został powołany do Senatu, jako przedstawiciel swej prowincji. W Senacie wsławił się propozycją by dzień 1 lipca, rocznicę zawiązania Konfederacji Kanady, a także przystąpienia do niej Kolumbii Brytyjskiej w pięć lat później, obchodzić jako święto państwowe – Canada Day – Dzień Kanady. Carrall zmarł przedwcześnie w wieku 40 lat, na powikłania w związku z wrzodem żołądka.",

  "text" : "Robert Garnett Tatlow (September 6, 1855 – April 11, 1910) was an Irish-born businessman and political figure in British Columbia. He represented Vancouver City in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1900 to 1909 as a Conservative. He was born in Scarva, the son of John Garnett Tatlow and Anne Matthews, and was educated in Cheltenham. After completing his schooling, Tatlow came to Montreal where he was hired by the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company and later a brokerage office. He joined the militia and came to Victoria in 1879 to inspect the coastal defences there. Tatlow remained there as instructor to the local militia and custodian for artillery supplies. The following year, he was hired as private secretary to the lieutenant governor, Albert Norton Richards. He continued in the same function for Richards' successor, Clement Francis Cornwall. Tatlow resigned that post in 1886 and moved to Vancouver where he was a real estate, insurance and mining broker. He was a member of the city's park committee from 1888 to 1905 and served as chairman from 1895 to 1903. In 1893, he married Elizabeth Mary Cambie. Tatlow ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1890 and 1894 before being elected in 1900. He introduced a private member's bill requiring all immigrants to be able to write in a European language. Tatlow served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Finance and Agriculture and as Commissioner of Lands and Works. He also served as deputy premier. He resigned his seat in October 1909 after Richard McBride proposed guarantees to help finance the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway. Tatlow died in Victoria at the age of 54 after being ejected from his carriage. Mount Tatlow was named in his honour.",

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice and Howden, Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, having previously been Minister of State at the Foreign Office from July 1994 to April 1997. Davis was raised on Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, South West London. After attending Bec Grammar School in Tooting, London, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with Tate & Lyle. Entering Parliament in 1987 at the age of 38 for the Boothferry constituency, in his subsequent political career he held the positions of Conservative party chairman and Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the shadow cabinet, under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and then second. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary. This was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP in June 2008, he officially became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won it in July 2008. In 2010, Davis was invited by Prime Minister David Cameron to join the cabinet of his coalition government, but he declined and stayed on the backbenches. In July 2016, following the UK voting to leave the European Union, Davis was appointed by Theresa May as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.",

Along with Peter Beattie, he was the leading figure in the push during the late 1970s to have the Queensland branch of the party reformed. After the success of the reform movement, and intervention from the party's federal headquarters, he became State Branch President. He was elected to the Parliament of Queensland for the electorate of Stafford at the 1983 state election. Murphy completed biographies on a number of Queensland ALP figures, notably Thomas J. Ryan and Bill Hayden. He was working on a biography of Andrew Fisher before his death. Murphy was diagnosed with cancer in 1983 and died in 1984, aged 47. He died before having the opportunity to make a speech as a Member of Parliament.",

She was elected to the State Parliament as the Member for Perth in 1993, succeeding Dr Ian Alexander who had retired. She was re-elected in 1996 but did not contest the February 2001 election. Her political career was entirely from the opposition bench, during the premiership of Richard Court. Warnock served as Opposition whip, spokesperson for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and the Arts and spokesperson for Women's Interests and Racing & Gaming. She also served as President of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. In 1996, Warnock and upper house MP Cheryl Davenport steered a controversial pro-choice bill through the parliament—the \"Acts Amendment (Abortion) Bill\", which effectively decriminalised abortion and enabled women to access abortions of pregnancies up to 20 weeks on the basis of informed consent. In 1999 she was named the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. As of 2013, she is the current patron of the Friends of Perth International Arts Festival. Warnock was married to local novelist, playwright and arts patron Bill Warnock, who died in 2001.",

McPherson did not run and Huyghebaert then won a resounding victory. He was re-elected in 2003.

  "text" : "Helen Mamayaok Maksagak, CM (April 15, 1931 – January 23, 2009) was a Canadian politician. She served as the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories (Canada) from January 16, 1995 until March 26, 1999 and as the Commissioner of Nunavut from April 1, 1999 until April 1, 2000. She is a notable Copper Inuk. Born on the land near Bernard Harbour in the Canadian Western Arctic, Maksagak was raised in Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik and the Bathurst Inlet area and eventually settled in Cambridge Bay to raise a family of six surviving children with her husband John Sr. Together they were stalwart supporters of the growing indigenous rights movement in the Canadian north. Their home was often a stopping place and site of discussions when young Inuit involved in negotiating the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or participating in Northwest Territories political life passed through the community. Maksagak was appointed as Deputy Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in 1992. In 1995, she was appointed as Commissioner, partially in anticipation of the pending creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999. She was the first woman and first Inuk to hold the office. In April 1999 she transferred with her office to the new Nunavut Territory and continued to provide stability to the new government in transition. She served until April 2000 as the first commissioner of the newly created territory of Nunavut and then as Assistant Commissioner of Nunavut from 2005 until her death in 2009. Helen Maksagak was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada in May, 2003. She served as a member of the Qulliit (Nunavut) Status of Women Council and as an Elder for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. Maksagak died on January 23, 2009 at the age of 77. Helen Maksagak Drive in Iqaluit is named in her memory.",

  "text" : "Herman Henry (H. H.) Kemper was an American-born farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan. He represented Gull Lake in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1934 to 1938. He was born on a farm in Hebron, Nebraska, the son of Frank Herman Kemper and Louisa Haulker. In 1906, Kemper found work with a survey crew working on the railway west of Edmonton, Alberta. He returned home later that year but, in the summer of 1907, he traveled north again and worked on a farm near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. Later in 1907, he settled on a homestead south of Gull Lake. Kemper returned to Nebraska and married Mina Burwell in 1911. The couple returned to Saskatchewan later that same year. After working on a farm near Moose Jaw, they were able to purchase land not far from his original homestead. Kemper served on the rural municipal district council for Arlington. He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the Saskatchewan general election, 1934, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932. In 1935, it changed its name and officially became the Saskatchewan section of the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF. During the eighth provincial election on June 19, 1934, the FLG had five elected members come to office, including Kemper. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in Gull Lake in 1938 and in the Maple Creek federal riding in 1940. In 1953, Kemper sold his farm and retired to the town of Shaunavon. He died in a car accident near Tompkins while travelling to a CCF rally.",

Troxler, a resident of Browns Summit, North Carolina, studied conservation at North Carolina State University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1974; he later founded a family tobacco and wheat farming operation. Troxler ran for the post of North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture in 2000, losing to Meg Scott Phipps; he ran again for the same position in the 2004 Council of State election, finishing only 2,000 votes ahead of incumbent Democrat Britt Cobb. However, because over 4,000 votes were lost in Carteret County, the race was unresolved for over three months. After extended legal battles between Cobb and Troxler, Cobb conceded the race on February 4, 2005. Troxler was sworn in as North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner on February 8, 2005, a month after the rest of the Council of State, becoming the first Republican Agriculture Commissioner in the state's history. After his inauguration at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, Troxler rode a tractor to his downtown offices. Steve Troxler was elected in 2008 to serve another term as Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the state of North Carolina. In 2012 he was elected to a third term. There has been some controversy regarding his stance on legally carried firearms at the NC State Fair. Opponents like to point out that he promised police escorts for attendees to get to their cars safely, but none were provided.",

The first Commissioner to actually reside in the Northwest Territories, he was a leader in the construction of a semiautonomous, responsible self-government run by residents of the territory. He was appointed as a Citizenship Judge in British Columbia in December 1997 and served until 2005 Hodgson was one of the founders of the Arctic Winter Games - which began in Yellowknife in 1970 for athletes from Alaska, Yukon, and the NWT – and which now also include Greenland, parts of Arctic Russia, as well as Northern Alberta and Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and the new territory Nunavut which was formed from NWT in 1999. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 18, 1970for his service to labour and government. Subsequently he received the Queen's commemorative medals for her silver, golden, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012);as well as the Canada 125 medal in 1992. When rapid changes in socio-economic conditions threatened the continuity of Inuit oral history, Commissioner Hodgson urged the taping of elders' stories. In 1974, the residents of Pangnirtung (since then becoming part of Nunavut) presented the Commissioner with eleven stories which were later compiled into a book. Hodgson was nicknamed \"Umingmak\" by the Inuit. For his services in the NWT, he was presented the public service's Outstanding Achievement Award in 1976. From 1942 to 1945 he served with the Royal Canadian Navy on convoy duty in the North Atlantic for which he received the 1939-1945 Star, Atlantic Star and other World War II medals. From 1979 to 1981 he was Canadian co-chairman of the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission. He was recruited by Premier William R. Bennett of British Columbia to run BC Ferries for a time in the 1980s. He was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the BC Transit in 1985. Hodgson died on December 18, 2015.",

  "text" : "Sadiq Ali (May 2, 1952 – April 18, 2011) was a senior politician of Kashmir, India, a noted poet and writer and an active environmentalist. He was an elected legislator in the Kashmir State Assembly for three consecutive terms. Mr Sadiq Ali was born in Srinagar into an influential business family. His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On March 9, 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party.",

He supported, assisted and nurtured a number of institutions, particularly in Mumbai and enriched the city culturally. He was the Member of Parliament from Bombay when it was part of the unified Bombay State. He was a Union Minister during the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shashtri and Indira Gandhi. Though a three-time MP, he was defeated by George Fernandes in Mumbai South (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1967 for 4th Lok Sabha. He then fought a by-poll from Banaskantha in Gujarat and rejoined Lok Sabha. In 1969 he left Congress of Indira Gandhi with senior leaders like Morarji Desai and Nijalingappa. He contested from Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat in 1971 on Congress (O) ticket but lost to the Congress candidate. In the Lok Sabha discussions on the report of the States Reorganisation Commission, on 15 November 1955, Patil demanded that the Bombay city be constituted as an autonomous city-state, laying great stress on its cosmopolitan character. However, Bombay state was partitioned into the present day states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1960, and the city of Bombay (now called Mumbai) became the capital of Maharashtra.",

  "text" : "(For those of a similar name, see Susan Davis (disambiguation).) Susan Margaret Davies (born 14 March 1954) is a former Australian politician. She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966–70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from Latrobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; it and its predecessors had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent, emerging victorious. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Kennett-government swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \"Independents' Charter\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing Steve Bracks and the Labor Party as the new minority government. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but lost to the Liberal candidate, former MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co-operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil.",

He represents the Surajgarh constituency of Jhunjhunu District of Rajasthan and is a member of the Indian National Congress. He is a true champion of the people. He won the by-poll election held on 13 September by a margin of 3270 votes. This victory is hailed by the media/local people as victory over government as more than 30 sitting BJP MLAs, 6 BJP MPs and 2 Rajasthan state Cabinet Ministers were over-seeing and were literally micro-managing the election campaign for BJP candidate. Sharwan Kumar was born in a family of farmers in a small village called Ghardu Ki Dhani in Surajgarh. He started his political career at a young age and was elected Sarpanch of his Village. He first fought MLA election in 1993 from Pilani and won as an independent candidate. In 2008 Legislative Assembly Elections, he changed his constituency from Pilani to Surajgarh due to Reservation of Pilani Seat. He again won from Surajgarh beating Bhartiya Janta Party Candidate Santosh Ahlawat over a margin of nearly 8000 Votes. He again fought MLA elections in 2013 but lost to BJP candidate Santosh Ahlawat with over 50,000 Votes. His loss came as a surprise among the people and that too, with such a huge margin. Since Santosh Ahlawat became an MP, the Surajgarh assembly seat again went to poll on 13 September 2014.",

In May 2013, Hampshire's PCC was identified by a House of Commons Select Committee as 'being responsible for the largest increase in the budget to run the PCC's office'. According to Hampshire Police the most of a £2 million budget increase went to meet the PCC Policing and Community Priorities. In December 2013 the Hampshire PCC announced further staff; appointing more Commissioners (one Deputy and two Assistants). Hayes faced accusations that he lives in Earls Barton, Northamptonshire, where his wife is vicar of All Saints' Church. However, the IPCC was satisfied that he lived in Hampshire.",

Republicans retook the majority in the New Hampshire House from the Democratic Party in the 2014 election. After the election, William L.

Enough Republicans voted for Shurtleff on the first ballot that O'Brien did not receive the majority. Shurtleff then dropped out of the race, and Jasper entered. On the third ballot, Jasper received the majority of all ballots cast, defeating O'Brien with the majority of Democratic members and some Republicans voting for him.",

Recognized as an authority on constitutional law, he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th century America. Carpenter presented cases before the U. S. Supreme Court involving such matters as states' rights and regulation of corporations. Originally a Democrat, he evolved into a Republican during the Civil War, and helped perpetuate the Wisconsin party's political machinery. His sustained support for President Ulysses S. Grant's administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J.

She is known for a long career of advocating for the less privileged, most often women. Born in Shediac, New Brunswick, she graduated from Mount Allison University in 1921 with a B.A.. In 1926, she retired from only one year's practice at law in the office of her barrister father, James McQueen, to marry Aubrey S. Fergusson. She lived with her husband in Grand Falls, New Brunswick, for ten years, during which time she opened the Malabeam Tea Room, and organized community activities including founding the Grand Falls Literary Club. She was readmitted to the bar in 1936 to support her family after her husband became ill from earlier injuries acquired during service in the First World War; he died six years later. She gradually took over her husband's practice and soon after became New Brunswick's first female judge of a probate court. She also became clerk of the county court and the circuit court and the town solicitor for Grand Falls. Fergusson fought for increased participation of women in politics. In 1946, she successfully petitioned for the right of all women in New Brunswick to vote in municipal elections. Soon after, she challenged the ban on women running for Fredericton City Council. Because no one stepped forward to take advantage, McQueen Fergusson ran for Alderman and won by acclamation in 1950 and 1951. Fergusson also advocated for pay equity and protection of women's and children's rights. She spoke regularly at women's group events on topic of pay equity and wills. She fought to have a pay raise of $100 per year for all male city employees expanded to included female employees as well, up from the proposed $50 per year for females. With the support of letter-writing campaigns by various women's groups, she became the Director of Family Allowances, a position that had originally been restricted to males. She was the first woman elected, in 1950, to the Fredericton City Council as a city councilor and was the first woman deputy mayor in 1953. She was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1953 and was the first woman Speaker of the Senate from 1972 to 1974. She retired in 1975. In 1974, she was sworn to the Privy Council. In 1976 she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.",

  "text" : "Mavroudis „Makis“ Voridis (griechisch Μαυρουδής “Μάκης” Βορίδης, * 1964 in Athen) ist ein griechischer Rechtsanwalt und Politiker. Der ehemalige Anführer, Vorsitzende und Gründungsmitglied mehrerer rechtsextremer Gruppen und Parteien war Verkehrsminister der Übergangsregierung Papadimos für die rechtspopulistische LA.O.S. Nach seinem Wechsel zur konservativen Nea Dimokratia 2012 übernahm Voridis deren Fraktionsvorsitz im griechischen Parlament, zuletzt war er Gesundheitsminister im Kabinett Samaras. Makis Voridis hat ein Studium an der Universität London mit dem Titel Magister der Rechte abgeschlossen. Als Jugendlicher war er in der faschistischen Studentengruppe Eleftheri Mathites (Ελεύθεροι Μαθητές ‚Freie Schüler‘) am Athens College aktiv. Voridis übernahm 1985 von Nikolaos Michaloliakos die Jugendführung der nationalistischen EPEN, die sich für die Freilassung der Junta-Offiziere und die Rückkehr des Königs einsetzte. Nach Voridis’ Ansicht standen diese Parteiziele einer Modernisierung entgegen, deshalb gründete er 1994 die rechtsgerichtete Elliniko Metopo nach dem Vorbild seines Freundes Jean-Marie Le Pen und war deren Vorsitzender. Zwei Mal - 1998 und 2002 - war Voridis Kandidat für das Amt des Athener Oberbürgermeisters. Die Elliniko Metopo verfügte über enge Verbindungen zur französischen Front National. Voridis, unterhielt persönliche Kontakte zu Le Pen und Carl Lang. Die gesamte Parteiführung wechselte im Herbst 2005 zur LA.O.S-Partei. Nach der Parlamentswahl 2007 war Voridis bis 2009 Abgeordneter für die erstmals im griechischen Parlament vertretene LA.O.S-Partei. In der Übergangsregierung Papadimos war er vom 11. November 2011 bis 17. Mai 2012 Minister für Infrastruktur, Verkehr und Netzwerke. Nach dem Ausscheiden der LA.O.S aus der Regierung im Februar 2012 trat er zur Nea Dimokratia über. Seit der Parlamentswahl im Mai 2012 war Voridis Abgeordneter der Nea Dimokratia und übernahm nach der Parlamentswahl im Juni 2012 den Fraktionsvorsitz. Vom 10. Juni 2014 bis 26. Januar 2015 war Voridis Gesundheitsminister im Kabinett Samaras.",

In opposition from 1996-1998, Foley was Shadow Attorney-General. When Labor won government under Peter Beattie in 1998, Foley was appointed Minister for the Arts, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. At the 2001 election, his seat was abolished and he successfully contested Yeerongpilly. Judge Roslyn Atkinson has credited Foley, in his role as Queensland Attorney-General, with making the Bench more inclusive and representative of wider society, and specifically appointing more women to the Bench.  After the election, he became Minister for Employment, Training and Youth, keeping his responsibility for the Arts but leaving his legal portfolios. Foley retired from politics in 2004.",

Strauss is also credited as a co-founder of European aerospace conglomerate Airbus. After the 1969 federal elections, West Germany's conservative alliance found itself out of power for the first time since the founding of the Federal Republic. At this time, Strauss became more identified with the regional politics of Bavaria. While he ran for the chancellorship as the candidate of the CDU/CSU in 1980, for the rest of his life Strauss never again held federal office. From 1978 until his death in 1988, he was the head of the Bavarian government. His last two decades were also marked by a fierce rivalry with CDU chairman Helmut Kohl.",

He served as chairman of the powerful Committee on Finance from March 4, 1913 to March 4, 1919. He was an unsuccessful contender for the 1920 Democratic Party nomination for president. As a leader of the state Democratic Party, Simmons led the 1898-1900 White Supremacy campaigns that effectively disfranchised black voters for a half-century. From his Senate seat, he then ran a powerful political machine, using A. D. Watts \"to keep the machine oiled back home,\" in the words of one journalist. Senator Simmons refused to endorse Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928. This, together with the Great Depression, led to Simmons being defeated in the 1930 Democratic primary by Josiah W. Bailey, who was backed by Governor O. Max Gardner.",

  "text" : "Frank Arthur Cooper (16 July 1872 – 30 November 1949) was Premier of Queensland from 1942 to 1946 for the Australian Labor Party. He was born on 16 July 1872 at Blayney, New South Wales, the son of an English miller and his Irish wife who had immigrated to Australia. Frank was educated in Sydney and worked as a clerk in various capacities around Sydney, including the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church and the Westinghouse brake company. In the latter capacity he moved to postings around the country before settling in Ipswich, Queensland where the main railway workshops for the State of Queensland were located. Cooper joined the Brisbane Clerical Union and became involved in Labor politics in Ipswich, including as president and secretary of the Ipswich Workers' Political Union, and was involved in the eight-hour day movement in provincial Queensland. His political activities, particularly his support for workers strikes in the state in 1912, caused him to run afoul of employer and he was dismissed, and Cooper subsequently became a journalist and activist within the Labor movement. He became editor of the Queensland Leader, a workers publication in Ipswich, in 1915 and remained so until 1925. In 1915 he was tapped to run for the seat of Bremer in the Queensland Parliament, a seat based in Ipswich which he would hold for the next three decades. In 1924 he became an alderman and eventually deputy-mayor for Ipswich City Council. In 1925 he married Agnes Hardy. Cooper had joined the first majority ALP government in Queensland under T. J. Ryan shortly after his election and became a prominent and well regarded member of the administration. Labor went back to opposition in 1929 but Cooper soon distinguished himself as an effective debater and parliamentarian. His reputation was such that he became Assistant Treasurer and Secretary for Public Instruction upon the election of William Forgan Smith as premier of a new ALP government in 1932. By 1938 Cooper was sitting on the Queensland ALP's central executive and was treasurer. He excelled in the position: that year he delivered the state's first budget surplus since 1927. He became deputy leader of the parliamentary party in September 1940, and played a key role in preparing Queensland's resources and mobilization for the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific. In 1942, the Federal ALP government under John Curtin introduced uniform taxation which ended the system of dual income taxes levied by both the states and the Commonwealth, instead making the Commonwealth the sole collector of income taxes with grants to be given back to the states to compensate for any losses. Many states, including Queensland, challenged the law in the High Court but were ultimately unsuccessful. Although William Forgan Smith accepted the decision he resigned soon after, and Cooper was duly elected to replace him as Premier of Queensland. Although now in his 70s, Cooper was an ardent supporter of the Commonwealth's prosecution of the war effort and worked with Curtin closely, sometimes invoking the ire of his own party in Queensland. Cooper continued in the premier role throughout the war, however at the war's end he stood down in favour of his Treasurer Ned Hanlon. In retirement he was active in the Anglican synod and on the senate of the University of Queensland, and died at his home in 1949. Cooper was accorded a State funeral which took place from St John's Cathedral to the Mount Thompson crematorium.",

  "text" : "Forbes George Vernon (21 August 1843 – 20 January 1911), Lieutenant (ret.) British Army, was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Canadian province of British Columbia from 1875 to 1882, and from 1886 to 1894, representing the riding of Yale. He ran for the constituency of Yale-East in 1894 following a redistribution, but was defeated by Donald Graham. Forbes George was the third of five sons born to John Edward Venables Vernon of Clontarf Castle in the north of Dublin, by his first wife Louisa Catherine Bowles. On 4 March 1863 Vernon wrote to the Colonial Office enquiring about land regulations in British Columbia, where free grants of up to 1,440 acres (6 km2) were available to military settlers with at least the rank of captain. He arrived in British Columbia the following September, with his elder brother Charles Albert Vernon (1840–1906) and their friend Charles Frederick Houghton. Vernon's original homestead of 160 acres (0.6 km2), near the city which bears his name, grew to become the 13,000 acre (53 km²) Coldstream Ranch, which he sold in 1891 to Lord Aberdeen. In 1876, he was named Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works in the provincial cabinet and served until 1878. He later served in the same cabinet post from 1887 to 1894. After retiring from politics, Vernon served as Agent General for the province of British Columbia in London from 1895 to 1899. He was married at Victoria 11 September 1877 to Katie Alma Branks of California; she died 31 March 1885 and was buried at Victoria. They had two daughters: Gladys Louise (1878–1892); and Beatrice Alma Ashley (1881–????), who went on to marry Captain Montague Furber. Vernon died in London in 1911. The northern Okanagan city of Vernon was named after him.",

  "text" : "Frances Ellen Bedford (born 5 November 1953) is an Australian politician, representing the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party in the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Florey since the 1997 election. Bedford was born in Sydney and moved to Melbourne and then Adelaide after the death of her mother. She became involved in politics and became an electorate officer for former Labor MP Peter Duncan. She was elected to State Parliament in the 1997 state election. Hailing from the Socialist Left faction of the Australian Labor Party, Bedford has described herself as being South Australia's most left-wing MP. Her support for the Relationships Bill 2005, a bill which extends legal protections to same-sex couples, has made her a target of fundamentalist groups. Her opinions are considered by some as being incompatible with the opinions of her 'bible belt' electorate. Despite this, she was returned at the 2006 state election with a swing of more than 10 points (two-party-preferred), exceeding the statewide swing to the Labor government and defeating her Liberal opponent Pat Trainor, a former pastor in the Assemblies of God. As of the 2014 state election, Bedford holds Florey with a margin of 2.5 points.",

In 1983 in a dispute about the use of volunteers in the ambulance service, as minister for Health, he publicly sided with the St. John Council who managed the ambulance service and two unions, the Ambulance Employees Association and the Miscellaneous Workers Association. John Cornwall, reflects that this position probably damaged his credibility at the time, with both unions and the Labor Party. Blevins was Treasurer of South Australia from 1992 to 1993. Prior to entering parliament he was a British merchant seaman and then a merchant seaman at Whyalla. He died at his home in 2013.",

  "text" : "George Edwin King (October 8, 1839 – May 7, 1901) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, second and fourth Premier of New Brunswick, and puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. King was born in Saint John, New Brunswick and attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he received a B.A. in 1859 and a M.A. in 1862. He then served under articles to a senior lawyer in Saint John, Robert Leonard Hazen, was made an attorney in 1863, and was called to the bar in 1865. King was elected to the first provincial legislature of the new Canadian Confederation in 1867 and served in the Confederation Party government as minister without portfolio. When Andrew R. Wetmore resigned, the Confederation Party became the Liberal-Conservatives and King became Premier in 1870. Some members of his caucus felt he was too close to the federal Conservatives of Sir John A. Macdonald and King was maneuvered out of the leadership by George L. Hathaway with King taking a position in the new cabinet. When Hathaway died in 1872, King became Premier for a second time serving until 1878. One of King's major accomplishments was the Common Schools Act of 1871 which implemented a single, tax supported public school system. As Attorney General, King appeared in the courts to defend the Act from constitutional challenges, including appearing before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire, in the case of Maher v. Town Council of Portland, which upheld the Act. In 1880 he became a justice on the province's supreme court, the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick, and in 1893 he became a justice on the Supreme Court of Canada. On his death in 1901, he was interred in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick.",

  "text" : "George Henry Williams (March 26, 1823 – April 4, 1910) was an American judge and politician. He served as Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon's U.S. Senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the Virginius, a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C. Gibbs United States District Attorney at Portland, Oregon. In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General under the controversy of his wife allegedly taking payment money from the custom house firm Pratt & Boyd in order to drop litigation by the U.S. Justice Department. After his resignation, Williams took part in counting Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes in settling the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland's mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams advocated women's suffrage and that marriage and divorce proceedings needed to be handled by the civil courts rather than the church. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted while Mayor of Portland for not enforcing gambling restriction statutes; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor. On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Williams was the second to last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration.",

  "text" : "Er wurde im preußischen Kadettenhaus erzogen, trat 1778 in den preußischen Militärdienst ein und machte als Fähnrich den bayrischen Erbfolgekrieg mit. Johann Erich Biester unterrichtete ihn in Griechisch und Latein. In sein Vaterland zurückgekehrt, wurde er 1782 in der Garde des Erbstatthalters Wilhelm V. angestellt, studierte aber später in Leiden Rechtswissenschaften, stand 1787 während der Unruhen auf oranischer Seite und wurde nach Unterdrückung derselben Pensionär (Stadtschreiber) von Rotterdam, von welchem Posten er nach der Eroberung Hollands durch die Franzosen 1795 zurücktrat, um in Amsterdam ein Kaufmannsgeschäft zu übernehmen. Durch seinen fehlgeschlagenen Plan, eine Kolonie für die Anhänger des Hauses Oranien am Kap der Guten Hoffnung zu gründen, büßte er den größten Teil seines Vermögens ein; dagegen trug er 1813 wesentlich zur Befreiung Hollands vom französischen Okkupation bei, indem er, als die Verbündeten siegreich vordrangen, die Anhänger des Prinzen von Oranien in Den Haag vereinigte. Als Präsident der Kommission, welche mit der Entwerfung der neuen Verfassungsurkunde beauftragt war, übte er einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die übrigen Kommissionsmitglieder aus, so dass er der Haupturheber des niederländischen Staatsgrundgesetzes war. Darauf erhielt er das Departement der auswärtigen Angelegenheiten, wurde Vizepräsident des Staatsrats und 1815 Graf, nahm aber schon 1816 wegen Kränklichkeit seine Entlassung. Als Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Generalstaaten, in die er 1815 gewählt worden war, gehörte er zur Opposition gegen den Minister van Maanen. Auf seinen Platz in der Ersten Kammer verzichtete er, weil die Verhandlungen derselben nicht öffentlich waren. Er war vom 20. September 1815 bis 22. Mai 1819 Staatsminister der Niederlande, wurde dann aber wegen Kritik an der Finanzpolitik Wilhelm I. der Niederlande dieses Titels enthoben. Er ist einer von nur sechs niederländischen Staatsministern bei denen das der Fall war. Er starb am 5. August 1834 im Haag. Er schrieb: \"Über den Handel nach Indien\" (1801, 2 Bde.), \"Memoiren über den Handel nach Java\" (1804), \"Beiträge zur Staatshaushaltung des Königreichs der Niederlande\" (Delft 1818-29, 10 Bde.; 2. Aufl., hrsg. von Thorbecke, Zaltbommel 1854-56, 5 Bde.), sämtlich in holländischer Sprache; \"Lettres sur la prospérité publique\" (Amsterd. 1830, 2 Bde.); \"La séparation de la Hollande et de la Belgique\" (das.. 1830) u. a.",

However, he was an alcoholic and womaniser. During these bouts, he provided secret information about their activities to the British. Hence, he was dismissed from the village by Raju. He took shelter in the house of his lover in 1923. During this time, the British arrested him and prosecuted him with the death sentence. On his appeal, the death sentence was changed in 1924 to life imprisonment at Andaman Jail. He was released in 1937 on the perusal of Congress politicians. In this way, he became the only associate of Raju to survive the British assault. He was elected to the 1st Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam constituency in 1952 as Independent candidate along with Lanka Sundaram.",

  "text" : "George Kerr (1853–1930) was an Australian politician, grazier, and blacksmith. He was born on 7 February 1853 at Beadnell, Northumberland, England and after training to become a blacksmith moved to Queensland in 1877. He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.",

  "text" : "Paul Dundes Wolfowitz (born December 22, 1943) is a former President of the World Bank, United States Ambassador to Indonesia, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, and former dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, working on issues of international economic development, Africa and public-private partnerships, and chairman of the US-Taiwan Business Council. He is considered to be a leading neoconservative. However, Wolfowitz rejects the term and prefers to call himself a \"Scoop Jackson Republican,\" after Democratic U.S. senator Henry M. Jackson who was known for his hawkish views on foreign policy. After serving two years, he resigned as president of the World Bank Group due to scandals described by a Reuters report as \"a protracted battle over his stewardship, prompted by his involvement in a high-paying promotion for his companion\". He was reportedly the model for a minor character named Philip Gorman in Saul Bellow's 2001 book Ravelstein.",

A member of the Australian Labor Party, he was elected as the member for Gaven in the 2006 state election, defeating National Party member Alex Douglas, who had won the seat against Gray in a by-election earlier that year. In late 2008, Gray earned himself some bad publicity when he was accused of two separate instances of \"bullying\", both of them against elderly women. In the first instance he threaten to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray was forced to publicly apologise for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time. On this occasion, Douglas, running under the banner of the newly formed Liberal National Party, narrowly emerged as the victor. Following his defeat, Gray angrily slammed what he perceived as negative and \"biased\" coverage of him by the Gold Coast Bulletin.",

His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands. On May 25, 1870 he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court.",

He entered politics as one of the six MHAs for Bass in April 1909, and almost immediately became attorney-general and minister for education in the Elliott Lewis second and third ministries, taking the additional position of minister of mines in October 1909. When Lewis retired in June 1912 Solomon became premier, attorney-general and minister of education, but he had a bare majority of one and it required much tact and finesse to keep the ministry going until April 1914. Attention was given to education and considerable additions were made to the number of state and high schools. Never a robust man, Solomon felt the strain of office – his health broke down, and he died at Hobart aged 38 on 5 October 1914. He was survived by his wife and two sons. He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church and a temperance reformer.",
