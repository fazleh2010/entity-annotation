  "text" : "Michael \"Mike\" Huebsch is a Republican politician and former legislator from Wisconsin. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Huebsch graduated from Onalaska High School and attended Oral Roberts University. He served in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1995 through 2011. From 2007 to 2009, he served as Speaker of the Assembly. Huebsch, his wife, and family live in West Salem, Wisconsin. While in the State Assembly, he and fellow Republican representative and future governor Scott Walker were involved in the \"Wisconsin witch hunt\" in 2001â€“02, in which they attempted to terminate the employment of state employee Jamyl Witch because of her beliefs as a Wiccan. Walker claimed that Witch's hiring as a prison chaplain raised \"both personal and political concerns\" because she \"practice[d] a religion that actually offends people of many other faiths\". Huebsch likewise said that \"Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus,\" proposing to delete the state appropriation which funded Witch's position, although in the past he had repeatedly advocated increasing state funding for prison chaplains. Walker and Huebsch were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating Witch's employment. Huebsch resigned from the Assembly after Walker, now Governor-elect, appointed Huebsch as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration on December 30, 2010. In a special election on May 3, 2011, the District 94 Assembly seat he had held for eight terms went to Democrat Steve Doyle. In early 2015 Huebsch was moved to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. His position as Secretary of Administration is now held by Scott Neitzel. Huebsch will serve six years as is one of three commissioners.",
