He then represented the Napier electorate from 1884 to 1890, when he retired. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 20 January 1891 and served until his death on 6 October 1917. He was appointed to the Council as one of seven new members (including Harry Atkinson himself) appointed to the Council by the outgoing fourth Atkinson Ministry; a move regarded by Liberals as a stacking of the upper house against the new government. Ormond was baptised on 28 June 1831. He came from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, (then Berkshire), England, and established a homestead called Wallingford in Central Hawke's Bay in 1847, which became a major farming station. Businessman and farmer Sir John Ormond, politician and farmer Tiaki Omana, and politician and Historic Places Trust chairman Ormond Wilson were his grandsons. His brother-in-law and husband of his sister was the Governor of Jamaica, Edward John Eyre. His second great-granddaughter is the Headmistress, Ormond Felicity Lusk. He married Hannah Richardson on 4 December 1860, the sister of George Edward Gordon Richardson. He died on 6 October 1917 at his home 'Tintagel' in Napier.",

He married Eleanor Blanche Mary Lewis in Auckland on 4 November 1882. He represented the Auckland electorate of Eden from 1876 general election (held on 6 January) until 1887, when he contested the Newton electorate. The two other candidates were Edward Withy (a political novice who, after early retirement from business, had emigrated with his large family to Auckland in 1884) and Henry Thomas Garrett. Tole and Garrett were liberal politicians, whilst Withy was a conservative. The liberal vote was split, and Tole, Withy and Garrett received 606, 701 and 170 votes, respectively, with Withy thus elected. In 1893, he became Crown Prosecutor at Auckland and remained in that role until his death. He became a King's Counsel in 1907. His death on 13 December 1920 came suddenly.",

Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875.

His father's family were publishers to the University of Edinburgh. After receiving a good education, McGlashan worked in the book trade. Inspired by his brother's work as secretary for the Otago Association, he decided to emigrate and left in 1848. He went to Adelaide in South Australia, then Melbourne and finally Sydney, where he sold the books that he took with him for a good profit. There, he purchased provisions that he took with himself to Dunedin in 1850, which he could once again sell at a good profit. In 1853, he was joined in Dunedin by his older brother, John McGlashan. Edward McGlashan worked at first as a registrar at the Supreme Court under Justice Sidney Stephen. He then leased a flour mill from William Henry Valpy on the Water of Leith. He also had a store and auction room in Princes Street. From 1858 until 1862, when the Otago Gold Rush began, he was in partnership with W. Carr Young, and they traded as Young and McGlashan. McGlashan visited England in 1862. Edward McGlashan stood for election in the first Otago Provincial Council, and represented the Dunedin Country electorate from 28 September 1853 to 15 September 1855. He was unsuccessful at some later provincial elections. In 1865, he contested the superintendancy, but was beaten by Thomas Dick. He would later represent the North Harbour electorate in the 6th and 7th council, from 17 March 1871 until the abolition of the provincial governments on 31 October 1876. He represented the City of Dunedin electorate from the 1860 general election to 1862 when he resigned; and then the Roslyn electorate from the 1871 general election to 1875, when he resigned. McGlashan had various business interests later in life. He dealt in stock and farmland, and owned Mount Stokes station. He owned steamers and was milling in The Catlins. He started to manufacture paper, but was unsuccessful in making it from tussock grasses. He moved to Timaru for some years and was a director of a number of companies, including a major shareholder in the New Zealand Shipping Company. After a long visit to England from 1881, he returned to Dunedin to live in St Clair. McGlashan married twice, and his second wife was Henrietta, the daughter of George Bell; they married on 10 March 1880. McGlashan's health was poor for his last few years. He died on 31 July 1889 at his residence in St Clair, and was survived by his second wife.",

Barff was born in the English county of Kent on 5 March 1833, probably at Lee (now part of Greater London), where he was baptised five months later. He first came to New Zealand to join the West Coast Gold Rush in the mid-1860s. The West Coast was initially part of the Canterbury Province and following a requisition in October 1865, he was first elected as the member of the West Coast Goldfields electorate in the following month. Barff and Evan Prosser, who was elected at the same time, were the first members from the West Coast on the Canterbury Provincial Council. In July 1866, Barff became a member for the Westland electorate. He remained a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council until December 1867. The Westland district separated from the Canterbury Province on 1 January 1868, and Barff joined the Westland County, which was the predecessor to Westland Province. During the existence of Westland County (January 1868 – November 1873), Barff represented the ridings of Westland, Ōkārito, and Arahura. He did not join the Westland Provincial Council, but stood for the first election in January 1874 as one of three candidates in the two-member Arahura electorate (incorrectly referred to as 'Waimea' in some sources). Much to his surprise, he was defeated with 120 votes by Richard Seddon and Houlahan, who were equal at 145 votes. He represented the Westland South electorate in the House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870, when he was defeated for Hokitika by John White. He then represented the Hokitika electorate from 1876 to 1879, when he was again defeated. Barff died in Kumara in 1882; he had never married.",

He was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council on 30 April 1878, and served until he died. In 1893 Reynolds was at the centre of a drama that led to the passing of the Women's suffrage bill into law. Premier Seddon had expected to stop the bill in the upper house, but found that one more vote was needed. Thomas Kelly, a new Liberal Party councillor had left himself paired in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon's manipulation so incensed two opposition councillors, Reynolds and Edward Cephas John Stevens that they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 and so gave the vote to women. Reynolds married Rachel Pinkerton in 1856 and together raised nine children.",

The half brother Allan Kerr Taylor lived in Mount Albert in a house called Alberton; it is possibly to differentiate themselves from the main part of the family that the Mt Albert Talyors adopted Allan's middle name as part of their surname - becoming the Kerr Taylors or Kerr-Taylors. This may well have simply grown out of the social conventions of the period. Charles John Taylor served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament and the 2nd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Southern Division; (consisting of the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and East Cape regions). He resigned on 13 April 1858. From the 1861 election, he served in the 3rd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Raglan electorate. He resigned from Raglan before the end of that term on 1 April 1865. His election statement for the 1861 election read, \"Having always held opinions opposed to a centralising policy, I should vote for the repeal of the \"New Provinces Act.” I am prepared to unite with the other representatives of this province in obtaining a sweeping reduction in the expenditure now lavished on an overgrown and daily increasing official staff, and to act in concert with those gentlemen that Auckland may hold the prominent position due to her in the government of the colony.\" In that election he defeated Theodore Haultain. He represented the Southern Division electorate on the 3rd Auckland Provincial Council from 26 October 1860 to 12 September 1861. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 31 March 1869.

Premier Seddon had expected to stop the bill in the upper house, but found that one more vote was needed. Kelly had left himself paired in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon’s manipulation so incensed two opposition councillors William Hunter Reynolds and Edward Cephas John Stevens that they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 and so gave the vote to women.

He unsuccessfully contested the Western Maori electorate in the 1884 election. Of eight candidates, he came fifth with 9.7% of the vote. In the 1886 by-election, he came third out of five candidates. In the 1896 election, he defeated Ropata Te Ao, and he held the Western Maori electorate to 1911 when he was defeated by Māui Pōmare. Wilson notes him as a Reform Party supporter. Kaihau does, however, appear on a poster of the Liberal Party in 1910. The New Zealand Herald, in its 1905 election reporting, also lists him as a government supporter, i.e. a Liberal. Those newspapers that listed political affiliation for Maori candidates for the 1908 election, The Star (Christchurch) and The Tuapeka Times, also show him as a supporter of the Ward Ministry.",

Taiaroa then held the electorate from 1881 to 1885 when he was again appointed to the Legislative Council, where he served for 20 years until his death.

September zeichnete ihn der ukrainische Ministerpräsident Arsenij Jazenjuk mit dem Bogdan-Chmelnizki-Orden dritter Klasse aus. Bei dieser Gelegenheit wurden in ukrainischen Medien erstmals Bilder von Sementschenko veröffentlicht, die ihn ohne Maske zeigen, in einer Fernsehsendung im September 2014 erklärte er, sein bürgerlicher Name sei Konstantin Grischin. Er sei 1974 auf der Krim geboren und habe in Moskau Film studiert. Seit den 1990er Jahren habe er für „einen sehr wohlhabenden Mann in Donezk gearbeitet“. Sementschenko führte im September 2014 in Washington, D.C. Gespräche mit US-Politikern und mit Rüstungsherstellern, laut dem Tagesspiegel schrieb er hierzu auf seiner Facebook-Seite: Bei der Parlamentswahl in der Ukraine 2014 kandidierte Sementschenko auf dem zweiten Platz der Liste der Partei Samopomitsch und wurde in die Werchowna Rada gewählt. 2015/2016 kandidierte Sementschenko als Bürgermeister der zentralukrainischen Stadt Krywyj Rih, verlor aber mit lediglich 11 % der Stimmen gegen Jurij Wilkul vom Oppositionsblock (73 %).",

In 2014, Tomenko became a member of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc, which elected him to the 8th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada on its party lists during the 2014 parliamentary election. On 25 March 2016 the party Congress of Petro Poroshenko Bloc removed Tomenko's parliamentary mandate using the Imperative mandate provisions of the Ukrainian constitution. This was considered illegal by Tomenko; on 28 July 2016 Ukraine's higest Administrative Court rejected his apeal to gain back his parliamentary seat. Tomenko is a centre-right politician, previously a member of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. He was also one of the leaders and most notable speakers of the Orange Revolution. In 2005, Tomenko served as Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine in the Cabinet of Yulia Tymoshenko (coordinating humanitarian policy). In the Verkhovna Rada, he also served as the Chairman of the Freedom of Speech and Mass Media Committee and twice as the Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (during the 6th and 7th convocations). Tomenko tendered his resignation as deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada on 4 July 2012 as a sign of protest against the way legislation on languages in Ukraine was passed on 3 July 2012.",

Membre de l’iwi (tribu) Te Ati Haunui-a-Paparangi dans la région de Wanganui, il s'implique dans les années 1850 dans les médiations pour ramener la paix dans cette région affectée par de violents conflits territoriaux inter-tribaux. Dans le même temps il participe à des réunions du mouvement Kingitanga, mais pour y exprimer son opposition au mouvement : le Kingitanga affirme son indépendance vis-à-vis des autorités coloniales, tandis que Mete Paetahi est partisan de la souveraineté britannique en Nouvelle-Zélande. Il s'oppose aussi au soulèvement de la secte Pai Marire dans les années 1860, et se joint aux forces maori pro-britanniques qui le combattent. Il prend part à la bataille de Moutoa le 14 mai 1864. Il fournit au gouvernement colonial d'importantes recommandations tactiques dans le conflit, et participe à la bataille d'Ohoutahi en février 1865, puis à l'expédition militaire des forces gouvernementales dans le Taranaki en janvier et février 1866. En 1868 se tiennent les premières élections pour des sièges réservés aux Maori à la Chambre des représentants. Seul candidat dans la circonscription couvrant l'ouest du pays, Paetahi est déclaré élu. Un mois après son entrée au Parlement en mai, les forces coloniales font à nouveau face à une résistance maori armée : l’iwi Ngati Ruanui, sous son chef Titokowaru, se soulève en réponse à des confiscations de terres. Mete Paetahi, s'exprimant au Parlement, incite le gouvernement à répondre avec fermeté, soulignant les exactions commises par les rebelles. La même année, il succède au statut de chef de plus haut rang des tribus du sud du Wanganui. Il perd son siège de député aux élections de 1871. Il ne participe dès lors plus à la vie politique coloniale, mais prend part dans les années 1870 à des réunions inter-tribales maori pour discuter de la représentation politique des Maori, et de l'attitude à adopter sur la question des terres. Il est généralement favorable à l'idée de vendre des terres aux colons, tant que les tribus en conservent suffisamment pour vivre. Il se consacre par ailleurs à l'élevage de moutons qu'il acquiert en 1877. Il meurt à l'âge d'environ 70 ans, et les autorités coloniales l'honorent de funérailles militaires, en reconnaissance de ses services durant les Guerres maories.",

Graham was born in 1812; sources differ whether his birthplace was in Hove, East Sussex or at Frogmore in Berkshire, England. He belonged to Clan Graham, and his grandfather was an interpreter between the Scottish and the English. He became clerk of works with the Board of Ordnance aged 19, and belonged to the Royal Engineers for the next 25 years. He was posted to Ireland in 1835, to New South Wales in 1836, and to New Zealand in 1840. He worked for the Royal Engineers and was involved in public works, roading, and military installations. The Flagstaff War in the Bay of Islands in 1845–46 put a scare to the population of Auckland, and Graham supervised the enlargement of the Albert Barracks overlooking the town. He later claimed that the fortification of the barracks was not necessary, but by doing so, it would prevent the subdivision of the hill and that the area could thus later become a park. Indeed, Albert Park was formed in the 1880s. Graham was then sent to China, where he suffered a nervous breakdown after witnessing a fellow soldier being buried alive. He resigned from the military and returned to New Zealand, where he took up farming in Māngere. He represented the Newton electorate from 1861 to 1869, when he resigned. Graham retired to Hove in England for the last years of his life. He died at Hove on 14 February 1901. His son James Bannatyne Graham married Elizabeth Mary Josephine Sheehan, the sister of cabinet minister John Sheehan. Their son was George Samuel Graham.",

Four candidates were nominated: Morris; William Kelly, who had also previously represented the East Coast electorate; George Vesey Stewart, then the owner of the Bay of Plenty Times; and Henry Thomas Rowe, a surveyor and commission agent. Rowe announced his retirement from the contest on 6 December three days out from election day, urging his supporters to vote for Stewart instead. The unofficial results were released the day after the election (Saturday, 10 December) and Morris had a majority of 13 votes over Stewart, with the official declaration to be made on 12 December. This was deferred until 14 December, with Morris ahead by 10 votes. Stewart stood for the Tauranga mayoralty a few months later and was elected the town's first mayor.

  "text" : "Andrij Wolodymyrowytsch Parubij (ukrainisch Андрій Володимирович Парубій; * 31. Januar 1971 in Tscherwonohrad) ist ein ukrainischer Politiker (parteilos; ehemals Allukrainische Vereinigung „Vaterland“). Parubij war vom 27. Februar bis 7. August 2014 Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrats der Ukraine. Er war Mitbegründer der rechtsextremen Sozial-Nationalen Partei der Ukraine, des Vorläufers der heutigen Swoboda-Partei und war zeitweise auch in der Führung der nationalistischen Organisation Patriot der Ukraine aktiv. In seiner politischen Laufbahn wechselte er mehrfach die Parteizugehörigkeit, bei den Parlamentswahlen 2012 kandidierte er auf der Liste von Julija Tymoschenkos Vaterlandspartei und wurde erneut in die Werchowna Rada gewählt. Während der Euromaidan-Proteste galt Parubij als „Kommandeur des Maidan“, wobei er eng mit dem Führer des Rechten Sektors, Dmytro Jarosch, kooperierte. Bei der Bildung der Übergangsregierung Jazenjuk im Februar 2014 erhielt Parubij das Amt des Vorsitzenden des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates der Ukraine, von dem er am 7. August 2014 zurücktrat. Während der Krise in der Ukraine 2014 leitete er von April bis August, als der Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates, die Operationen im Osten der Ukraine, die als „Anti-Terror-Operation“ bezeichnet wurden. Während dieser Zeit sprach sich Parubij für die Einführung einer Visumpflicht für russische Staatsbürger aus. Jazenjuk nahm gegenüber der Frage der Visa-Regelung in Brüssel eine vorsichtigere Haltung an, angesichts der Tatsache, dass eine große Zahl der Bürger, in erster Linie im Süden und Osten des Landes, interessiert seien an der Beibehaltung des visumfreien Verkehrs nach Russland, da sie dort arbeiten oder Familie hätten. Bei der Parlamentswahl 2014 kandidiert er auf Platz vier der Volksfront. Nach der Wahl wurde er stellvertretender Parlamentsvorsitzender der Werchowna Rada. Am 14. April 2016 wurde Andrij Parubij in Nachfolge des neuen Ministerpräsidenten Wolodymyr Hrojsman mit 284 Abgeordnetenstimmen zum neuen Parlamentspräsidenten der Werchowna Rada gewählt.",
