  "text" : "Tan Sri Tengku Razaleigh bin Tengku Mohd Hamzah (born 13 April 1937) is a Malaysian Member of Parliament and a senior political figure from the state of Kelantan. He is dubbed the Father of Malaysia's Economy for playing a pivotal role in establishing and implementing key foundations and policies in Malaysia's economy. A descendant of Malay royalty, he is the uncle of the current Raja Perempuan (Queen) of Kelantan; Tengku is a Malay hereditary title usually translated as \"Prince\". He was the Minister of Finance (1976–1984), Minister of International Trade and Industry (1984–1987), former chairman of Asian Development Bank, former chairman of Islamic Development Bank, founding Chairman and Chief Executive of Malaysian oil company, PETRONAS, and chairman of the 33rd Annual Meetings of the Board of Governors of the World Bank and IMF. He is now the longest serving member of parliament in Malaysia. His popularity has earned him nicknames such as \"People's Prince\" and \"Ku Kita\" (Our Tengku). He is affectionately known as Ku Li, derived from the last syllables of Tengku Razaleigh; deriving a nickname from the first syllables of one's name is a common custom in the Kelantan dialect.",
