Benson's running mate for governor was former state House minority leader Ethan Berkowitz; they lost in the general election to the Republican ticket of Sean Parnell and Mead Treadwell by 22% of the vote. In March 2007, Benson filed in Alaska to make her second bid for the U.S. House of Representatives, but was defeated in the August 2008 Democratic primary by Ethan Berkowitz--the same person with whom she ran on the 2010 governor-lieutenant governor ticket--who was that year a \"Red to Blue\" candidate supported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Benson ran for Alaska governor in 2002 and for the U.S. House in 2006.",

  "text" : "Mike Berryhill is a farmer, agricultural and public official from Ceres, California. He was the Republican nominee for Congress from California's 18th congressional district in the 2010 general election. The election pit Berryhill against 4-term Democratic Representative Dennis Cardoza. While the 18th district leans only slightly Democratic, having a Cook PVI D+4, Cardoza only faced serious competition in 2002, when he was first elected to the seat. This race is considered competitive in 2010 because of Mike's experience in local agriculture, his family name, and the current political climate. Berryhill comes from a Republican political family that's well known in the San Joaquin Valley. Mike’s Uncle, Clare Berryhill, served in both houses of the California State Legislature and also served as director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture under Governor George Deukmejian. His first cousins, Tom and Bill Berryhill, currently represent the 25th and 26th districts, respectively, in the California State Assembly. Mike was president of Young Farmers and Ranchers of California and elected to the Turlock Irrigation District Board. He also served several decades on the Ceres School Board, and, in 2005, Berryhill Elementary School was named in honor of Mike and other members of the Berryhill family who served on the school board.",
