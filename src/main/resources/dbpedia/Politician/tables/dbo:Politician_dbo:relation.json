  "text" : "John Jeremy Thorpe, PC (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the Liberal Party between 1967 and 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, based on his earlier relationship with Norman Scott, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and the furore surrounding it, ended his political career. Thorpe was the son and grandson of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with neither of the main parties attaining a majority (\"Hung parliament\"), Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government. The February 1974 election proved to be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence on the grounds that the prosecution had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.",

De Witt controlled the Netherlands political system from around 1650 until shortly before his death in 1672 working with various factions from nearly all the major cities, especially his hometown, Dordrecht, and the city of birth of his wife, Amsterdam. As a republican he opposed the House of Orange. He was also strongly liberal, preferring lesser power to the central government and more power to the regenten. However, his negligence of the Dutch land army (as the regents focused only on merchant vessels, thinking they could avoid war) proved disastrous when the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar. In the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of three countries, he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague.",

  "text" : "John Douglas (6 mars 1828 - 23 juillet 1904) était un homme politique australien d'origine britannique et le septième premier ministre du Queensland. Douglas est né à Londres. Il était le septième fils d'Henry Alexander Douglas et d'Elizabeth Dalzell, son épouse. Ses parents sont morts en 1837 et il a fait ses études à Harrow et à l'Université de Durham, où il a également obtenu son baccalauréat en arts en 1850. On raconte qu'il a fait ses études à Rugby School mais son nom ne figure pas dans la liste de l'école de son époque. Il est arrivé en Nouvelle-Galles du Sud en 1851 et a été nommé commissaire des mines d'or, mais il démissionna pour devenir fermier. Il fut ensuite élu député de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud dans la circonscription de Darling Downs puis de Camden avant de démissionner le 17 juillet 1861. Il s'installa au Queensland en 1863 et fut élu député de Port Curtis. Le 1er mars 1866, il devint Postmaster General dans le premier gouvernement d'Arthur Macalister. Il fut nommé par la suite sénateur mais fut élu par la suite député de la nouvelle circonscription des Downs est. Il obtint le portefeuille de ministre des finances dans le second gouvernement Macalister en décembre 1866, puis en mai 1867, celui de ministre des travaux publics. Il redevint postmaster general dans le gouvernement de Charles Lilley de décembre 1868 jusqu'en novembre 1869, date à laquelle il démissionna pour devenir agent-général (ambassadeur) pour le Queensland à Londres. En 1871, il retourna au Queensland et devint député de Maryborough lors des élections de 1875. Il fut nommé ministre des terres publiques dans le gouvernement de George Thorn de juin 1876 jusqu'en mars 1877, lorsqu'il devint premier ministre. Son parti fut battu lors des élections de janvier 1879 et Douglas abandonna la politique. Il fut pendant un certain temps dans la direction du Brisbane Courier, et en 1885 le gouvernement le nomma magistrat résident de l'île Thursday. Après le décès de Sir Peter Scratchley en décembre 1885, il devint commissaire spécial pour le protectorat britannique de Nouvelle-Guinée pendant presque trois ans, et montra ses capacités de tact dans ses rapports avec les populations locales. En 1889, il revint à son ancien poste sur l'île Thursday. Il se rendit en Angleterre en 1902 et à son retour, continua son œuvre jusqu'à sa mort dans l'île. Douglas a été marié deux fois, d'abord à Marie, la fille de J. Simpson, en 1861 puis, en 1877, à Sarah, la fille de Michael Hickey. Il eut quatre fils de son deuxième mariage, dont deux ont eu une carrière distinguée. Le plus jeune, Robert Johnstone Douglas, (1883-1972), a été nommé juge de la cour suprême du Queensland en 1923 et l'aîné, Edward Archibald Douglas, (1877-1947), a été nommé à un poste similaire, en mars 1929. Alex Douglas, le nouveau député de Gaven est son arrière-petit-fils.",

  "text" : "Evald Rygh (* 26. Mai 1842 in Verdal; † 9. Mai 1913 in Christiania) war ein norwegischer Beamter und Politiker. Seine Eltern waren der Bauer, Lehensmann und Stortingsabgeordnete Peder Strand Rygh (1800–1868) und dessen Frau Ingeborg Marie Bentsen (1809–1878). Am 10. November 1870 heiratete er Sophie Arntzen (26. Dezember 1842–19. Mai 1913), Tochter des Stiftamtmanns Karelius August Arntzen (1802–1875) und dessen Frau Hanna Maria Gjerdrumine Arntzen (1808–1869). Sein Bruder war Oluf Rygh, ein zeitweiliges Mitglied von Det lærde Holland. Rygh studierte Rechtswissenschaften und legte 1864 sein Examen ab. In dieser Zeit traf er die Mitglieder des Studentenkreises „Det lærde Holland“ und betätigte sich auch als Verfasser verschiedener Zeitungsartikel. 1865 trat er eine Stelle im Finanzdepartement an. 1866 bis 1867 erhielt er ein Universitätsstipendium für ein Studium der Volkswirtschaft in Großbritannien und Frankreich. Von dort schrieb er auch Artikel über die französische Politik für das Morgenblad. Danach kehrte er auf seine Stelle im Finanzdepartement zurück, wo er 1869 Abteilungsleiter und 1872 Ekspedisjonssekretær wurde. 1875 wurde er in das „Formandsskab“ von Christiania gewählt und war 1892 bis 1893 Ordfører. 1879 erhielt er ein Angebot, in die Regierung von Frederik Stang einzutreten, das er aber ausschlug, weil er deren Auffassung in der Frage der Zulassung der Staatsräte zu den Stortingsverhandlungen nicht teilte. 1880 bis 1893 war er Bürgermeister von Christiania. Zu dieser Zeit war er auch in verschiedenen Ämtern, die sich mit dem Eisenbahnwesen befassten, tätig. 1882 wirkte er auch am Entwurf eines Nachbarrechtsgesetzes mit. Nach 1884 engagierte er sich stärker in der Politik und hing dem moderaten Flügel der „Høyre“ (der Rechten) an. 1889 bis 1891 war er Finanzminister in der ersten Regierung von Emil Stang. 1893 wurde er Direktor der „Christiania Sparebank“, eine Stellung, die er bis zu seinem Tode behielt. Bis 1893 war er auch Mitglied der Direktion der „Kristiania Hypotek- og Realkreditbank“, die er 1886 mitgegründet hatte. Er war von 1886 bis 1888 und von 1889 bis 1891 stellvertretender Delegierter und von 1892 bis 1894 Delegierter für Christiania im Storting. 1894 wurde er Vorsitzender des Vorstandes von „Selskabet for Norges Vel“. 1895 bis 1896 war er auch Vorsitzender des Komitees, das mit Schweden ein neues Handelsabkommen (Mellemrigslov) erarbeitete, dessen Entwurf im Wesentlichen auf ihn zurückgeht. 1885 sorgte er für die Gründung der „Christiania Telefonselskab“, der er dann vorstand. Als Emil Stang seine zweite Regierung bildete, war Rygh als Finanzminister begehrt. Aber trotz des Druckes auf ihn, dieses Amt zu übernehmen, schlug er diese Stellung aus. Das wurde sein Abschied aus der Politik. Er befasste sich nun in erster Linie mit der Leitung der Bank und übernahm verschiedene Leitungsfunktionen in Organisationen und Institutionen mit kulturellen und sozialen Aufgaben. So war er Vorsitzender des Vereins zur Errichtung eines Nationaltheaters und nach 1899 Direktor des Theaters. Er sorgte auch für das Erholungsgebiet in der Gegend von Holmenkollen-Voksenkollen. Deshalb steht in der Nähe der Wintersportanlage Holmenkollen seine Büste als Denkmal. Auch zwei Straßen wurden nach ihm benannt. Rygh wurde 1878 Ritter 1. Klasse des Sankt-Olav-Ordens und 1891 dessen Kommandeur 1. Klasse.",

  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Channing Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the 1884 election. Jessie Buckland was his son John's daughter.",

He received the proprietorship after the death of his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (15 April 1632), for whom it had been intended. Cecil Calvert established and managed the Province of Maryland from his home, Kiplin Hall, in North Yorkshire, England. As an English Roman Catholic, he continued the legacy of his father by promoting religious tolerance in the colony. Maryland became a haven for Catholics in the New World, particularly important at a time of religious persecution in England. Calvert governed Maryland for forty-two years. He also continued to be Lord Proprietor and Governor of Newfoundland for the colony of Avalon. He died in England on 30 November 1675, aged 70 years. He is thought to be buried at St. Giles-in-the-Fields Church, London, UK. The exact location of his grave is unknown, but parish records state he is buried there. A plaque commemorating Cecil Calvert was placed in St. Giles in 1996 by the Governor of Maryland. However, genealogists for Kiplin Hall state, \"A number of the early Calverts were buried at St Giles in the Fields, Charing Cross Road, London. We cannot yet be certain whether Cecil is one of them.\" This is possibly due to poor record keeping of Catholic burials or numerous outbreaks of disease that overwhelmed burial staff and led to confusion in parish registers .",

He had been his father's Deputy Governor since 1661 when he arrived in the colony at the age of 24. However, Charles left Maryland for England in 1684 and would never return. The events following the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688 would cost Calvert his title to Maryland; in 1689 the royal charter to the colony was withdrawn, leading to direct rule by the British Crown. Calvert's political problems were largely caused by his Roman Catholic faith which was at odds with the established Church of England. Calvert married four times, outliving three wives, and had at least two children. He died in England in 1715 at the age of 78, his family fortunes much diminished. With his death he passed his title, and his claim to Maryland, to his second son Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (1679–1715), his eldest son Cecil having died young. However, Benedict Calvert would outlive his father by just two months, and It would fall to Charles' grandson, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, (1699–1751), (who converted to the Anglican faith) to see the family proprietorship in Maryland restored by the king.",

Religious tension, which had been a source of great division in the colony, was much reduced under his governorship.

The 3rd Lord Baltimore was a devout Roman Catholic, and had lost his title to the Province of Maryland shortly after the events of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which saw the Protestant monarchs William and Mary accede to the British throne. Benedict Calvert would make strenuous attempts to have his family's title to Maryland restored by renouncing Roman Catholicism and joining the Church of England. In February 1715 Benedict became the 4th Baron Baltimore upon the death of his father, and he immediately petitioned King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore died aged 36, outliving his father by just two months. Shortly afterwards the King restored the title to Maryland to Calvert's young son Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.",

Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony.

He was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election, and was re-elected to his council seat twice. His political career, particularly his mayoralty, saw a number of personal and work-related controversies and legal proceedings. In 2013, he became embroiled in a substance abuse scandal, which was widely reported in the national and international media. Following his admission, Ford refused to resign, but City Council handed over certain mayoral powers and office staff to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. Despite the scandal, Ford initially contested the next mayoral election, scheduled for October 2014, but after being hospitalized and diagnosed with an abdominal tumour in September 2014, Ford withdrew from the mayoral race and registered instead to run for his old city council seat. John Tory succeeded him as mayor on December 1, 2014, while Ford regained his former seat. Ford received treatment for the cancer, and was able to return to City Hall for a while, but died in March 2016 after chemotherapy was ineffective.",

He went on to study law and was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1861. In that same year, he married Emily Myers Wetmore. He served as a school trustee for several years and was clerk for the Westmorland County court from 1867 to 1870. Hanington ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial legislature for Westmorland in 1870 but was elected in an 1870 by-election as a Liberal-Conservative. He was defeated in 1874 then regained his seat in 1878 and entered the cabinet of Premier John James Fraser as minister without portfolio and succeeded Fraser as premier in 1882. Hanington was sympathetic to Acadian rights and appointed a member of that community, Pierre-Amand Landry, to the senior cabinet position of provincial secretary. However, Hanington faced a leader of the opposition, Andrew G. Blair who had organised the Liberal Party into a powerful force. In 1883, Blair defeated Hanington's Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence and won the subsequent election. Hanington continued as leader of the opposition but was unable to defeat Blair's Liberals in the 1886 election. He remained in the legislature until 1896 when he accepted an appointment to the bench as a member of the province's Supreme Court. He was the presiding judge at the last trial of Tom Collins.",

He served in the Ontario Legislature from 1902 to 1905, and was the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1911 to 1916. Cameron was born in Hawkesbury, Canada West (now Ontario), and was educated at Vankleek Hill High School. He did not attend college. Cameron moved to Manitoba in 1878, and worked as a contractor at Brandon. Cameron then moved to Rat Portage (now Kenora), which was claimed by both Manitoba and Ontario at the time. He oversaw developments in the lumbering and mining trades, opened a saw mill, and was one of the founders of the Maple Leaf Flour Mills. In later years, he would become President of Rat Portage Lumber Company. Cameron entered politics in 1901, having been elected as a councillor in Rat Portage. He would later serve as the city's mayor. In 1902, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal for the riding of Fort William and Lake of the Woods, defeating Conservative Thomas Smellie, 1483 votes to 1121. Cameron sat as a backbench supporter of Premier George Ross for the next three years. The Liberals lost the election of 1905, and Cameron lost his own riding to Smellie, 1536 votes to 1228. Shortly thereafter, he moved to Winnipeg to better oversee his business ventures. Cameron stood as a Liberal candidate for Winnipeg in the 1908 federal election, but lost to Conservative Alexander Haggart by 8747 votes to 6729. Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier appointed Cameron Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba on August 1, 1911. The position was largely ceremonial by this time, and Cameron had little involvement in the day-to-day affairs of the province's government. In 1915, however, Cameron used his constitutional authority to call a Royal Commission of Enquiry into an ongoing scandal involving the construction costs of the province's new legislative buildings. The Commission upheld charges against Rodmond P. Roblin's government by the opposition Liberals, and Roblin was forced to resign. Cameron was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1914 New Year Honours. Cameron's term in office ended in 1916. He died in 1921.",

Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens.",

  "text" : "Albert Benjamin \"Happy\" Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky. He represented the state in the U.S. Senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second Commissioner of Baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson, Ben Chandler, later served as congressman for Kentucky's Sixth District. A multi-sport athlete during his college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems. Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, Marvel Mills Logan, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A fiscal conservative and disciple of Virginia's Harry F. Byrd, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's New Deal and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late Kenesaw Mountain Landis as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of Jackie Robinson's contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, effectively integrating Major League Baseball. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title \"the players' commissioner\". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951. Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the University of Kentucky which was later named the Chandler Medical Center in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate Wallace G. Wilkinson was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor.",

  "text" : "Otto Vincent Lange (30 November 1797 – 4 November 1870) was a Norwegian politician. Lange was born in Jevnaker, but moved to Arendal. He worked as a school teacher, and helped found the local library and museum in 1832. In 1833 he was elected to the Norwegian Parliament for the first time. He then changed his civil job to that of surveyor of customs and excise. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1836, 1839, 1842, 1845, 1848, 1851 and 1854, representing the constituency of Arendal og Grimstad. In October 1854 he was appointed Minister of Church and Education, succeeding Jørgen Herman Vogt. In September 1855 he left that succeeded Vogt again, this time as Minister of Finance and Customs. He held this position periodically until June 1863, interrupted by spells as member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm from 1 June 1856 to 31 July 1857, 1 September 1858 to 30 September 1859 and 1 September 1861 to 31 August 1862. Otto Vincent Lange was married to Anne Nicoline Aall (1800–1886), daughter of businessperson, politician and historian Jacob Aall. The Aall family was a notable one; Anne Nicoline Aall's grandfather was businessman Nicolai Benjamin Aall (died 1798) and her uncles were politicians Niels and Jørgen Aall. Also, Otto Vincent Lange had a brother Ulrik Frederik Lange who was an educator and five-term member of Parliament. Otto Vincent's sister Barbara Abigael married Even Hanssen, whose son Johan Jørgen Lange Hanssen married Otto Vincent's daughter Lovise Jacobine. Otto Vincent Lange was proclaimed Knight of the Order of St. Olav 1847, promoted to Commander in 1857, and in 1863 was awarded the Grand Cross in 1863. He was awarded two Swedish orders: the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star and Knight of the Order of Vasa. Lange also held the first class (equivalent to Grand Cross) of the Ottoman Mecidi Order. He died in 1870 in Kristiania and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund.",

Bunn also made unsuccessful attempts to be elected as Oregon Attorney General in 1976 and to serve in Congress representing Oregon’s first congressional district in 1996, when his brother was running for re-election in the neighboring Congressional district. Bunn faced scrutiny over back taxes while Superintendent of Public Instruction and also was accused of committing over one thousand ethics violations by the Oregon Government Ethics Commission, stemming primarily from the use of a state car and use of a state cell phone for personal use. Bunn challenged their findings and later reached a settlement in which he did not admit wrongdoing and paid $25,000 to the Commission in a payment that could not be called a fine.",

In 2009, Henderson became the Liberal Party candidate for the federal seat of Corangamite, but narrowly lost to the ALP incumbent Darren Cheeseman in the 2010 election. In 2012 Henderson was preselected again as the Liberal Party's candidate for Corangamite at the 2013 federal election. She won the seat with a 4.6-point swing to the Liberal Party.",

  "text" : "Matthew Hale Carpenter (born Decatur Merritt Hammond Carpenter; December 22, 1824 – February 24, 1881) was an American attorney from the state of Wisconsin. He served in the United States Senate from 1869–1875 and again from 1879–1881. Recognized as an authority on constitutional law, he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th century America. Carpenter presented cases before the U. S. Supreme Court involving such matters as states' rights and regulation of corporations. Originally a Democrat, he evolved into a Republican during the Civil War, and helped perpetuate the Wisconsin party's political machinery. His sustained support for President Ulysses S. Grant's administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden in the disputed presidential election of 1876 outraged many Republicans. A gifted orator, he was dubbed \"the Webster of the West.\"",

  "text" : "Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (February 6, 1731 – September 4, 1771) was an English nobleman and last in the line of Barons Baltimore. Although he exercised almost feudal power in the Province of Maryland, he never once set foot in the colony and, unlike his father, he took little interest in politics, treating his estates, including Maryland, largely as sources of revenue to support his extravagant and often scandalous lifestyle. In 1768 he was accused of abduction and rape by Sarah Woodcock, a noted beauty who kept a milliner's shop at Tower Hill. The jury acquitted Calvert but he left England soon afterwards, and never recovered from the public scandal which surrounded the trial. Dogged by criticism and poor health, he contracted a fever and died in Naples at the age of 40.",

  "text" : "Georges-Casimir Dessaulles (September 29, 1827–April 19, 1930), was a Canadian businessman, statesman and senator. Dessaulles holds the record for the oldest serving politician. Appointed to the Canadian Senate representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102. Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques. In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record. Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday. His daughter Henriette Dessaulles became a noted writer and journalist.",

Born in Lismore in Northern New South Wales to a prominent political family and educated at Lismore High School, Morton left school at fourteen to be employed in a legal firm, before branching out into various businesses. Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972. He died in Mosman aged 88 in 1999.",
