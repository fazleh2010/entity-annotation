National candidate Pansy Wong filed a complaint to the electoral commission about Wang's billboards which exhorted \"Vote for Wang, get Wang and Wong\" (because Pansy Wong's high rank on the National Party List assured her of a seat in parliament).

Februar 2007 als Vertreter der kongolesischen Kleinpartei Unafec (Nationale Union der Föderalisten des Kongo) für einen Tag den Posten des Außenhandelsministers der Demokratischen Republik Kongo. Wahrscheinlich ist diese Person rein fiktiv. Unklar ist, auf wessen Betreiben und warum das nichtexistente Parteimitglied der Unafec auf die Liste der Minister des Kongo geriet. Kasongo Ilunga war einer von 60 Ministern und Vizeministern, die am 5. Februar 2007 vom Kabinett des Präsidenten Joseph Kabila nominiert wurden. Vorgeschlagen worden war er dem Premierminister Antoine Gizenga im Januar 2007 von der Parteiführung der Unafec, die ihn mitsamt Foto als Vizepräsidenten des Unafec-Ortsvereins Masina in Kongos Hauptstadt Kinshasa vorstellte und gemeinsam mit dem Parteichef Kisimba Ngoy als Ministerkandidaten ihrer Partei zur Auswahl stellte. Gizenga entschied sich für Ilunga Kasongo. Bereits am Tag nach der Regierungsbildung reichte Kasongo allerdings angeblich schriftlich bei seinem Parteichef seinen Rücktritt ein. Der Unafec-Provinzchef von Katanga, der angeblichen Heimatprovinz Ilungas, erklärte kurz darauf öffentlich, dass es kein Parteimitglied dieses Namens in Katanga gebe. Zwei Theorien kursieren, wie es zur Ernennung des offenkundig nicht-existenten Ilunga gekommen sein könnte. Nach der ersten Theorie hatte die Partei nicht mit der Ernennung Ilungas gerechnet und nur beabsichtigt, das Vorhandensein personeller Alternativen in der Partei vorzutäuschen. Die zweite Theorie bezieht sich darauf, dass der Unafec-Parteichef als Nachfolger Kasongo Ilungas einen „Pierre Ilunga“ vorschlug. Pierre Ilunga jedoch ist ein politisch diskreditierter ehemaliger Justizminister der früheren Kriegsherr-Regierung des Kongo, der auf diese verwickelte Weise u. U. in die Regierung kommen sollte. Eine Klarstellung des Regierungssprechers Godefroid Mayombo, dass Kasongo Ilunga mitnichten eine fiktive Person sei, führte dazu, dass sich innerhalb weniger Tage drei Personen mit dem im Kongo recht häufigen Namen Kasongo Ilunga meldeten und den Posten des Ministers beanspruchten. Alle drei wurden jedoch vom Unafec-Parteichef als Betrüger bloßgestellt.",

At age 31 he became the state's youngest governor and served from 1825 to 1831, the longest period for an Indiana governor under the state constitution of 1816. During Ray's term as governor the state experienced a period of economic prosperity and a 45 percent population increase. He supported projects that encouraged the continued growth and development of the young state, most notably internal improvements, Native American removal, codification of Indiana's laws, improved county and local government, and expanded educational opportunities. Ray was known for his eccentricity and early promotion of a large-scale railroad system in the state. His support for new railroad construction and alleged involvement in several scandals caused him to lose popularity among voters. Ray's opponents who favored the creation of canals considered railroads to be an impractical, utopian idea. Following Ray's departure from political office, he continued to advocate for a statewide railroad system until his death in 1848.",

  "text" : "Jonathan Jennings (March 27, 1784 – July 26, 1834) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine-term congressman from Indiana. Born in either Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806. Jennings initially intended to practice law, but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself, and pursued interests in land speculation and politics. Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career. In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown, in Clark County. He was elected as the Indiana Territory's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate. By 1812 he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government. Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812. As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816, which authorized the organization of Indiana's state government and state constitution. He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention, held in Corydon in June 1816, where he helped draft the state's first constitution. Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government. In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements. Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life. His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years. Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings's life and impact on the development of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings's importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen's assessment that the state \"owes him more than she can compute.\"",

  "text" : "Jacquelin Holzman (born c. 1936) served as mayor of Ottawa, Canada, from 1991 to 1997. Never attending university, she married at age nineteen and started a family. She became a volunteer, especially on causes relating to the disabled. She was elected to Ottawa city council in 1982 representing the Richmond Ward (now Bay Ward), defeating future mayor Bob Chiarelli, and became one of the more right-leaning city councillors. Acclaimed in the 1985 election, she soon ran into controversy in her second term over an expansion to the Carlingwood Shopping Centre. Holzman supported the expansion but many of her constituents were opposed. In the 1988 Ottawa election, she faced a strong challenge from Alex Cullen but was re-elected with a solid majority. She was a close ally of mayor Jim Durrell and was described as his heir apparent. When he chose not to run for re-election, Holzman ran against left-leaning councillor Nancy Smith. Holzman ran on a pro-development and tax cut platform and defeated Smith and interim mayor Marc Laviolette. During her first term, she worked for the 'Yes' side in the Charlottetown Accord referendum. She worked hard to increase Ottawa's international status. In 1993 she represented Ottawa in Tokyo at the Third Capitals of the World Conference. In the same month, she led a trade mission to Taiwan to promote Taiwanese investment and tourism in Ottawa. During her term, she was a strong supporter of Taiwan establishing an office in Ottawa. In the 1994 mayoral election she faced a number of challengers. She was accused of arrogance for planning an expedition to China under the assumption she would win re-election. Her second term was also mostly uneventful. One major debate was over the mayor's desire to add an expensive unity tower to the new city hall. The tower was left unfinished, as it remains today. In November 1996 she announced that she would not run for re-election, citing the desire to spend more time with her family. She was expected to face a difficult election against city councillor Jim Watson. After leaving the mayor's office, she became head of the Ottawa Congress Centre. The next year she was diagnosed with breast cancer, but was treated successfully, and became an advocate for breast cancer related causes. In 2002 she became chair of the Ottawa Health Research Institute. She remained head of the Congress Centre before retiring in 2004. In 2007 she was appointed to the board of the National Capital Commission.",

His positions created a rift between him and the Indiana General Assembly who overrode all of his anti-banking vetoes. He responded by launching legal challenges to the acts, but was ruled against by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia.",

He worked as General Secretary of the Alliance Party from 1974 until 1982 and was a member of Belfast City Council between 1977 and 1985. In 1982 he was elected to the Prior Assembly for North Down and two years later he became the new leader of Alliance, succeeding Oliver Napier. During his tenure as leader he sought to strengthen the party's links with the British Liberal Party. The Anglo Irish Agreement was signed during this period and Cushnahan faced the difficult position of giving Alliance support to it and facing the united opposition of the Unionist parties. However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice. Two years later Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency. He was an MEP for fifteen years before retiring at the 2004 elections. Cushnahan now serves as a board member of the peace and reconciliation charity Co-operation Ireland.",

He then represented the Napier electorate from 1884 to 1890, when he retired. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 20 January 1891 and served until his death on 6 October 1917. He was appointed to the Council as one of seven new members (including Harry Atkinson himself) appointed to the Council by the outgoing fourth Atkinson Ministry; a move regarded by Liberals as a stacking of the upper house against the new government. Ormond was baptised on 28 June 1831. He came from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, (then Berkshire), England, and established a homestead called Wallingford in Central Hawke's Bay in 1847, which became a major farming station. Businessman and farmer Sir John Ormond, politician and farmer Tiaki Omana, and politician and Historic Places Trust chairman Ormond Wilson were his grandsons. His brother-in-law and husband of his sister was the Governor of Jamaica, Edward John Eyre. His second great-granddaughter is the Headmistress, Ormond Felicity Lusk. He married Hannah Richardson on 4 December 1860, the sister of George Edward Gordon Richardson. He died on 6 October 1917 at his home 'Tintagel' in Napier.",

  "text" : "Jack C. Voight (born December 17, 1945) is a Wisconsin insurance agent and a former State Treasurer of Wisconsin. He is a member of the Republican Party. Born and raised in New London, Wisconsin, Voight received his Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh in 1971. After serving as an Army sergeant from 1968–70, he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where he established an insurance agency. Voight served on the Appleton City Council from 1983–1993, holding the position of council president from 1992 - 1993. When incumbent Treasurer Cathy Zeuske ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1994, Voight ran as the Republican nominee to replace her. He was elected that year, and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. He was defeated for re-election on November 7, 2006, by Democrat Dawn Marie Sass, a former parole officer and AFSCME union activist, now working as a clerk at the department store Boston Store, in what was considered an upset. Voight had defeated Sass in both 1998 and 2002, and Sass said she spent less than $4000 on the race, most out of her own pocket. Voight held the position of president of the National Association of State Treasurers in 1997. In May 2009, Voight announced his interest in seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in 2010, but instead, the following June Voight announced he was going to run to replace retiring Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer. On April 5, 2011, he was defeated by former Assemblyman and unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor Tom Nelson, by roughly 52% - 48%. Voight blamed the political unrest stemming from Governor Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents.\"",

In an interview with CBC Radio van Dongen said the suspension was a result of his being cited twice in one year for driving in excess of 41 km/h above the posted speed limit. Van Dongen featured prominently in anti-speeding advertising campaigns for the provincial government in recent years. Three days later, van Dongen resigned as Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor-General.

There was a great depression during the mid-1860s and Bathgate had lost money to the Commercial Banking Co., and had allowed the Southland Provincial Council to overdraw well beyond the agreed limit. These events put an end to Bathgate's banking career. From June 1871 to November 1872, he served on the Executive Council of the Otago Province. He represented two Dunedin electorates in the House of Representatives, first the City of Dunedin electorate from 1871 to 1874, when he resigned to take up the offer by Premier Julius Vogel of resident magistrate in Dunedin and district judge for Otago, and the Roslyn electorate from 1881 to 1884, when he was defeated.

The two other candidates were Edward Withy (a political novice who, after early retirement from business, had emigrated with his large family to Auckland in 1884) and Henry Thomas Garrett. Tole and Garrett were liberal politicians, whilst Withy was a conservative. The liberal vote was split, and Tole, Withy and Garrett received 606, 701 and 170 votes, respectively, with Withy thus elected.

He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death.

He emigrated to Nelson in 1842 on the George Fyfe. He travelled with his wife, Martha, and her family; Henry Redwood and Francis Redwood were her brothers. He was a devout catholic. Since 1854, he had lived in Brookby, a locality some 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) south of Renwick. Ward was a surveyor by trade, and he surveyed parts of the Wairau Valley, and the town and district of Kaikoura. He became a significant runholder who at one point had 50,000 sheep. He joined provincial politics in 1853 when the provinces were set up. For the first five years, he represented the Wairau electorate in the Nelson Provincial Council. When the Marlborough Province split off from Nelson, Ward was elected onto the Marlborough Provincial Council and had continuous representation until the abolition of the provincial system in 1876. Ward's first attempt of getting elected to the general assembly was in the 1872 Wairau by-election, but he was beaten by Arthur Seymour. When Seymour resigned in 1875 prior to a trip to England, Ward won the resulting 1875 by-election and represented the electorate from 21 June to 6 December, when he was defeated for Cheviot. Ward had been ill for a few months prior to his death, and for the last few days was unconscious. He died on 12 November 1892 at his home. He was survived by his wife, six sons, and two daughters. Wards Pass, an alpine pass that lies between the valleys of the upper Acheron and Awatere Rivers, was discovered by Ward and his brother-in-law, Cyrus Goulter, in March 1847, and is named after him.",

  "text" : "Hoos was born in Neuwied am Rhine, Germany on August 31, 1850. He was an upholster and after immigrating to the United States, started a furniture business in Jersey City. His wife Dora Wilkins, of Hanover, Germany, died in 1890. In 1897, he was pushed by Democratic political boss, Robert Davis, to run for Mayor of Jersey City. The mayoral election of 1897 was very controversial. The Republican controlled state legislature passed the McArthur Act which postponed Jersey City and Newark's elections from the Spring to November to make them coincide with the state elections. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that this was unconstitutional. The Republicans appealed the Supreme Court's decision to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals. Since the decision was under appeal, the Republicans claimed that the elections planned for April 14 should not be held at that time until the court ruled on their appeal and if they were held then their results would not be valid until after the appeal was ruled on. The Democrats claimed they would be held and their results would be valid. Hoos won the election against Republican J. Herbert Potts, 15,264 votes to 12,018. however, Mayor Peter F. Wanser refused to vacate the mayor's office claiming the election was not valid until their appeal was heard in court. Hoos had to formally demand Wanser to leave the office on May 3, 1897. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled in September in favor of Hoos. Hoos won re-election over Republican Edward M. Watson by an even bigger margin of 7,000 votes on April 11, 1899. Hoos had served two terms (May 3, 1897 to December 31, 1901), but Boss Davis knew the voters wanted a change and dumped Hoos from the ticket in 1901 in favor of Edward L. Young (New Jersey), son of Edward Faitoute Condict Young (Davis' financial backing). It did not matter to the voters who swept in Republican Mark M. Fagan as mayor. Hoos died on October 24, 1912 and was buried in New York Bay Cemetery in Jersey City alongside his wife and three of his children.",

On 28 April 1868, Hamlin married Sarah Grace Barriball, the daughter of Charles Barriball of Waiuku, at his father's house near Waiuku (Barriball Road in Waiuku commemorates the location of the family's land). Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890.

His father's family were publishers to the University of Edinburgh. After receiving a good education, McGlashan worked in the book trade. Inspired by his brother's work as secretary for the Otago Association, he decided to emigrate and left in 1848. He went to Adelaide in South Australia, then Melbourne and finally Sydney, where he sold the books that he took with him for a good profit. There, he purchased provisions that he took with himself to Dunedin in 1850, which he could once again sell at a good profit. In 1853, he was joined in Dunedin by his older brother, John McGlashan. Edward McGlashan worked at first as a registrar at the Supreme Court under Justice Sidney Stephen. He then leased a flour mill from William Henry Valpy on the Water of Leith. He also had a store and auction room in Princes Street. From 1858 until 1862, when the Otago Gold Rush began, he was in partnership with W. Carr Young, and they traded as Young and McGlashan. McGlashan visited England in 1862. Edward McGlashan stood for election in the first Otago Provincial Council, and represented the Dunedin Country electorate from 28 September 1853 to 15 September 1855. He was unsuccessful at some later provincial elections. In 1865, he contested the superintendancy, but was beaten by Thomas Dick. He would later represent the North Harbour electorate in the 6th and 7th council, from 17 March 1871 until the abolition of the provincial governments on 31 October 1876. He represented the City of Dunedin electorate from the 1860 general election to 1862 when he resigned; and then the Roslyn electorate from the 1871 general election to 1875, when he resigned. McGlashan had various business interests later in life. He dealt in stock and farmland, and owned Mount Stokes station. He owned steamers and was milling in The Catlins. He started to manufacture paper, but was unsuccessful in making it from tussock grasses. He moved to Timaru for some years and was a director of a number of companies, including a major shareholder in the New Zealand Shipping Company. After a long visit to England from 1881, he returned to Dunedin to live in St Clair. McGlashan married twice, and his second wife was Henrietta, the daughter of George Bell; they married on 10 March 1880. McGlashan's health was poor for his last few years. He died on 31 July 1889 at his residence in St Clair, and was survived by his second wife.",

Barff was born in the English county of Kent on 5 March 1833, probably at Lee (now part of Greater London), where he was baptised five months later. He first came to New Zealand to join the West Coast Gold Rush in the mid-1860s. The West Coast was initially part of the Canterbury Province and following a requisition in October 1865, he was first elected as the member of the West Coast Goldfields electorate in the following month. Barff and Evan Prosser, who was elected at the same time, were the first members from the West Coast on the Canterbury Provincial Council. In July 1866, Barff became a member for the Westland electorate. He remained a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council until December 1867. The Westland district separated from the Canterbury Province on 1 January 1868, and Barff joined the Westland County, which was the predecessor to Westland Province. During the existence of Westland County (January 1868 – November 1873), Barff represented the ridings of Westland, Ōkārito, and Arahura. He did not join the Westland Provincial Council, but stood for the first election in January 1874 as one of three candidates in the two-member Arahura electorate (incorrectly referred to as 'Waimea' in some sources). Much to his surprise, he was defeated with 120 votes by Richard Seddon and Houlahan, who were equal at 145 votes. He represented the Westland South electorate in the House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870, when he was defeated for Hokitika by John White. He then represented the Hokitika electorate from 1876 to 1879, when he was again defeated. Barff died in Kumara in 1882; he had never married.",

He relocated to Auckland in 1841, where he became a member of the New Zealand Parliament. Biography Porter was born in London in 1784. He married Alice Roper in Liverpool (c. 1811), with whom he had four children. Porter became a prominent sea captain, operating a small fleet out of his own yard at Liverpool. He and other members of the Porter family sailed for the British East India Company (e.g. his cousin, George Porter). In the late 1830s he suffered substantial losses at sea, which his son said were behind his decision to migrate. Porter sold his shipyard in Liverpool and took two of his ships, Porter, and Dorset, provisioned with livestock and a range of personnel (including a doctor, tutors and servants), so that he could set up a relatively self-sufficient farming station at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula. Porter himself captained his namesake, the Porter (a 252-ton brig), which he had built in 1824 and which had been strengthened so that it would be fit for the hazardous voyage. Upon arrival, he used this vessel to set up a shipping service from Port Lincoln and Adelaide to and from other Australian and New Zealand ports. Porter also built the Dorset (95 tons) in 1838, specifically as a back-up ship for the journey to Australia. This was sold upon arrival. Porter’s expedition arrived at Port Lincoln in early 1839. The party was just one of three to arrive with settlers for the district in the 1830s and 1840s. It became apparent to him that Adelaide would be the main settlement in South Australia and that immediate prospects for Port Lincoln would be limited. Impatient for success, he decided to forego the significant investment and effort he had made in the fledgling settlement (e.g. building two houses, establishing a bank and helping build the first Church of England). He abandoned the settlement in 1840. Although Porter’s tenure in Port Lincoln only lasted 18 months, he had, nevertheless, been appointed the first Magistrate of the Eyre Peninsular and his family left its name at ‘Porter Bay’. In May 1841, Porter arrived in New Zealand. Alice was sceptical and had returned to Liverpool with their son, William Field junior. She waited until he was properly settled, before joining him in Auckland. Porter served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Suburbs of Auckland electorate from 1853 to 1855, when he retired, but did not serve in any further Parliaments. He also served on the Auckland Provincial Council. Porter died on 30 March 1869 at Mangatangi, Waikato.",

He was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council on 30 April 1878, and served until he died. In 1893 Reynolds was at the centre of a drama that led to the passing of the Women's suffrage bill into law. Premier Seddon had expected to stop the bill in the upper house, but found that one more vote was needed. Thomas Kelly, a new Liberal Party councillor had left himself paired in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon's manipulation so incensed two opposition councillors, Reynolds and Edward Cephas John Stevens that they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 and so gave the vote to women. Reynolds married Rachel Pinkerton in 1856 and together raised nine children.",

  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness.

For the latter three years of his term, he was selected to serve as speaker of the assembly, serving until his retirement in 1902 at the age of 73.

He lost his seat in 1875 but returned to the assembly in 1882. In 1894 he became leader of the opposition and finally the 12th Premier of British Columbia in August 1898.

The half brother Allan Kerr Taylor lived in Mount Albert in a house called Alberton; it is possibly to differentiate themselves from the main part of the family that the Mt Albert Talyors adopted Allan's middle name as part of their surname - becoming the Kerr Taylors or Kerr-Taylors. This may well have simply grown out of the social conventions of the period. Charles John Taylor served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament and the 2nd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Southern Division; (consisting of the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and East Cape regions). He resigned on 13 April 1858. From the 1861 election, he served in the 3rd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Raglan electorate. He resigned from Raglan before the end of that term on 1 April 1865. His election statement for the 1861 election read, \"Having always held opinions opposed to a centralising policy, I should vote for the repeal of the \"New Provinces Act.” I am prepared to unite with the other representatives of this province in obtaining a sweeping reduction in the expenditure now lavished on an overgrown and daily increasing official staff, and to act in concert with those gentlemen that Auckland may hold the prominent position due to her in the government of the colony.\" In that election he defeated Theodore Haultain. He represented the Southern Division electorate on the 3rd Auckland Provincial Council from 26 October 1860 to 12 September 1861. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 31 March 1869. His membership lapsed on 26 July 1878 through absence, when he and his family went to live in England.",

Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet.",

After serving as an independent member of the Chamber of Deputies for one mandate (1899-1903), he aligned his views with those of Take Ionescu, and became a supporter of Romania's entry into World War I alongside the Entente Powers.

In February 1910 Asquith was considering him as a possible Chief Whip but was dissuaded by the outgoing Chief Whip Jack Pease who felt he was out of sympathy with many leading Liberals over the Lords. In March 1910 Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office, a position he held until he was defeated in the December general election of the same year. He sought a return to parliament at the Salford North by-election, 1917 as a Coalition Liberal candidate but was defeated by an Independent Labour candidate. He did not contest the 1918 General Election. He was Honorary Secretary of the Free Trade Union. He became a supporter of the official Liberal party that opposed the Coalition Government. He sought to make a return to parliament standing as Liberal candidate for South Aberdeen, in 1922 without success. He tried again in 1923 without success. He had published two works on Liberal politicians; Mr Lloyd George, a Study (1930) and Herbert Gladstone, a Memoir (1932).

  "text" : "Sir Clutha Nantes Mackenzie, né le 11 février 1895 à Balclutha et mort le 30 mars 1966 à Auckland, est un homme politique néo-zélandais, dédié durant l'essentiel de sa vie au soutien aux personnes aveugles. Il est le septième et dernier enfant de Thomas et Ida Mackenzie, née Nantes. Son père, homme d'affaires et homme politique, membre du Parti libéral, est brièvement Premier ministre en 1912, puis Haut-commissaire de Nouvelle-Zélande au Royaume-Uni de 1912 à 1920. Clutha devient fermier après ses études secondaires, et s'engage avec enthousiasme pour partir au front lorsque éclate la Première Guerre mondiale. Il est blessé aux yeux et perd la vue lors de la bataille de Chunuk Bair aux Dardanelles en août 1915. Envoyé en Angleterre, il est pris en charge avec d'autres soldats aveugles par Sir Arthur Pearson, fondateur du Foyer de St Dunstan's pour soldats et marins aveuglés. Pearson y promeut l'autonomie des aveugles. Encouragé, Mackenzie crée et édite un magazine pour les soldats sur le front : Chronicles of the NZEF. De retour en Nouvelle-Zélande en 1919, il y épouse Doris Sawyer, travailleuse volontaire anglaise qu'il avait rencontrée à St Dunstan's. Le couple aura cinq enfants. À la suite de son père il entre en politique, au Parti de la réforme (conservateur). Candidat malheureux aux élections législatives de 1919, il remporte la circonscription d'Auckland-est lors d'une élection partielle en 1921. Il ne siège toutefois que brièvement à la Chambre des représentants, battu aux législatives de 1922 par le candidat travailliste John A. Lee, lui aussi mutilé de guerre et ancien contributeur au magazine Chronicles. En 1923 il est nommé directeur de l'Institut du jubilé pour les aveugles (Jubilee Institute for the Blind), à Auckland. Il parvient à collecter des fonds pour ouvrir des ateliers où sont employés des aveugles, ainsi qu'un foyer pour les loger. Sous sa direction, et en accord avec sa philosophie d'autonomisation des personnes handicapées, l'institut propose des formations professionnalisantes et du travail aux aveugles. Il lui est toutefois reproché sa gestion dictatoriale de l'institut, et les règles de conduite très strictes qu'il impose aux résidents. En 1935 il est fait chevalier pour services rendus aux personnes aveugles. Il quitte l'institut en 1938, et voyage à l'étranger pour lever des fonds pour St Dunstan's. De 1942 à 1948 il est établi en Inde, présidant un centre de formations pour aveugles de guerre, branche locale de St Dunstan's. En 1947 il « entrepr[end] des missions pour les gouvernements de Chine et de Malaisie pour les conseiller sur l'aide aux aveugles ». Au début des années 1950 il travaille à l'Unesco à Paris, sur le développement d'un système de braille international. De 1952 à 1964 il préside le Conseil mondial du braille, et entreprend des missions dans plusieurs pays d'Afrique orientale et d'Asie. C'est néanmoins à son domicile à Auckland qu'il décède en 1966.",

Wharton wrote: \"The funny thing is, of course, that socialists know that Barack Obama is not one of us. Not only is he not a socialist, he may in fact not even be a liberal. Socialists understand him more as a hedge-fund Democrat.\" The article led to increased media attention that resulted in multiple appearances on Fox Business News and a series of radio interviews including a segment on the CBC. Since then, Wharton's articles have consistently been published in on-line left-wing publications such as \"Counterpunch,\" the \"MRZine,\" \"Dissident Voice,\" \"In These Times,\" \"Counter Currents\" and \"The Indypendent.\"",

He was a son of John Caldwell (1779–1857) and Hannah Pickett Robinson (1794–1875). He was born in Morganton, Burke County, North Carolina where he had a home for most of his life. Caldwell attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating on June 4, 1840. He was a member of Dialectic Senate. He was examined by the Supreme Court and admitted to Superior Court Practice (much like passing a bar examination) in June 1841, becoming solicitor for Burke County. In 1842 he was elected a member of the North Carolina House of Commons in which he served two sessions. In 1850 he represented Burke County in the state senate. After the close of the Civil War he was a member of the Reconstruction Convention, and President of Western North Carolina Railroad. Caldwell was elected the first Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 1868, the same year the state constitution had created the office. He became governor in 1871 upon the impeachment and conviction of Governor William Woods Holden. Caldwell was elected governor in his own right in 1872, by about two thousand majority, becoming the second Republican elected governor of North Carolina. His areas of interest were the state debt and the state finances and the opening of the public schools which had been closed in 1863 due to lack of money. He appointed Alexander McIver as Superintendent of Public Instruction and got a bill passed allowing private aid for public schools in order to gain funds to reopen the schools. Caldwell married Minerva Ruffin Cain on December 12, 1840. Tod and Minerva had at least four children: Mary Ruffin Caldwell, wife of Dr. Waighstill Collett; John \"Jack\" Caldwell, killed at Gettysburg; Martha R. Caldwell, wife of Edward W. Ward; and Hannah J. Caldwell, wife of Walter Brem. Shortly after arriving on July 9, 1874 at Hillsborough, Orange County, North Carolina to attend the railroad's stockholders' meeting, Caldwell became very ill and died unexpectedly two days later on July 11, 1874. Newspaper reports stated he died from cholera morbus. His body was returned to the state capital to lie in state after which his body was carried to Morganton and buried in the family plot in Forest Hill Cemetery.",

Premier Seddon had expected to stop the bill in the upper house, but found that one more vote was needed. Kelly had left himself paired in favour of the measure, but Seddon obtained his consent by wire to change his vote. Seddon’s manipulation so incensed two opposition councillors William Hunter Reynolds and Edward Cephas John Stevens that they changed sides and voted for the bill, allowing it to pass by 20 votes to 18 and so gave the vote to women.

He came to Cranbrook around 1898 upon the completion of the Crowsnest Pass line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Caven was an employee of the Canadian Pacific Railway, a longtime railway conductor. A 1903 article stated that his property interests were largely a part of his money earned as a railway employee, noting that he \"[represented] the people that have made Cranbrook one of the flourishing and progressive towns of the province.\" In the British Columbia general election, 1903, he obtained the Conservative nomination for the provincial electoral district of Cranbrook, but he would ultimately lose out to Liberal James Horace King. After another defeat in 1907, Caven would eventually head to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, elected in 1909 and again, this time by acclamation in 1912. His term ended in 1916 when he was defeated again by James H. King. He attempted a return in 1920 as an Independent Conservative but he was defeated by King once again. He retired from the railway in 1923. In November 1906, Caven married Elizabeth Dickerson of Emporium, Pennsylvania. He was an active member of the freemasons, taking part in the Cranbrook Masonic Lodge, Royal Arch Masons and Seklirk Preceptory. Thomas Caven died suddenly February 20, 1926 at Vancouver. A newspaper report noted the \"profound shock\" that his death sent across the East Kootenay region, as it was not known that he was in ill health at the time.",

Born in East Lothian, Scotland, Bruce's family moved to County Cork, Ireland, when he was seven years of age. He became an apprentice sailor at 13, leaving London on an East Indiaman. He eventually arrived in New Zealand on the Blue Jacket in 1860. After working in the goldfields of New Zealand and Queensland, he went to the United States where he remained for several years. In 1877 he returned to New Zealand, buying land in Paraekaretu in the Manawatu region. Bruce was an independent conservative Member of Parliament in the Manawatu region of New Zealand. He represented the Rangitikei electorate from 1884 to 1890. He contested the 1890 election in the Waitotara electorate, but was beaten by the incumbent, George Hutchison. The Rangitiki electorate, meanwhile, was won by Douglas Hastings Macarthur in 1890, but Macarthur died on 24 May 1892. The resulting 1892 by-election was won by Bruce. He served until the end of the parliamentary term in 1893 when he retired. He was one of three candidates to contest the new Manawatu electorate in the 1896 election, but he was narrowly beaten by John Stevens. He challenged Stevens again in the 1899 election but was again defeated. Bruce was a notable pioneer of the Manawatu District, who preserved several native forest remnants, including Bruce Park Scenic Reserve. Late in his life, he wrote a book about his experiences at sea. He died at his homestead Carrick in the Wanganui suburb of St. Johns Hill on 23 April 1917.",

  "text" : "Dingley Askham Brittin (1823–1881) was an English solicitor. He spent three years in New Zealand as a runholder and during that time, he represented the Christchurch Country electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives for one term. Brittin was born in Huntingdonshire, England in 1823. He received an education as a solicitor, but during his time in New Zealand, he did not practice in that profession. Brittin came out to New Zealand on the Minerva in 1853, together with his wife, and his brother John Danns Brittin, his wife and son. The Minerva, one of the ships chartered by the Canterbury Association, had left London on 29 September and Plymouth on 12 October 1852, and arrived in Lyttelton on 2 February 1853. Other notable passengers on the ship were Henry Sewell, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Jane and John Deans, Thomas Rowley, John Cuff, and Elizabeth Torlesse. The Brittin brothers took up run 105 at the mouth of the Rakaia River. They sold their land in 1854, and took land in the Port Hills. In the 1855 election, Brittin was one of four candidates in the two-member Christchurch Country electorate. He came second and represented the electorate in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament in 1856, but resigned during the 1856 session before the end of his term; the Speaker read out his letter of resignation on 31 July, two weeks before the session finished. He had to return to England on 'urgent business' in 1856 and feared that he may not be back in time for the start of the 1857 parliamentary session. In fact, he did not return to New Zealand, and historian George Macdonald noted that he \"was not heard of again\" in Canterbury. The resulting by-election was won by John Ollivier, who beat Crosbie Ward. Brittin died in 1881 and is buried at All Saints, the Parish Church of St Ives. His wife Anna Maria Brittin, who died in 1902, is buried next to him.",

On city council, her priorities include housing, urban planning, community development, transportation, social services, women's issues and social justice causes. As a previous head of Heritage Ottawa she worked to preserve heritage structures. She was easily re-elected in 1985 and 1988. She considered a bid for the mayoralty in 1991, but ended up supporting fellow progressive Nancy Smith who came in a strong second (36%) to Jacquelin Holzman (40%). Holmes was easily re-elected to council in 1991. In 1994 Holmes moved to the council of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, facing little opposition in her bid. She was acclaimed in 1998 and retired from council in 2000 when the regional municipality was abolished and replaced with the new amalgamated City of Ottawa. In 2003 she returned to city council, winning another convincing victory in her previous ward. Holmes was similarly re-elected in 2006. Holmes supported a bylaw to require property owners to promptly remove graffiti. Holmes was re-elected in 2011.",

In the 1896 election, he defeated Ropata Te Ao, and he held the Western Maori electorate to 1911 when he was defeated by Māui Pōmare. Wilson notes him as a Reform Party supporter. Kaihau does, however, appear on a poster of the Liberal Party in 1910. The New Zealand Herald, in its 1905 election reporting, also lists him as a government supporter, i.e. a Liberal. Those newspapers that listed political affiliation for Maori candidates for the 1908 election, The Star (Christchurch) and The Tuapeka Times, also show him as a supporter of the Ward Ministry.",

In 1881 Ihaia Tainui who had held the electorate since 1879 resigned so that Taiaroa could resume the electorate. Taiaroa then held the electorate from 1881 to 1885 when he was again appointed to the Legislative Council, where he served for 20 years until his death.

On May 14, 1861, in Ashland, a meeting of citizens was held in Central Park to recruit members for the Ashland Home Guard, an organization formed for \"the defense and protection of our families and homes\" from guerrilla raiders. The Home Guard had at the time of the meeting a roster of 31 members. Forty new members took an oath of allegiance to the state and nation at that time. Brodess was among them. Starting around November 15, 1862, Brodess served as a first lieutenant in Company A of the Fourteenth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry. He tendered his own resignation and was honorably discharged on November 17, 1862. In 1876, Brodess was elected mayor of Ashland, and a city council replaced to former town board. Mayor Brodess was elected for another two-year term in 1878, and again in 1880, but died in office. John Means was appointed to serve the remainder of his term. In 1912, his wife, Mary, claimed that, after his discharge, he was not paid travel pay, and she attempted to bring the case against the United States. On February 12 of that year it was decided that the claim was neither a legal nor equitable one, and any payment rested in the bounty of Congress",

The son of a manufacturer, Wilson's family had extensive business interests in the area of Picton, Ontario. Wilson studied medicine and moved to Edmonton in 1882, one of the first physicians to settle there. He was appointed to official medical positions and, for several years, owned a drugstore in town. He served as a consultant to First Nations reserves near Edmonton and also became a director of many local corporations. He was elected to the Territorial council in 1885, and soon became its speaker. During his speakership, he helped to change the council's rules and procedures. He left territorial politics after six years, citing health reasons. He maintained a medical practice in town for many years, and went to considerable efforts to keep up with the latest practices. Wilson interested himself in civic activities in Edmonton, and eventually ran for mayor, winning election in 1895. He left office after less than two years in a dispute over town funds. He attempted a comeback in 1904, but was defeated in a run for the town council. He married in 1886, and had a son and two daughters. He died in 1909; an industrial park in the city is named for him.",

She is currently Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand, after serving as a member of the Niue Assembly (national Parliament) and a minister in Toke Talagi's government. She was previously a long-standing leading figure in the informal parliamentary Opposition to Young Vivian's government. She was, from 2008 to 2011, Minister of Health, Minister of Public Works, Minister of Women’s Affairs, and Minister in charge of the Niue Power Corporation. She had previously been Minister of Education, Health, Environment, Training and Development. Additionally, Jacobsen is a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and Patroness of the Niuean Volleyball Association. Following the 1999 general election, she was a candidate for the post of Premier (head of government), who is selected by the national Assembly. She lost to Sani Lakatani, of the Niue People's Party, by six votes to fourteen. Following the 2005 general election, Jacobsen was Young Vivian's only opponent contending for the position of Premier. She was defeated by three votes to seventeen. Vivian thanked her for competing against him: \"That the selection was contested, thanks to Ekepule [member of the Assembly] O’love Jacobsen, confirms our determination under the Westminster system of government to adhere and uphold one of the fundamental principles of democracy.\" In February 2008, Jacobsen stated that landowners had been bullied into authorising the building of a hotel and golf course on their land, a project supported by the government and funded by Chinese investors. Premier Young Vivian rejected the allegation. In the lead-up to the 2008 general election, which saw her successfully retain her seat in the Assembly (as a common roll representative, Jacobsen was critical of the fact that several members of the Assembly would be re-elected unopposed. She accused Vivian of discouraging people from taking part in the election as Opposition candidates, and argued that a democracy requires voters being able to choose between several candidates in each constituency. \"If the principle of democracy is going to be upheld, then it is very important that people do need to go to the polls and not have them unopposed and become duly elected.\" Vivian rejected Jacobsen's criticism, and argued in return that candidates were chosen within the villages, in traditional ways. With such a practice, he said, \"there is no conflict, there’s peace and togetherness.\" A government news publication stated with thinly veiled criticism that Jacobsen \"saw herself as a self-appointed backbench champion of the masses\". Following the election, Jacobsen supported Toke Talagi's candidacy to prime ministership, against Vivian, and was appointed to Talagi's small Cabinet. In March 2011, she resigned from government and from the Assembly to be appointed Niue's High Commissioner to New Zealand.",

Samuel was the elder brother of Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel. He attended the Liverpool Institute and University College School, Hampstead, London. He served as Justice of the Peace for the county of London. In 1889 he stood as a candidate for the newly formed London County Council for the Progressive Party, the municipal wing of the Liberal Party. He contested Whitechapel, and was elected with 1,523 votes, along with his running mate, Charles Tarling, who polled 1,477 votes. He served for one term, before standing down in 1892. Samuel was selected as Liberal candidate for Whitechapel in 1900, in succession to his uncle Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling, who had been the MP. He knew the constituency well, having represented it on the LCC. He held the seat for the Liberals with an increased majority. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 election with a landslide, he was again returned at Whitechapel. The Liberal Party faced the elections in 1910 against a resurgent Conservative Party. Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections. Over the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat. In 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery. In April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election. His Conservative opponent from 1910 ran against him in the by-election. He was re-elected with a reduced majority. Samuel retired from politics in 1916.",

He was first elected to North Bay City Council in 1973, and served as a city councillor until his elevation to the office of mayor, including serving as deputy mayor after 1978. He was appointed mayor in June 1984 following the death in office of Merle Dickerson, and was subsequently elected as mayor in the municipal elections of 1985, 1988 and 1991. His term in office was marked by initiatives that included the acquisition of the Dionne Quintuplets homestead as a community museum, the creation of a heritage train attraction in the city's Waterfront Park, the launch of \"Haleyfest\", a Christmas choral concert which still takes place annually in the city, and other economic development initiatives to revitalize the city's downtown and waterfront areas. During his term as mayor he also ran as an Ontario Liberal Party candidate in Nipissing in the 1990 provincial election, but lost to Mike Harris. He ran for another term as mayor of North Bay in the 2006 municipal election, but was defeated by incumbent mayor Vic Fedeli. Lawlor retired after teaching for nearly 45 years at Nipissing University. His son Sean Lawlor is also a former North Bay city councillor and deputy mayor. Since his retirement from Nipissing University, Lawlor has remained active as a consultant throughout Northern Ontario.",

  "text" : "Michael \"Mickey\" Cafagna (July 26, 1943 - April 11, 2009) was the third elected mayor of the city of Poway, California, serving from 1998 until his death in 2009. Cafagna was born in Detroit, Michigan, the third son of Italian immigrants. He moved to Poway (then an unincorporated part of San Diego County) circa 1975; following a successful career as a real estate developer, he was appointed to the Poway City Council in 1992, eventually winning the mayoral election in November 1998. As Mayor, Cafagna represented Poway in the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), serving for a time as its chairman. His other contributions include the construction of Poway's city hall and of the South Poway Business Park on Scripps Poway Parkway, his efforts to fund much-needed improvements to freeways and transit systems, and his leadership during the Cedar and Witch Creek fires of 2003 and 2007, respectively. He was most known for his outgoing personality and his ability to make deals for the benefit of the city. His genial manner also aided him in public situations; Deputy Mayor Don Higginson recounted an incident at the 1998 World Series between the New York Yankees and the San Diego Padres where Cafagna - just before his election as Mayor - invited Higginson and about a hundred others to travel to New York for the first two games. During Game 1, the Poway contingent sat among the Yankee fans, who booed them and threw beer on them. While others got up and left, Cafagna remained and offered to buy the Yankee fans a beer. By the end of the game, they were applauding him; when the party returned for Game 2, the Yankee fans cheered him. Even his political opponents, such as Poway's first mayor Bob Emery, acknowledged that while they had been opposed to his philosophies at first (Cafagna was a real estate developer, while Emery advocated slow-growth policy), they began to see things from his point of view, just as he saw things from theirs, and they grew to respect his character and his genial attitude. Cafagna had in fact avoided doing his development business in Poway to avoid conflicts of interest, and as Mayor opposed helter-skelter sprawl throughout the region (often with the \"How much do we have to grow before we destroy the reasons we live here\" speech, as Emery termed it). In 2005, Cafagna was diagnosed with kidney cancer and underwent an operation to remove it. However, it returned nearly four years later, having spread to his lungs. His illness prevented him from conducting day-to-day city government, and as a result Deputy Mayor Higginson became acting mayor. Cafagna was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on March 5 from what was previously thought to be pneumonia, but later determined to be septic shock; he died there on April 11, at the age of 65. After services at St. Michael's Catholic Church, he was buried a week later at Dearborn Memorial Park in Poway. Cafagna was survived by his wife of 43 years, Sharon Green Cafagna, as well as their two children, Kevin and Stacy, and five grandchildren.",

  "text" : "Mete Kingi Te Rangi Paetahi, né vers 1813 et mort à Putiki le 22 septembre 1883, est un homme politique néo-zélandais. Il est l'un des quatre premiers Maori à siéger à la Chambre des représentants. Membre de l’iwi (tribu) Te Ati Haunui-a-Paparangi dans la région de Wanganui, il s'implique dans les années 1850 dans les médiations pour ramener la paix dans cette région affectée par de violents conflits territoriaux inter-tribaux. Dans le même temps il participe à des réunions du mouvement Kingitanga, mais pour y exprimer son opposition au mouvement : le Kingitanga affirme son indépendance vis-à-vis des autorités coloniales, tandis que Mete Paetahi est partisan de la souveraineté britannique en Nouvelle-Zélande. Il s'oppose aussi au soulèvement de la secte Pai Marire dans les années 1860, et se joint aux forces maori pro-britanniques qui le combattent. Il prend part à la bataille de Moutoa le 14 mai 1864. Il fournit au gouvernement colonial d'importantes recommandations tactiques dans le conflit, et participe à la bataille d'Ohoutahi en février 1865, puis à l'expédition militaire des forces gouvernementales dans le Taranaki en janvier et février 1866. En 1868 se tiennent les premières élections pour des sièges réservés aux Maori à la Chambre des représentants. Seul candidat dans la circonscription couvrant l'ouest du pays, Paetahi est déclaré élu. Un mois après son entrée au Parlement en mai, les forces coloniales font à nouveau face à une résistance maori armée : l’iwi Ngati Ruanui, sous son chef Titokowaru, se soulève en réponse à des confiscations de terres. Mete Paetahi, s'exprimant au Parlement, incite le gouvernement à répondre avec fermeté, soulignant les exactions commises par les rebelles. La même année, il succède au statut de chef de plus haut rang des tribus du sud du Wanganui. Il perd son siège de député aux élections de 1871. Il ne participe dès lors plus à la vie politique coloniale, mais prend part dans les années 1870 à des réunions inter-tribales maori pour discuter de la représentation politique des Maori, et de l'attitude à adopter sur la question des terres. Il est généralement favorable à l'idée de vendre des terres aux colons, tant que les tribus en conservent suffisamment pour vivre. Il se consacre par ailleurs à l'élevage de moutons qu'il acquiert en 1877. Il meurt à l'âge d'environ 70 ans, et les autorités coloniales l'honorent de funérailles militaires, en reconnaissance de ses services durant les Guerres maories.",

  "text" : "James Franklin Hanly (April 4, 1863 – August 1, 1920) was a United States politician who served as a congressman from Indiana from 1895 until 1897, and was the 26th Governor of Indiana from 1905 to 1909. He was the founder of Hanly's Flying Squadron, which advocated prohibition nationally and played an important role in raising awareness about the effect of alcohol and arousing public support for prohibition. During his term as governor he successfully advocated the passage of a local-option liquor law, which led the majority of Indiana's counties to ban liquor sales. His other achievements included banning gambling, fighting political corruption, and adjusting state agencies to operate on a non-partisan basis. He left office and the Republican Party and became an active and vocal prohibitionist. He was an unsuccessful Prohibition Party candidate for President of the United States in the 1916 election.",

Green was born in Victoria, British Columbia in 1876 to Alexander Alfred Green and Theophila Turner Raines. He attended Corrig College at Victoria. After the death of his father in 1891, Green relocated to Montreal to attend McGill University where he would obtain his medical degree.Upon his graduation from McGill in 1898, Green worked as a physician on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway Crowsnest Pass line, in the Kootenay Valley, working on horseback. During the time he operated a hospital and treated many during an epidemic of typhoid. He later settled at Cranbrook, British Columbia, in the Kootenay Valley in 1899 to establish a medical practice. He was one of the first and only physicians, a medical pioneer at Cranbrook. A partnership with Dr. James Horace King of Cranbrook which started in 1903 was described as a \"cornerstone in local medicine\", with modern innovations being in use at the time, two examples being the first x-ray machine in the city being purchased for their hospital and the use of automobiles within the practice. In the British Columbia general election, 1941, Green was elected as a Conservative to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the district of Cranbrook. He was elected again in 1945 as a coalition member, serving until his retirement in 1949. He married Lillian Barbara Staples of Stillwater, Minnesota in June 1905. One of his sons, William Otis Green also became a doctor in the Cranbrook area, with whom he later shared a practice with. Frank W. Green died in 1953 of heart problems at St. Eugene Hospital in Cranbrook, which he had established. He was later cremated in Calgary. His wife Lillian died on October 22, 1965 at Cranbrook. The F. W. Green Medical Centre and F. W. Green Memorial Home continuing care centre at Cranbrook are both named after him.",

During his city council tenure, Schiff worked to ease ordinances prohibitive to small businesses, especially microbreweries, and strongly advocated against a publicly funded stadium for the Minnesota Vikings. In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for Mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 election but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June.

Graham was born in 1812; sources differ whether his birthplace was in Hove, East Sussex or at Frogmore in Berkshire, England. He belonged to Clan Graham, and his grandfather was an interpreter between the Scottish and the English. He became clerk of works with the Board of Ordnance aged 19, and belonged to the Royal Engineers for the next 25 years. He was posted to Ireland in 1835, to New South Wales in 1836, and to New Zealand in 1840. He worked for the Royal Engineers and was involved in public works, roading, and military installations. The Flagstaff War in the Bay of Islands in 1845–46 put a scare to the population of Auckland, and Graham supervised the enlargement of the Albert Barracks overlooking the town. He later claimed that the fortification of the barracks was not necessary, but by doing so, it would prevent the subdivision of the hill and that the area could thus later become a park. Indeed, Albert Park was formed in the 1880s. Graham was then sent to China, where he suffered a nervous breakdown after witnessing a fellow soldier being buried alive. He resigned from the military and returned to New Zealand, where he took up farming in Māngere. He represented the Newton electorate from 1861 to 1869, when he resigned. Graham retired to Hove in England for the last years of his life. He died at Hove on 14 February 1901. His son James Bannatyne Graham married Elizabeth Mary Josephine Sheehan, the sister of cabinet minister John Sheehan. Their son was George Samuel Graham.",

The 1881 election in the newly formed Tauranga electorate was hotly contested. Four candidates were nominated: Morris; William Kelly, who had also previously represented the East Coast electorate; George Vesey Stewart, then the owner of the Bay of Plenty Times; and Henry Thomas Rowe, a surveyor and commission agent. Rowe announced his retirement from the contest on 6 December three days out from election day, urging his supporters to vote for Stewart instead. The unofficial results were released the day after the election (Saturday, 10 December) and Morris had a majority of 13 votes over Stewart, with the official declaration to be made on 12 December. This was deferred until 14 December, with Morris ahead by 10 votes. Stewart stood for the Tauranga mayoralty a few months later and was elected the town's first mayor. He represented the Tauranga electorate until 1885, when he resigned. He was later a member of the Legislative Council, from 15 May 1885 to 16 April 1903, when he died.",

He is the only person to hold to every elected seat in the state government under the 1816 constitution. His brief term as governor was marked by the calling of a state constitutional convention and overshadowed by the national anti-slavery debate, where Dunning urged state leaders to issue and forward resolutions to Congress expressing opposition to the expansion of slavery. As a delegate to the subsequent convention, he successfully advocated legislative and educational reform. As the American Civil War broke out, he left the Democratic party and declared for the Union, personally raising many companies of soldiers for the war effort. He returned to the state senate during the war, and then resumed his law practice after his term ended.

  "text" : "(For other people named Arthur Eve, see Arthur Eve (disambiguation).) Arthur O. Eve (born March 23, 1933) is a retired American politician who served as a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly (1967–2002) and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly (1979–2002) representing districts in Buffalo, New York. He was the first Dominican-American elected to public office in the United States, and the first African American to win the Buffalo Mayoral Democratic Primary but was defeated in the following mayoral election. Eve was elected a New York State Assemblyman in 1966 and by the time of his retirement in 2002 had served in the New York State Assembly (143rd District 1967–82, 141st District 1983–2002) longer than any other incumbent member. As Deputy Speaker, he was the highest ranking African American in the New York State Legislature. During his political career he became a political foe of Western New York politician James D. Griffin and of New York State Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. He was a founding member of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. At the national level, Eve was once one of three alternates to the 15-person 1984 Democratic Party Platform Committee. Eve was an observer and negotiator during the 1971 Attica Prison riot and the first official to enter the facility to hear the demands of the inmates. An advocate for liberal causes such as economic development, education, job training and development, social services, crime prevention and parole reform, day care and housing, Eve was also a leader in the movement to legislate Harriet Tubman Day as a New York State holiday. He is the father of attorney and former candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York Leecia Eve.",

  "text" : "Adam Hofman (* 23. Mai 1980 in Kalisz) ist ein polnischer Politiker und seit 2005 Abgeordneter des Sejm in der V. und VI. Wahlperiode und war Vorsitzender des Forum der Jungen PiS. Er bestand das Abitur am IV. Allgemeinbildenden Lyceum \"Ignacy Paderewski\" in Kalisz und studierte Politologie an der Universität Breslau (Wrocław). Während des Studiums war er Mitglied des Niezależne Zrzeszenie Studentów (Unabhängiger Studentenverband - NZS) und gründete und leitete das Forum der Studenten der Universität Wrocław. Er war Berater des Stellvertretenden Stadtpräsidenten von Wrocław und arbeitete für die Spezialkommission des Sejm zum Lobbing-Gesetz. 2004 kandidierte er ohne Erfolg für die Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (Recht und Gerechtigkeit – PiS) für ein Mandat im Europäischen Parlament. Bei den Parlamentswahlen 2005 wurde er über die Liste der PiS für den Wahlkreis Konin in den Sejm gewählt. Am 15. Mai 2007 wurde er zum Vorsitzenden der Untersuchungskommission zu Banken und Bankenaufsicht gewählt. Bei den Sejmwahlen 2007 wurde er mit 15.824 Stimmen für die PiS als Abgeordneter bestätigt. Er ist Mitglied der Sejm Kommissionen für den Staatsetat sowie Sport. Er trat oft im Fernsehen und Rundfunk als Pressesprecher der Partei auf. Er gehörte zum engsten Kreis der Mitarbeiter des Parteivorsitzenden Kaczyński.Seine Erfolge führten ihn zum Verlust von Selbstkontrolle. Während der Senats-Ergänzungswahlen in Mielec brüstete er sich vor jungen Damen mit der Größe seines Geschlechtsteils, was bald im Fernsehen erschien. Während der Fahrt nach Madrid zur Sitzung des Europarates flog er aus Warschau mit einer kostengünstigen Fluglinie, verrechnete aber mit der Parlamentskasse seine Reisekosten als Reise mit dem eigenen PKW, was ihm einen bedeutenden Gewinn brachte. Dazu noch hat sich seine Ehefrau während des Fluges mit mitgebrachtem Wodka betrunken, was einen Eklat verursachte. In Madrid unterzeichnete er die Liste der Anwesenden, nahm aber an der Tagung nicht teil. Dafür wurde er von der PiS-Partei ausgeschlossen und verlor seine Chancen bei der 2015er Parlamentswahl.",

White and Moorhouse received 51 and 32 votes, respectively; a majority of 19 for White, who was thus elected. White resigned in 1863, and Lancelot Walker won the subsequent by-election. White's house Blythcliffe in 37 Rue Balguerie, Akaroa, is presumed to have been designed by Samuel Farr based on drawings prepared by the Australian architect John Verge. Built in 1857, it was \"the grandest house of its day in Akaroa\". Originally registered as Category II in 1983, its classification was later changed to Category I.",

Boulton stood again at the 1924 general election, when a Labour candidate also contested the seat. The Conservative vote increased, and Boulton's second-placed vote was less than half the Tory total.

Während der Krise in der Ukraine 2014 leitete er von April bis August, als der Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates, die Operationen im Osten der Ukraine, die als „Anti-Terror-Operation“ bezeichnet wurden. Während dieser Zeit sprach sich Parubij für die Einführung einer Visumpflicht für russische Staatsbürger aus. Jazenjuk nahm gegenüber der Frage der Visa-Regelung in Brüssel eine vorsichtigere Haltung an, angesichts der Tatsache, dass eine große Zahl der Bürger, in erster Linie im Süden und Osten des Landes, interessiert seien an der Beibehaltung des visumfreien Verkehrs nach Russland, da sie dort arbeiten oder Familie hätten. Bei der Parlamentswahl 2014 kandidiert er auf Platz vier der Volksfront. Nach der Wahl wurde er stellvertretender Parlamentsvorsitzender der Werchowna Rada. Am 14. April 2016 wurde Andrij Parubij in Nachfolge des neuen Ministerpräsidenten Wolodymyr Hrojsman mit 284 Abgeordnetenstimmen zum neuen Parlamentspräsidenten der Werchowna Rada gewählt.",

  "text" : "Alex M. Torpey (born August 10, 1987 in New York City) is a non-party affiliated American politician and consultant. Torpey was elected as the 48th Village President (equivalent of mayor) of South Orange, New Jersey in May 2011 for a four-year term by a 14-vote margin. At the age of 23 years at the time of being sworn in (May 16, 2011), he was the youngest Village President in South Orange’s history, and at that time the youngest serving mayor in the state of New Jersey. Torpey was one of the youngest mayors in the United States to oversee a municipality the size of South Orange, which has 16,000 full-time residents plus approximately 7,000 Seton Hall University students at their South Orange campus. On June 20, 2014, nearly 1 year before his first term was over, he announced he would not seek re-election to a second term. Torpey's term ended May 18 when he swore-in South Orange's second-youngest, and first female, Village President, Sheena Collum, whom he supported in the election, and had served with for two previous years on South Orange's governing body. Torpey was born in New York City, and raised first in Maplewood, then South Orange, and is an alumnus of Columbia High School (2005). Torpey completed his undergraduate degree in Political Science, American Government and Law at Hampshire College, while also serving as student government president. He also holds a Master of Public Administration in emergency management from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. Torpey founded is a managing partner of Veracity Media LLC, a social-impact consulting firm. Torpey also founded a nonpartisan initiative, Rethink Leadership, to help encourage young people to consider elected office and local government as a way to become more involved and active in their government and public policy issues. Torpey was named a 2013-2014 James Madison Fellow at the bi-partisan Millennial Action Project for his work in encouraging young people towards civics participation. Torpey also serves on the advisory board of the New Jersey chapter of the New Leaders Council and on Sustainable Jersey's Community Information and Citizen Engagement Initiative. Starting in the fall semester of 2014, Torpey was appointed adjunct faculty of governance and technology at Seton Hall University, co-teaching with Dr. Matt Hale, master of public administration students on topics of collaboration and technology innovation in government. Torpey’s philosophy of governance relies heavily on the use of technology, media and communications to increase interactivity, transparency and efficiency towards the ends of better government. He has written and lectured on these topics frequently prior to his election and since. While in office, Torpey primarily worked on a number of fiscal, economic development, public safety, transparency, community engagement and organizational development initiatives, in addition to petitioning utility companies for better preparedness efforts after Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy; along with several other New Jersey mayors, performing one of the first legal same-sex marriages in the state in 2013 (as well as being a vocal advocate on the issue); advocating for better open data standards, a tuition-credit program for volunteer first responders and updates to homelessness and veterans support programs. In addition to his official municipal responsibilities as Village President, Torpey served as a member and EMT of the South Orange Rescue Squad. Torpey also served as South Orange's municipal Office of Emergency Management Coordinator.",
