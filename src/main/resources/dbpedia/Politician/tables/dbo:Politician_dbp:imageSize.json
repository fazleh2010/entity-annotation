Er war der Kandidat für einen Senatssitz von Connecticut bei den Senatswahlen vom 7. November 2006. In den parteiinternen Vorwahlen, die die Kandidatur festlegen, besiegte er den Amtsinhaber Joe Lieberman. Lamont ist Erbe eines Millionenvermögens und Angehöriger exklusiver Country Clubs, was zu Heucheleivorwürfen im Wahlkampf führte. Jedoch verfehlte er den Einzug in den Senat. Er unterlag Lieberman, der als unabhängiger Kandidat 50 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen errang und damit den Wiedereinzug in den Senat schaffte. Lamont kam nur auf 40 Prozent der Stimmen. Viele Anhänger der Republikanischen Partei gaben Lieberman ihre Stimme und versagten dem republikanischen Kandidaten Alan Schlesinger die Gefolgschaft. Lieberman wurden allgemein größere Chancen als Schlesinger eingeräumt, Lamont zu schlagen. Außerdem gilt Lieberman als wertkonservativ und war so für viele Anhänger der Republikaner wählbar. Im November 2009 kündigte Lamont an, dass er eventuell für die Gouverneurswahlen 2010 in Connecticut kandidieren wolle; im Februar 2010 reichte er seine Kandidatur offiziell bei der Demokratischen Partei ein. Auf einem Parteitag im Mai 2010 unterlag er seinem internen Herausforderer Dan Malloy deutlich. Da Lamont aber die interne Hürde von 15 Prozent der Parteitagsstimmen klar schaffte, konnte er an den Vorwahlen der Demokraten vom 10. August 2010 dennoch teilnehmen, wo er aber ebenfalls klar gegen seinen Konkurrenten Malloy verlor.",

Hosaka war bereits in seiner Schulzeit in nationalen linken Schülerverbänden aktiv, die Shinjuku-Oberschule der Präfektur Tokio (Tōkyō-to-ritsu Shinjuku kōtō-gakkō) verließ er ohne Abschluss. In den 1980er Jahren war er als Bildungsjournalist tätig und setzte sich für antiautoritäre Bildungsformen ein. Bei der Shūgiin-Wahl 1996 kandidierte Hosaka gleichzeitig im Einzelwahlkreis Tokio 22, den er abgeschlagen auf Platz fünf verlor, und über die neu geschaffene Verhältniswahl für die SDP im Block Tokio. Da er alleine auf Listenplatz eins gesetzt war erhielt er den einzigen Sitz, den die Sozialdemokraten im Block Tokio gewannen. Dort wurde er 2000, als er den Wahlkreis Tokio 6 verlor, sowie noch einmal 2005 wiedergewählt, als die SDP eigentlich kein Mandat im Block Tokio erhalten hätte, aber einen Sitz gewann, weil die Liberaldemokratische Partei zu wenige Kandidaten nominiert hatte. Bei der Shūgiin-Wahl 2009 wechselte er erneut den Wahlkreis und trat im 8. Wahlkreis gegen Nobuteru Ishihara, den Sohn des Gouverneurs von Tokio, an, unterlag um rund 30.000 Stimmen. Da die SDP ohne Verhältniswahlmandat blieb, schied er aus dem Parlament aus. In seiner Zeit als Abgeordneter war er unter anderem Mitglied des Justizausschusses und Generalsekretär der Parlamentariergruppe für die Abschaffung der Todesstrafe von Shizuka Kamei. Bei der Sangiin-Wahl 2010 versuchte Hosaka über die landesweite Verhältniswahl den Wechsel ins nationale Oberhaus, erhielt knapp 70.000 Präferenzstimmen und erreichte damit den Listenplatz 3 – die SDP gewann aber nur zwei Verhältniswahlmandate. Bei den einheitlichen Regionalwahlen im April 2011 wurde er aus einem Feld von fünf Kandidaten zum Bürgermeister von Setagaya, der bevölkerungsreichsten Gemeinde der Präfektur Tokio, gewählt.",

Zhong Hui rose to prominence in the 250s when he became a close aide to Sima Zhao, the regent and de facto ruler of Wei. He advised Sima Zhao on how to deal with the Third Rebellion in Shouchun from 257–258 and was highly regarded by the latter. With Sima Zhao's help, Zhong Hui steadily moved up the ranks and became one of the key figures in the Wei government. In 263, the Wei imperial court ordered Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead separate armies to attack and conquer Wei's rival state, Shu Han. During and after the campaign against Shu, Zhong Hui framed Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu for treason and cowardice respectively, thereby eliminating them and putting himself in full control of all the Wei forces in Shu by the time Shu surrendered to Wei. In 264, with backing from Jiang Wei, a former Shu general, Zhong Hui started a rebellion against Sima Zhao. However, the revolt failed when Zhong Hui's plan to purge several Wei officers – because he was worried that they would not support him – was leaked out. The officers escaped from custody, regrouped with their men, mutinied against Zhong Hui, and killed him and Jiang Wei.",

  "text" : "Eldad Cicero Camp, Jr. (August 1, 1839 – November 21, 1920) was an American coal tycoon, attorney and philanthropist, active primarily in Knoxville, Tennessee, and the vicinity, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was president of the Coal Creek Coal Company, president of the Virginia-Tennessee Coal Company, a director of Knoxville's Third National Bank, and at his height, was one of the wealthiest men in East Tennessee. His prominent North Knoxville mansion, Greystone, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A Union officer during the Civil War, Camp arrived in Knoxville in 1865. In 1868, he killed Confederate colonel Henry Ashby in a notorious shootout in downtown Knoxville. Camp first rose to prominence as U.S. District Attorney for East Tennessee, serving from 1869 until 1871. During the late 1860s, he organized the Coal Creek Coal Company, which in subsequent decades grew to become one of the major coal producing companies in the region. In the 1890s, Camp helped establish Knoxville's Florence Crittenton Home and Camp's Home for Friendless Women.",

Tun Thirunyanasambanthan s/o Veerasamy, also known as T. Sampatang , was the fifth President of Malaysian Indian Congress and one of the Founding Fathers of Malaysia along with Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tan Cheng Lock. He was the MIC President from 1955 to 1973, when he was ousted by party members. Sambanthan was one of the leading Indian leaders who played a prominent role in the independence movement in Malaya. As president of the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) during this important period of transition, he worked closely with Alliance Party leader Tunku Abdul Rahman and they developed a close personal bond. He is credited with three important developments in Malaysian political history: the consolidation of the Malayan (now Malaysian) Indian Congress, its transformation into a mass-based party, and its integral role as a partner in the current ruling alliance. The entry of the MIC into the multi-communal Alliance in 1955 contributed greatly to enhancing the coalition's image as the main representative of the three main communities in Malaya. The finest hour was achieved on 31 August 1957 when Independence was achieved under the Merdeka Agreement, to which Sambanthan was a signatory.",

He resigned as leader after his second election defeat, and was replaced by his former deputy, Jeff Seeney. However, after only 16 months as leader and facing poor opinion polling against Seeney, Springborg replaced him. Following this defeat Springborg played a leading role in the creation of the Liberal National Party (LNP), becoming the party's first leader but resigning after he led it to defeat at the 2009 Queensland election. John-Paul Langbroek was elected as his successor, with Springborg elected as Deputy Leader. Following a move by the LNP organisation to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney respectively. The Newman-led LNP overwhelmingly won the 2012 election and Springborg became Minister for Health in the Newman Cabinet. After the 2015 election, Newman lost his electorate of Ashgrove and Springborg was once again elected leader of the LNP, with Langbroek serving as his deputy as the LNP returned to opposition after one term in office. On 6 May 2016, Springborg lost the leadership of the LNP to Tim Nicholls.",

A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina.",

  "text" : "Robert \"Bob\" Hastie (27 July 1861 – 9 April 1914) was an Australian politician who was the first parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in Western Australia. He was a member of the state's Legislative Assembly from 1901 to 1905. Hastie was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and spent time in New Zealand and Victoria before arriving in Western Australia in 1895 during the gold rush. Prominent in the labour movement on the Eastern Goldfields, he entered parliament at the 1901 state election, and was elected party leader shortly after. Hastie was replaced as leader by Henry Daglish in July 1904, who became premier the following month. He served as a minister in Daglish's government, but was defeated for preselection at the early 1905 election. Hastie eventually left the Labour Party, and unsuccessfully stood for the Commonwealth Liberal Party at the 1910 federal election.",

  "text" : "Dato' Seri Mohamed Nazri bin Abdul Aziz (born 15 May 1954) is a Malaysian politician from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), and is as of 2008 a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of affairs. In June 2005 Nazri caused controversy when he shouted the phrase \"racist\" (or variants of it) 28 times in Parliament. A request by opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) lawmaker Fong Po Kuan for Nazri to take back his comments went unheeded. The incident occurred during a debate on the Malaysian Medical Council's derecognition of Crimea State Medical University (CSMU) medical degrees; most Malaysian students sent to study there were of Indian extraction. Nazri has since used the phrase \"bloody racist\" on Tun Dr. Mahathir because the latter supports a controversial government programme that allegedly indoctrinates racist sentiments in civil servants and public university students. Nazri was originally also the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of legal affairs and judicial reform. After the 2008 general election, which saw the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition's majority in Parliament significantly reduced, the then Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi reshuffled his Cabinet and gave Nazri's legal affairs portfolio to Zaid Ibrahim. He has also recently (2006) been called the hatchetman of Abdullah, then Prime Minister of Malaysia, by Former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, for defending Abdullah in Mahathir's ongoing criticisms against the government. In September 2010 he came out openly in the defence of Prime Minister Najib's 1Malaysia policy, saying that he is a Malaysian first and a Malay next. This is in complete opposition to that expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister, Muhyiddin bin Mohd. Yassin, who has time and again reiterated that he is Malay first and Malaysian second. He is an alumnus of Malay College Kuala Kangsar.",

He was born in California to screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Mildred \"Mel\" (née Hicks) Hayes. Garrett was raised in Maine and moved back to California in 1969, where he later attended Beverly Hills High School and California State College at Bakersfield. He moved to Georgia in 1991 and currently serves as the secretary of the Cobb County Libertarian Party. After serving in a number of roles with the both county and state Libertarian organizations in Georgia, Hayes sought and won the party nomination for governor in 2002 and again in 2006. Hayes received 2.3% of the vote in 2003 and 3.8% of the vote in 2006. In his second run at office, Hayes set several benchmarks for third party politics in the state, beginning with being the first Libertarian to run twice for governor. Hayes’s campaign was the first Libertarian gubernatorial campaign to produce and run television advertisements in Georgia. He also garnered the highest polling numbers to date for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in the state, polling as high as 9% in one non-partisan poll, leading to press speculation that Hayes might force an unprecedented runoff electionbetween incumbent Republican Sonny Perdue and Democratic rival Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor. Though a runoff did not in fact result, Hayes still gathered both the highest number and the highest percentage of votes for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in Georgia. Hayes currently co-hosts a weekly Libertarian-themed political radio talk show on radio station WHIE in Griffin, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta.",
