  "text" : "Nicolas Hyeronimus (1 January 1808 – 27 June 1860) was a pioneering innkeeper, merchant, pastoralist and politician in colonial New South Wales, Australia. Born in Wallonia, Hyeronimus arrived in New South Wales in about 1840. In 1842, he established the Lion of Waterloo, the first inn at Montefiores, near present-day Wellington, in the central west of New South Wales. He later built the first house in Wellington, and established the Carriers Arms, the first inn at the present site of Dubbo, New South Wales. In about 1854, Hyeronimus built the homestead The Meeting of the Waters (now named Glenrock), on land west of the Bell River near Wellington. By 1859, he was the proprietor of Goonoo (now Goonoo Goonoo), a pastoral run of 30,000 acres (120 km2) in Wellington County, and also three other pastoral runs totalling 61,480 acres (248.8 km2) in Bligh County. On 15 June 1859, Hyeronimus was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the inaugural member for the electoral district of Wellington. However, he died in Sydney in 1860, after serving only just over one year in office.",

He was known as Johnny De Pow by his constituents. Along with Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Kenna, Powers was considered one of the leaders of the \"Gray Wolves\" of Chicago politics. Powers arrived in Chicago in 1872 and began working as an apprentice to a grocer. After opening his own grocery store, he added a tavern next to it and used his exposure there to begin a political career as a ward captain. In 1888, Powers ran for alderman of Chicago's 19th ward and won, after which he closed his grocery, but continued to run his saloon, eventually going into business with fellow an alderman, William O'Brian, to open a larger saloon which included gambling. Powers introduced the practice of distributing free turkeys, ducks, and geese to voters at Christmas, but his inability to keep his ward clean of garbage or maintain the schools led Jane Addams to target him. Addams also focused on Powers' corruption, citing instances of cronyism and bribery. Powers, in turn, used Addams's attacks on him to brand her as anti-Catholic, but he also hired her to be the ward's garbage inspector, the only paying job she ever held. In 1903, Powers ran against incumbent Peter F. Galligan for the state senate. During the campaign, Galligan showed up at Powers's home and attacked him with a brickbat. Powers won the election, but the following year he returned to Chicago and was reelected to serve as the 19th ward alderman, a position he retained until 1927. By the 1910s, the ethnic makeup of his ward had begun to change. Instead of being 90 percent Irish, it was only about 50 percent Irish, with the remainder being made up of Italian and Jewish immigrants. On September 28, 1920, a bomb exploded at Powers' home at 1284 Macalister shortly after he arrived, this proved to be the opening salvo in the 1921 aldermanic election. In 1921, Anthony D'Andrea, who Powers had supported for ward committeeman in 1919, but pulled his support after the Supreme Court negated D'Andrea's initial victory, challenged Powers for his seat as alderman. The election was marked by violence, which continued after Powers won the election by 381 votes. Shortly after the election, D'Andrea was assassinated. This election was the culmination of the Aldermen's Wars. Powers died as his home at 6038 Sheridan Road, on May 19, 1930, suffering from pulmonary edema and anemia, although he had been suffering throat tumors since 1929.",

He began to practice medicine in Lebanon, where he resided until 1884. He moved to St. Louis, where he continued his practice for four more years, where he was on the Missouri Pacific Hospital, the railroad hospital. He also served as surgeon for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. In 1888, Dr. Rodley left Missouri for California and located in Chico. In Chico, he practiced medicine, and served on the Chico Board of Trustees, and as its President. He owed four farms, where he raised grains, fruits and nuts.

In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. In 1908, he was a presidential elector for the Republican Party. Documentation exists from as early as 1898 in the form of letters and invoices, books and newspaper articles reflecting his business was already located at 1002 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL. In 1919, Stewart's Front Street store burned down, along with most of the downtown businesses in \"The Great Fire.\" After this time, the downtown was no longer in that area, but moved to the west side of U.S. 1. Stewart moved his business to New Haven Avenue. He may have moved his business to 1002 E New Haven Ave before the fire of 1919. In 1920, he was a co-founder of the Melbourne Golf and Country Club. He died in Melbourne, Florida, on June 18, 1936. He was buried in Daytona Beach, Florida.",

  "text" : "William John (Bill) Grummett (January 8, 1891 – 1967) was a Canadian politician. He represented the electoral district of Cochrane South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1943 to 1955 as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Grummett was the only CCF MPP to survive both the 1945 and the 1951 provincial elections, which saw most CCFers defeated, including party leader Ted Jolliffe. He was the CCF's House Leader and led the two person caucus in the legislature from 1951, following Jolliffe's defeat, until new leader Donald C. Macdonald entered the legislature in the 1955. Grummett was defeated in the 1955 general election by Ontario Progressive Conservative Party candidate Wilf Spooner, who was mayor of Timmins, Ontario, when the Liberals failed to field a candidate allowing \"old party votes\" to coalesce around Spooner. The son of a farmer in Maxwell, Ontario, just south of Collingwood, Grummett was the first lawyer in Iroquois Falls-Ansonville, having attended law school in Toronto, Ontario. He and his wife Marie raised their five children in Iroquois Falls, Ontario. He had fought in World War I as an officer in the British Army where he saw action in the Mesopotamian campaign. While there he contracted malaria which affected him for the rest of his life. He died in 1967.",

In response to public outcry after a coal ash spill into the Dan River in northern North Carolina from a facility owned by Duke Energy Inc., Apodaca said he planned to draft legislation in May 2014 to require Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash ponds, including the one in Buncombe County. He told the Hendersonville Times-News on February 12: \"I don't want a containment plan, I want a plan to get rid of it. ... We need a five- to 10-year plan to get rid of them because we don't need it sitting there next to the river.\" Over the court of his time in politics, Apodaca has accepted over $65,000 from organizations representing Duke Energy and Progress Energy. 61 In the 2013 legislative session, Apodaca introduced and voted for a bill, Senate Bill 10, to reorganize the Environmental Management Commission and the N.C. Utilities Commission and replace the members with new appointees. This Bill included the elimination of dozens of obsolete and rarely convened boards and commissions. Senate Bill 10 was not signed into law in 2013. Sen. Tom Apodaca said his main complaint to the House version was that it strikes language that would fire 12 special superior court judges. 60 In May 2013, after receiving the maximum $8000 contribution from North Carolina Automobile Dealers Association, Apodaca sponsored legislation that would make it illegal for any car maker to bypass dealerships and sell directly to consumers in North Carolina. Apodaca's proposal was widely criticized as anti-competitive and aimed at insulating automobile dealers from Tesla Motors' business model. In March 2016, Apodaca led a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly that passed the controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act commonly known as HB2. After this session of congress, Apodaca called on the city of Charlotte to pay the $42,000 cost of the emergency legislative session which led to the bill's passage. After the controversial bill passed, companies such as PayPal withdrew their plans to expand in North Carolina, resulting in the loss of at least four hundred potential jobs for North Carolinians.",

McGroarty was from East End and was born on December 22, 1962. In 1983, McGroarty was elected to Wilkes-Barre City Council and served for twelve years before his election as mayor. McGroarty graduated from Coughlin High School, Luzerne County Community College and Bloomsburg University. He was both an officer and enlisted member of the 109th Field Artillery, where he served as service battery commander. McGroarty was elected mayor in 1995 and re-elected in 1999. He was the only mayor to be elected both as a Democratic and Republican, having waged a successful write in campaign as a Republican in 1995. By securing the both nominations, McGroarty enjoyed relationships with both Democratic and Republicans officials. McGroarty expanded city services in each of the city's twelve neighborhoods. But his main focus became emergency preparedness and recovery, as a result of a blizzard and significant flooding in his first month in office. McGroarty met President William J. Clinton at the White House, and hosted the President during a tour of Wilkes-Barre on February 16, 1996. During his visit, President Clinton announced federal funding for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project, which provided flood protection. Long after McGroarty's departure, those same levees, enhanced on his watch, protected Wilkes-Barre in September 2011, when river levels were 42.66 feet, 1.75 feet above the flood level of Hurricane Agnes.",

He then established a stage coach line from Greenville (modern day Jersey City) to the ferry at Bergen Point. Brady, who was a Democrat, was appointed in 1885 by President Grover Cleveland to be the Postmaster of Bayonne. In 1903, Brady was elected mayor of Bayonne defeating Republican Pierre P.

He was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election, and was re-elected to his council seat twice. His political career, particularly his mayoralty, saw a number of personal and work-related controversies and legal proceedings. In 2013, he became embroiled in a substance abuse scandal, which was widely reported in the national and international media. Following his admission, Ford refused to resign, but City Council handed over certain mayoral powers and office staff to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. Despite the scandal, Ford initially contested the next mayoral election, scheduled for October 2014, but after being hospitalized and diagnosed with an abdominal tumour in September 2014, Ford withdrew from the mayoral race and registered instead to run for his old city council seat. John Tory succeeded him as mayor on December 1, 2014, while Ford regained his former seat. Ford received treatment for the cancer, and was able to return to City Hall for a while, but died in March 2016 after chemotherapy was ineffective.",

One of 5 boys, Brothers - Don, was a pilot and shot down in WWII, John Fiske, Fred Fiske, Leon Fiske, (and 2 sisters who died at birth), Fiske was born in Clarence, Nova Scotia and graduated from high school in Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Growing up on a wood mill run by his father, he began his business career working in the bank. Later to become an entrepreneur, businessman, restaurateur, and motel/hotel owner/operator. He married Claire Longley of Bridgetown, Nova Scotia and has three children, Heather, Alan and Shari. Fiske entered provincial politics in the 1970 election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Donald R. MacLeod by 434 votes in Pictou Centre. On October 28, 1970, Fiske was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Trade and Industry. On July 15, 1971, Gerald Regan shuffled his cabinet, moving Fiske to Minister of Development. He remained as Provincial Secretary until another shuffle in November 1971. Fiske resigned from cabinet prior to an August 1973 cabinet shuffle, and did not seek re-election in 1974. He later served as Chairman of the Nova Scotia Gaming Commission. Although forced to resign due to indiscretions between the Halifax Casino and the government at the time, his claims were found to be truthful. \"When Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation's former chairman Ralph Fiske's wrongful dismissal suit went to trial last May, one canny Halifax lawyer voiced surprise that Fiske planned to call only two witnesses: himself and former finance minister Bill Gillis. Arrayed against him were seventeen members of Nova Scotia's political, bureaucratic, and legal establishment: former premiers, cabinet ministers, and deputy ministers from the premier's office; officials of the gaming corporation; and a clutch of Liberal lawyers from the province's best-connected law firms. Yesterday, Fiske touched home plate in near total victory. Gruchy found that political interference in the gaming corporation's administration of the Sheraton Casino project rendered Fiske's position untenable and forced him to resign. Nova Scotian's should celebrate this moment, rare in our recent history, when a lone civil servant proved that courage and integrity can overcome the mediocrity that corrupts governance in this province. When future civil servants are forced to choose between doing the right thing and the politically easy thing, Fiske's example will beckon them toward duty\"",

  "text" : "Herbert Arthur Sinnott (January 7, 1871 – after 1923) was a Canadian educator, lawyer and municipal politician who served as the 18th mayor of Calgary, Alberta from 1913 to 1915. Sinnott was born in Kings County, New Brunswick on January 7, 1871 to David S., a farmer, and Frances (née Taylor) Sinnott. After attending schools in Sussex, New Brunswick, Sinnott graduated from Mount Allison University with a Bachelor of Arts and started his teaching career in Gagetown as principal of a grammar school. He later taught high school in Moncton, New Brunswick before moving west to Alberta in 1900. In 1903, he became a high school principal in Calgary, the first ever to the city. He began a career in law in 1908, articling under Thomas M. Tweedie. In 1911, he was called to the bar. Around this time, Sinnott also owned and rented out various properties in the city of Calgary as well as Lethbridge. He also served on the Calgary School Board as trustee in 1912 and 1920–22 along with chairman from 1908–11 and 1918–19. Sinnott was elected as Mayor of Calgary and served in this position from January 2, 1913 to January 2, 1915. During his time in office, oil was discovered within the city of Calgary, and it was said that the \"[whole city] quickly became oil conscious\". In January 1923, Sinnott pleaded guilty in a court to \"misappropriating clients' trust funds\" during his work as a lawyer in Calgary. During his trial, Sinnott admitted his guilt and was sentenced to seven years to be served in a Prince Albert, Saskatchewan jail. The magistrate had expressed that \"the more grievous\" crime that of the betrayal of trust of Sinnott to his clients, and that it was unfortunate that such a citizen of high of esteem, had admitted to committing the crimes. The magistrate also expressed that the punishment was decided to set a precedent and to \"deter others from doing the same thing\", along with restating that though it was hard to see \"a citizen of Mr. Sinnott's calibre\" take the sentence, it was a necessary justice. It is not known where Sinnott went after presumably leaving prison, although there have been rumours that he may have moved to Australia shortly thereafter. He married Margaret Horne, a graduate nurse and daughter of a sea captain, in 1901 and had one child with her, Margaret. His wife died in 1906. A conservative in politics, during his time in Calgary, Sinnott was a member of the Ancient Order of Foresters in Calgary as well as the Methodist church. Sinnott was widely regarded for his work in the educational field, with a 1912 biography beginning with \"The educational annals of the Northwest present few names which shine with a brighter luster of good deeds done than the one which forms [this paragraph]\".",

He served as the 14th Governor of Indiana during the American Civil War, and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln. During the war, Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly. He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval, and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans. He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers. As one of President Lincoln's \"war governors\", Morton made signification contributions to the war effort, more than any other man in the state, and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support. During his second term as governor, and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke, he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during his second term in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.",

Nach der Bundestagswahl im September 1998 – Gerhard Schröder wurde Bundeskanzler – übernahm er im Kabinett Schröder I das Bundesministerium der Finanzen. Im März 1999 legte er überraschend alle politischen Ämter – auch sein Bundestagsmandat – nieder und trat fortan als Kritiker des rot-grünen Regierungskurses von Gerhard Schröder auf. 2005 wechselte Lafontaine von der SPD zur neu gegründeten Wahlalternative Arbeit & soziale Gerechtigkeit (WASG). Diese ging durch seine Initiative im Juni 2005 ein Wahlbündnis mit der PDS ein, die sich dafür in Die Linkspartei.PDS umbenannte. Von 2005 bis 2009 war Lafontaine mit Gregor Gysi Fraktionsvorsitzender der Linksfraktion im Deutschen Bundestag. Vom 16. Juni 2007 bis zum 15. Mai 2010 war er neben Lothar Bisky Parteivorsitzender der neugebildeten Partei Die Linke. Sein Rückzug von beiden politischen Ämtern erfolgte aufgrund einer am 17.

His term in office was marked by initiatives that included the acquisition of the Dionne Quintuplets homestead as a community museum, the creation of a heritage train attraction in the city's Waterfront Park, the launch of \"Haleyfest\", a Christmas choral concert which still takes place annually in the city, and other economic development initiatives to revitalize the city's downtown and waterfront areas. During his term as mayor he also ran as an Ontario Liberal Party candidate in Nipissing in the 1990 provincial election, but lost to Mike Harris. He ran for another term as mayor of North Bay in the 2006 municipal election, but was defeated by incumbent mayor Vic Fedeli.

He was born in Hamilton City, (which at the time was a part of Colusa County) the son of Edward Tillotson Reynolds and Frances Elizabeth Barnard Reynolds who were early settlers of Colusa County. Reynolds attended Woodman’s Academy in Chico, and Chico State Normal School, to which he enrolled at the age of seventeen, and continued for two and a half years. He then quit school to work in the fruit and nut business with his father, in 1898, when the firm of E. T. Reynolds and Son was established. Initially, they leased a warehouse, and eventually they bought a warehouse at the corner of First and Cedar Streets in Chico. In 1902, they built another warehouse, which had a railroad spur adjoining it at First and Cherry Streets. This warehouse still existed into the 21st-century, and was part of the Chico State campus under the same name as \"Reynolds Warehouse.\" By 1915, they were the largest handlers of almonds in the state. Their dried fruit business grew to the capacity of thirty-five hundred tons annually. Reynolds, with in partnership with others, owned the Cana Land Company, which comprised two hundred acres of fruit and nuts at Cana. Reynolds married Helen Adelia \"Nellie\" Davisson, in Suisun, in 1908. She was a Chico Normal School graduate, and school teacher until her marriage. In 1915, he was elected from the third ward as a trustee of the city. He served as chairman of the commission on fire, light and water. In 1919, he was elected president of the board of trustees. On June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a Board of Freeholders charged with framing a City Charter. On April 16, 1923, at-large elections were reinstated under the charter. Under the charter, the board of trustees was renamed the Chico City Council, and its chair was titled the Mayor. Reynolds was the last mayor to be titled \"president\" of the \"board of trustees\" before it became the modern Chico City Council.",

According to Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, during FDR's presidency, LeHand became \"the most celebrated private secretary in the country\". Born into a poor Irish-American family in New York, LeHand attended secretarial school, took a series of clerical jobs, and eventually began to work for the Democratic Party's New York office. There she came to the attention of FDR's wife Eleanor during his 1920 vice presidential candidacy and was hired as FDR's personal secretary. After FDR was partially paralyzed by polio, LeHand became his daily companion, to the extent of adopting his favorite hobbies, games, and drinks. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her unable to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Boston and died in 1944. The exact nature of LeHand's relationship with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was engaged to U.S. Ambassador William Bullitt in 1933, but never married, later asking a friend, \"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\"",

Educated in Montreal at Sir George Williams University and Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal, he was a telephone technician. In 1962, he married Claudia June Burns. After serving two years on Halifax County Council, MacKay entered provincial politics in the 1978 election, defeating Liberal incumbent George Doucet in the new Sackville riding. He was re-elected in the 1981 election. In the 1984 election, MacKay was defeated by New Democrat John Holm, finishing third behind Liberal Bill MacDonald. Controversy arose during the campaign, when MacKay admitted he used a false address to claim expenses as a member living away from the capital. In April 1985, an Auditor General's report asked MacKay to repay over $7,000 in extra expenses. The money was paid back and MacKay was not charged criminally. In February 2004, a political comeback bid ended when MacKay's candidacy for the Conservative nomination in Halifax West for the 2004 federal election was rejected by the party. MacKay attempted to return to provincial politics in the 2006 election, running for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in Hants East, but finished third.",

He was pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury from 1964 to 2004. During the 1960s and 1970s Haynes played an active role in the civil rights movement. In 1965, he helped plan Martin Luther King Jr.'s entrance into Boston when he came to speak on Boston Common that spring. The major focus of King's speech on April 23 was school desegregation in Boston. The Haynes Early Education school located in Roxbury was aptly named in his honor. On 9 November 2006, Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun met with members of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Massachusetts at the People's Baptist Church (830 Tremont Street, Boston) to discuss possible collaborations between Northeastern and Lower Roxbury clergy. During the meeting, Reverend Michael E. Haynes suggested the University create a history of the African American community in Lower Roxbury. As a result, President Aoun appointed Joseph D. Warren, at that time Special Assistant to the Director of Government Relations and Community Affairs, to oversee the Lower Roxbury Black History Project. Warren appointed an advisory board consisting of Rev. Michael E.

The family moved to Buffalo in 1911, and when he was 10, Sedita began work by hawking newspapers and shining shoes around the downtown area. He attended Hutchinson Central High School and spent his summers working in canning factories and on farms in Wilson and Lyndonville, New York. He received a B.A. from Canisius College, and in 1931 received his law degree from the University of Buffalo Law School. He married Sarah Vacanti on July 11, 1934. In 1950, Sedita was elected as a City Court judge. He resigned from his job on the City Court bench on September 6, 1957 to pursue his mayoral bid. On November 5, 1957, he was elected mayor, defeating incumbent Steven Pankow. During this term, urban renewal was continued and the Ellicott District Project was completed. He lost his bid for re-election to mayor in the November 7, 1961 election, when Chester A. Kowal was elected mayor. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy nominated Sedita to the post of Federal Customs Collector for the Port of Buffalo; he held that post until May 7, 1965. He was elected as mayor to a second term on November 2, 1965. At the 1966 Democratic State Convention, held in Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, he was nominated to run for New York State Attorney General. He was defeated in the general election by Louis Lefkowitz. In June 1967, during the Buffalo riot at the Michigan Avenue YMCA, the mayor faced an angry crowd of young African Americans during an East Side street confrontation. He was re-elected on November 4, 1969. He ran for Erie County executive in 1971, but was defeated by Edward V. Regan in the general election. Because of health concerns, on February 8, 1973 Sedita submitted a letter of resignation to the Buffalo Common Council, to become effective on March 5, 1973. He died on May 2, 1975, aged 67, and was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery. On December 14, 1987, Buffalo Public School 38 was renamed Frank A. Sedita Community School. Sedita's son, Frank A.

His father, Dr. William Fee moved to Melbourne in 1884, and Frank Fee moved to Melbourne from Franklin, in 1887. He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. He served as city alderman in Fort Pierce from 1904 to 1905, and as mayor from 1905 to 1907. Fee apparently had advanced views for his times. He opposed the death penalty and he supported compulsory education.",

A Republican, Cryer served as the 32nd Mayor of Los Angeles from 1921 to 1929, a period of rapid growth in the city's population. During his administration, the Los Angeles City Hall and Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were built, and the city's population surpassed 1,000,000. Prior and subsequent to serving as mayor, he was a lawyer. Between 1929 and 1931, Cryer became engaged in a widely publicized libel court case with the Reverend Robert P. Shuler, a radio evangelist who accused Cryer of being a \"grafter\" who had entered office a poor man and left office a millionaire.",

He was the New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for the constituency of Saskatoon Sutherland until he was defeated in the 2007 election by the Saskatchewan Party's Joceline Schriemer. Addley was first elected to the Legislature in 1999, and served as Deputy Speaker and chair of the Committee of the Whole from May 2001 to October 2005. He co-authored \"Press Councils and Democracy\" which he presented to the 41st Canadian Regional Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in New Brunswick in July 2002 and was subsequently published in the Parliamentary Review. Appointed in 2000 to the All Party Committee on Tobacco Control, Addley was instrumental in developing recommendations which transformed Saskatchewan's approach to tobacco control including the precedent setting tobacco display ban which eliminated the last legal avenue for tobacco companies to advertise to children. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 in Saskatchewan's favour, the law was emulated across the country and around the world. In 2006 the Lung Association of Saskatchewan presented Addley its Award of Merit for outstanding service in promoting lung health in Saskatchewan. Appointed Legislative Secretary to the Premier on Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment in January 2005, his \"Healthy Choices in a Healthy Community Report\" resulted in the Premier's Project Hope strategy which was honoured by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) for leadership and commitment to the field of addiction. In October 2005 Addley was appointed to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Healthy Living Services and Minister Responsible for Seniors. In May 2007 his Cabinet duties were expanded to include Minister Responsible for Investment Saskatchewan Inc. and Minister Responsible for Information Services Corporation of Saskatchewan. He is married with three children.",

  "text" : "Greg J. Curtis (born October 18, 1960) is a Lobbyist and Attorney from Utah. He is married to Teresa Curtis and the father of six children and eight grandchildren. A Republican, he is a former member of the Utah State House. He formerly represented the state's 49th house district in Sandy and Cottonwood Heights. He formerly served as the Speaker of the House. Curtis was first elected to the State Legislature in 1994, defeating a fellow Republican in the primary. Curtis grew up in his district in Sandy and served a two-year LDS mission to New Zealand. He has worked for a private law firm; as a prosecutor for West Jordan City; and as staff counsel for County Mayor Nancy Workman. Curtis graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in accounting and then received a law degree from the University of Utah. Beginning in October 2008, Curtis was plagued by accusations from several former state employees who claimed that Curtis abused his government position to benefit his legal clients financially. One of these former employees, Doug Clark, claimed that Curtis cut funding and caused layoffs to anyone who opposed his plans to build a public transit facility in the midst of an ancient Native American settlement in Draper, Utah. Changing the location of the proposed facility would have kept land owners in the area from moving forward with subsequent development plans. Clark said that Curtis told him, *“Doug, I am the speaker of the House. If I want something, I get it. ... I want you to talk to DNR to figure out a way to get that road through there. I know this may sound a little strange. You may think it is unethical — because it probably is — because effectively I’m asking you as a state employee to work for me and do work for my law client.” On November 4, 2008, Curtis became the first sitting Speaker of the House in Utah to fail to win re-election in 40 years. Democrat Jay Seegmiller won by over 10% - nearly 1,400 votes. With this result, it became apparent that the public was fed up with Curtis's alleged abuse of power. For the 2009 legislative session, Curtis returned to Utah's Capitol Hill - not as a state representative - but as a lobbyist representing several large companies, including Intermountain Healthcare, UTA, Altria Group, parent company of Philip Morris.",

However, he was an alcoholic and womaniser. During these bouts, he provided secret information about their activities to the British. Hence, he was dismissed from the village by Raju. He took shelter in the house of his lover in 1923. During this time, the British arrested him and prosecuted him with the death sentence. On his appeal, the death sentence was changed in 1924 to life imprisonment at Andaman Jail. He was released in 1937 on the perusal of Congress politicians. In this way, he became the only associate of Raju to survive the British assault.
