  "text" : "John Shields Tipton (* 14. August 1786 bei Sevierville, Tennessee; † 5. April 1839 in Logansport, Indiana) war ein US-amerikanischer Armeeoffizier und Politiker (Demokratische Partei). Er vertrat den Bundesstaat Indiana im US-Senat. Der im heutigen Sevier County geborene Tipton verlor schon früh seinen Vater, der von Indianern getötet wurde. Sein Großonkel, der ebenfalls John Tipton hieß, gehörte zu den prominenten Persönlichkeiten des Gebietes, weshalb er zeitweise zum Ziel von Aktionen der Anhänger eines von Tennessee unabhängigen State of Franklin wurde. Als er 17 Jahre alt war, zog John Tipton ins Harrison County im Indiana-Territorium. Dort heiratete er 1806 Martha Shields; die Ehe wurde 1816 geschieden. Er wurde in seiner neuen Heimat als Farmer tätig und trat einer Miliz bei, die ihn und andere Siedler vor Indianerangriffen schützen sollte. Während der Schlacht bei Tippecanoe kommandierte er die Kompanie der Yellow Jackets; später standen die Indiana Rangers im Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg unter seinem Befehl. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt bekleidete Tipton den Rang eines Majors. Nach dem Friedensschluss wurde er zum Brigadegeneral befördert. In der Folge schlug Tipton eine politische Laufbahn ein. Er war von 1819 bis 1823 Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana; während dieser Zeit gründete er die heutige Stadt Columbus, die ursprünglich den Namen Tiptonia trug. Er gehörte Kommissionen an, in denen über die neue Staatshauptstadt diskutiert wurde, und beteiligte sich an der Beilegung von Grenzstreitigkeiten zwischen Indiana und Illinois. 1823 wurde er United States Indian Agent und führte in dieser Funktion offizielle Verhandlungen mit den Stämmen der Potawatomi und der Miami. Als die Gespräche mit den Potawatomi nicht erfolgreich verliefen, leitete Tipton deren gewaltsame Umsiedlung ins heutige Kansas ein; die Aktion, die mehr als 40 Indianer das Leben kostete, wurde unter dem Namen Potawatomi Trail of Death bekannt. Tipton, der 1825 ein zweites Mal geheiratet hatte, wurde im Jahr 1831 von der Indiana General Assembly zum Nachfolger des verstorbenen US-Senators James Noble gewählt; zwischenzeitlich hatte Robert Hanna dessen Mandat kommissarisch wahrgenommen. Am 9. Dezember 1831 zog Tipton in den Senat ein, wo er nach einer Wiederwahl im folgenden Jahr bis zum 3. März 1839 verblieb. Während dieser Zeit war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Roads and Canals sowie des Committee on Indian Affairs. Aus gesundheitlichen Gründen verzichtete er auf eine erneute Kandidatur; zwei Wochen nach seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Senat verstarb er in Logansport, einer von ihm mitbegründeten Stadt. Das Tipton County in Indiana und dessen Verwaltungssitz Tipton sind nach John Tipton benannt.",

  "text" : "Sir Vernon Haddon Treatt KBE, MM, QC (15 May 1897 – 20 September 1984) was an Australian lawyer, soldier, Rhodes Scholar and politician. Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984.",

He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo.",

O'Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner SS Morro Castle in 1934. O'Conor identified her body which was found face under close to the wreck site. O'Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O'Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor's Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943. Near the end of World War II, O'Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system. O'Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, Hughes served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery.",

  "text" : "Andrew Damien Wilkie (born 8 November 1961, Tamworth, New South Wales, Australia) is an Australian politician and independent federal member for Denison. He has been an army officer and an intelligence analyst. In 2003 Wilkie resigned from his position in Australia's Office of National Assessments intelligence agency in the lead up to the Iraq War, because he said he feared the humanitarian consequences of invasion such as Saddam using his Weapons of Mass Destruction, or assisting terrorists. Following his resignation he said: Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.\" He opposed Australia's contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government and ran for Parliament against John Howard as a Green's Candidate in 2004. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a \"lie\". Since 2003 he has been active in Australian politics. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences. Wilkie finished first on the primary vote at the 2013 federal election and increased his margin.",

He was the first Dominican-American elected to public office in the United States, and the first African American to win the Buffalo Mayoral Democratic Primary but was defeated in the following mayoral election. Eve was elected a New York State Assemblyman in 1966 and by the time of his retirement in 2002 had served in the New York State Assembly (143rd District 1967–82, 141st District 1983–2002) longer than any other incumbent member. As Deputy Speaker, he was the highest ranking African American in the New York State Legislature. During his political career he became a political foe of Western New York politician James D. Griffin and of New York State Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. He was a founding member of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. At the national level, Eve was once one of three alternates to the 15-person 1984 Democratic Party Platform Committee. Eve was an observer and negotiator during the 1971 Attica Prison riot and the first official to enter the facility to hear the demands of the inmates. An advocate for liberal causes such as economic development, education, job training and development, social services, crime prevention and parole reform, day care and housing, Eve was also a leader in the movement to legislate Harriet Tubman Day as a New York State holiday. He is the father of attorney and former candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York Leecia Eve.",
