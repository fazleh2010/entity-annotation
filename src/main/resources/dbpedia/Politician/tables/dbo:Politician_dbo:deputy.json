  "text" : "Nicholas \"Nick\" Xenophon (born Xenophou; 29 January 1959) is an Australian senator for South Australia and the leader of the Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) political party in the Australian Senate. He was first elected to a six-year Senate term in the federal parliament as an independent at the 2007 federal election and was re-elected at the 2013 federal election, before forming the nascent NXT and electing a total of four representatives including one in the lower house at the 2016 federal election. Xenophon was first elected to South Australian parliament at the 1997 state election before an unprecedented result at the 2006 state election, which propelled him to federal parliament. Xenophon first contested a parliamentary seat and was unexpectedly successful at the 1997 state election. Despite an upper house primary vote of just 2.9 percent, his independent No Pokies ticket collected many preferences and reached the upper house electoral quota of 8.3 percent, making him the first successful upper house independent in several decades. Campaigning to retain his seat at the 2006 state election, he received unexpected and unprecedented levels of support, with an upper house primary vote of 20.5 percent, resulting in a total of three successful upper house candidates. A year later he stood down to contest the 2007 federal election and was elected to the Senate with an upper house primary vote of 14.8 percent. This increased to 24.9 percent at the 2013 election. The nascent NXT ran candidates in most states and territories including all South Australian seats at the 2016 federal election. As the election was a double dissolution the Senate electoral quota of 14.3 percent was halved to 7.7 percent. Though NXT's South Australian Senate primary vote was reduced to 21.7 percent, the halved Senate quota resulted in three successful NXT candidates in the upper house alone. NXT was also successful in the South Australian Division of Mayo in the lower house. While his original No Pokies platform centred on an anti-gambling policy, he has since become an advocate in many other policy areas. These include defence, education, health, infrastructure, regional affairs, national security, foreign policy, and civil liberties.",

  "text" : "John Hutchyns Tyndall' (14 July 1934 – 19 July 2005) was a British National Socialist. As a prominent figure in British nationalism during the second half of the twentieth century, Tyndall was involved during the 1960s with neo-Nazi movements, most notably being the deputy leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement under Colin Jordan. However, he is best known for leading the National Front (NF) in the late 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Born in Devon, Tyndall undertook national service prior to reading the work of Adolf Hitler and involving himself in extreme-right politics. In the mid-1950s he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Growing frustrated with the LEL's approach, in 1957 he co-founded the National Labour Party (NLP) with John Bean. In 1960 the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Tyndall grew close to Jordan and together they embraced an overt Neo-Nazi approach to racial nationalism, establishing a paramilitary group called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement. In 1962 he was convicted and imprisoned for establishing a paramilitary organisation. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall then formed his Greater Britain Movement, another explicitly Neo-Nazi group, in 1964. In 1967 Tyndall joined the newly established National Front, which was then led by Chesterton. He took on the role of Vice Chairman and eventually assumed the position of Chairman in 1972. His leadership was however threatened by both a 'populist moderate' faction and a Strasserite faction. In 1974 he was deposed as Chairman and briefly expelled from the party the following year. On his return he resumed his position as Chairman, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980, forming his short-lived New National Front. In 1982 he established the new British National Party, which grew into the most prominent extreme-right group in the UK by the late 1980s. Electoral success however largely eluded the party. Tyndall's refusal to moderate any of the party's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of 'modernisers', who succeeded in ousting him in 1999, when he was replaced by Nick Griffin. Tyndall retained his affiliation with the BNP for the following few years prior to his death.",

  "text" : "Sir Vernon Haddon Treatt KBE, MM, QC (15 May 1897 – 20 September 1984) was an Australian lawyer, soldier, Rhodes Scholar and politician. Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984.",

He resigned as leader after his second election defeat, and was replaced by his former deputy, Jeff Seeney. However, after only 16 months as leader and facing poor opinion polling against Seeney, Springborg replaced him. Following this defeat Springborg played a leading role in the creation of the Liberal National Party (LNP), becoming the party's first leader but resigning after he led it to defeat at the 2009 Queensland election. John-Paul Langbroek was elected as his successor, with Springborg elected as Deputy Leader. Following a move by the LNP organisation to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney respectively. The Newman-led LNP overwhelmingly won the 2012 election and Springborg became Minister for Health in the Newman Cabinet. After the 2015 election, Newman lost his electorate of Ashgrove and Springborg was once again elected leader of the LNP, with Langbroek serving as his deputy as the LNP returned to opposition after one term in office.

In June 2015, Craig resigned as leader of the Conservative Party following allegations of inappropriate behaviour surrounding the party's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor and tensions with the party's governing board. Craig has since admitted to inappropriate conduct with MacGregor but has denied charges of sexual harassment. On 27 June, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party. Since then, his suspension has been invalidated which would enable Craig to contest the Conservative Party's leadership. On 16 November 2015, Craig announced that he would not be contesting the Conservative Party leadership in lieu of a police investigation against him over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election.",

Earlier, between 1987 and 1994, she represented New South Wales in the Senate. Bishop held portfolios in the outer ministry during the first two terms of the Howard Government, serving as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel from 1996 to 1998 and as Minister for Aged Care from 1998 to 2001. In October 2014, she surpassed Kathy Sullivan's record for the longest period of parliamentary service by a woman. From July 2015, Bishop was subject to sustained intense media and public scrutiny regarding her use of parliamentary entitlements, including a helicopter charter to a party fundraiser during her time as speaker. Although Prime Minister Tony Abbott had originally been one of her strongest allies, she eventually lost his support, resigning from the speakership and moving to the backbench on 2 August to be replaced as speaker by Tony Smith. On 16 April 2016, Bishop was defeated by Jason Falinski in a Liberal Party preselection ballot (51 votes to 39) for the Division of Mackellar at the 2016 federal election.",

His political career, particularly his mayoralty, saw a number of personal and work-related controversies and legal proceedings. In 2013, he became embroiled in a substance abuse scandal, which was widely reported in the national and international media. Following his admission, Ford refused to resign, but City Council handed over certain mayoral powers and office staff to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. Despite the scandal, Ford initially contested the next mayoral election, scheduled for October 2014, but after being hospitalized and diagnosed with an abdominal tumour in September 2014, Ford withdrew from the mayoral race and registered instead to run for his old city council seat. John Tory succeeded him as mayor on December 1, 2014, while Ford regained his former seat. Ford received treatment for the cancer, and was able to return to City Hall for a while, but died in March 2016 after chemotherapy was ineffective.",

After working several years as a Solicitor, Robson stood for, and was elected to, parliament on 29 August 1936 at a by-election for the seat of Vaucluse. He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the Second World War and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to lieutenant colonel and receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service. Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1945. When long-time Leader Vernon Treatt resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader Robert Askin and Pat Morton became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974.",

  "text" : "George Lansbury, PC (22 February 1859 – 7 May 1940) was a British politician and social reformer who led the Labour Party from 1932 to 1935. Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929–31, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of social justice, women's rights and world disarmament. Originally a radical Liberal, Lansbury converted to socialism in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to parliament in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women's suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action. In 1912 Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution. These positions contributed to Lansbury's failure to be elected to parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar, and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in the Poplar \"rates revolt\" of 1921. After his return to parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931 Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but stayed with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the party's leader. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 party conference he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.",

Moving to Sydney, Morton first entered politics in 1944 as an Alderman on Mosman Municipal Council, rising to be Mayor in 1946. Morton then entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 3 May 1947, representing the Electoral district of Mosman for the Liberal Party of Australia. Morton soon rose through the party ranks, becoming touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. Morton contested as Leader the 1956 and 1959 elections, gaining seats each time but failing to defeat the long-standing Labor Government. A few months after the 1959 election, Morton was deposed as Leader by now-Deputy Leader Askin in July 1959. He remained on the backbenches until Askin led the Liberal Party to its first electoral victory in May 1965, whereupon Morton was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways. He served in the cabinet, becoming prominent and controversial in his role in the reorganisation of the City of Sydney as Local Government Minister and state planning regulations, until he retired from parliament in June 1972.

  "text" : "Alfred Deakin (3 August 1856 – 7 October 1919) was a leader of the movement for Australian federation and later the second Prime Minister of Australia. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including pro-worker industrial reforms. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia. It is likely that he could have been Premier of Victoria, but he chose to devote his energy to federation. Throughout the 1890s Deakin was a participant in conferences of representatives of the Australian colonies that were established to draft a constitution for the proposed federation. He played an important role in ensuring that the draft was liberal and democratic and in achieving compromises to enable its eventual success. Between conferences, he worked to popularise the concept of federation and campaigned for its acceptance in colonial referenda. He then fought hard to ensure acceptance of the proposed constitution by the Government of the United Kingdom. As Prime Minister, Deakin completed a significant legislative program that makes him, with Labor's Andrew Fisher, the founder of an effective Commonwealth government. He expanded the High Court, provided major funding for the purchase of ships, leading to the establishment of the Royal Australian Navy as a significant force under the Fisher government, and established Australian control of Papua. Confronted by the rising Australian Labor Party in 1909, he merged his Protectionist Party with Joseph Cook's Anti-Socialist Party to create the Commonwealth Liberal Party (known commonly as the Fusion), the main ancestor of the modern Liberal Party of Australia. The Deakin-led Liberal Party government lost to Fisher Labor at the 1910 election, which saw the first time a federal political party had been elected with a majority in either house in Federal Parliament. Deakin resigned from Parliament prior to the 1913 election, with Joseph Cook winning the Liberal Party leadership ballot.",

  "text" : "Andrij Wolodymyrowytsch Parubij (ukrainisch Андрій Володимирович Парубій; * 31. Januar 1971 in Tscherwonohrad) ist ein ukrainischer Politiker (parteilos; ehemals Allukrainische Vereinigung „Vaterland“). Parubij war vom 27. Februar bis 7. August 2014 Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrats der Ukraine. Er war Mitbegründer der rechtsextremen Sozial-Nationalen Partei der Ukraine, des Vorläufers der heutigen Swoboda-Partei und war zeitweise auch in der Führung der nationalistischen Organisation Patriot der Ukraine aktiv. In seiner politischen Laufbahn wechselte er mehrfach die Parteizugehörigkeit, bei den Parlamentswahlen 2012 kandidierte er auf der Liste von Julija Tymoschenkos Vaterlandspartei und wurde erneut in die Werchowna Rada gewählt. Während der Euromaidan-Proteste galt Parubij als „Kommandeur des Maidan“, wobei er eng mit dem Führer des Rechten Sektors, Dmytro Jarosch, kooperierte. Bei der Bildung der Übergangsregierung Jazenjuk im Februar 2014 erhielt Parubij das Amt des Vorsitzenden des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates der Ukraine, von dem er am 7. August 2014 zurücktrat. Während der Krise in der Ukraine 2014 leitete er von April bis August, als der Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates, die Operationen im Osten der Ukraine, die als „Anti-Terror-Operation“ bezeichnet wurden. Während dieser Zeit sprach sich Parubij für die Einführung einer Visumpflicht für russische Staatsbürger aus. Jazenjuk nahm gegenüber der Frage der Visa-Regelung in Brüssel eine vorsichtigere Haltung an, angesichts der Tatsache, dass eine große Zahl der Bürger, in erster Linie im Süden und Osten des Landes, interessiert seien an der Beibehaltung des visumfreien Verkehrs nach Russland, da sie dort arbeiten oder Familie hätten. Bei der Parlamentswahl 2014 kandidiert er auf Platz vier der Volksfront. Nach der Wahl wurde er stellvertretender Parlamentsvorsitzender der Werchowna Rada. Am 14. April 2016 wurde Andrij Parubij in Nachfolge des neuen Ministerpräsidenten Wolodymyr Hrojsman mit 284 Abgeordnetenstimmen zum neuen Parlamentspräsidenten der Werchowna Rada gewählt.",
