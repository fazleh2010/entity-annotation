  "text" : "Gaius Julius Caesar (Classical Latin: [ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar]; 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence. After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\", giving him additional authority. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus. A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.",

  "text" : "William Wilberforce (24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833) was an English politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to eradicate the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he became an Evangelical Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform. In 1787, he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad. In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.",

He was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election, and was re-elected to his council seat twice. His political career, particularly his mayoralty, saw a number of personal and work-related controversies and legal proceedings. In 2013, he became embroiled in a substance abuse scandal, which was widely reported in the national and international media. Following his admission, Ford refused to resign, but City Council handed over certain mayoral powers and office staff to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. Despite the scandal, Ford initially contested the next mayoral election, scheduled for October 2014, but after being hospitalized and diagnosed with an abdominal tumour in September 2014, Ford withdrew from the mayoral race and registered instead to run for his old city council seat. John Tory succeeded him as mayor on December 1, 2014, while Ford regained his former seat. Ford received treatment for the cancer, and was able to return to City Hall for a while, but died in March 2016 after chemotherapy was ineffective.",

  "text" : "خِيرت فيلدرز (بالهولندية: Geert Wilders) (مواليد 6 سبتمبر 1963) هو سياسي يميني هولندي. وهو عضو في مجلس النواب الهولندي منذ 1998، بداية عن حزب الشعب من أجل الحرية والديمقراطية ومنذ 2006 عن حزب من أجل الحرية، وهو حزب أنشأه بنفسه وما يزال يقوده، ويحظى هذا الحزب باربعة وعشرين مقعد من أصل 150 في البرلمان. ويُعرف عن حزبه أنه ذو توجهات عنصرية معادية للأجانب، خصوصاً المسلمين. سبق لخيرت فيلدرز أن وصف المغاربة بالعنصريين، لأنهم في نظره هم سبب المشاكل الإجرامية في هولندا بالإضافة للأتراك. عمل بعد إنهائه دراسته الثانوية في إسرائيل لمدة سنتين، وما يزال يعبر عن إعجابه بإسرائيل وعلاقته بعدد من قياداتها. قال فيلدرز بعد الانتخابات العامة الهولندية 2010 التي حاز حزبه خلالها على ثالث أكبر نسبة من المصوتين أن الأردن ينبغي أن يكون اسمه فلسطين. وأضاف \"الأردن هي فلسطين. تغيير اسمها من شأنه إنها الصراع في الشرق الأوسط وإيجاد وطن بديل للفلسطينيين\". وردت الحكومة الأردنية بوصفها تصريحات فيلدرز بأنها \"ترديد وصدى صوت لليمين الإسرائيلي\". كما قال فيلدرز أن إسرائيل تستحق مكانة خاصة لدى الحكومة الهولندية لأنها تقاتل من أجل \"القدس\" نيابة عنها. \"سقوط القدس في أيدي المسلمين، يعني سقوط أثينا وروما. لذا، إسرائيل هي خط الدفاع الأول عن الغرب. هذا ليس صراع حول الأرض بل معركة أيديولوجية، بين عقلية الغرب المحررة وأيديولوجية الإسلام الهمجية. هناك دولة فلسطينية مستقلة منذ عام 1946، وهي مملكة الأردن.\" طالب فيلدرز الحكومة الهولندية باطلاق اسم فلسطين على الأردن ونقل سفارتها إلى القدس.",
