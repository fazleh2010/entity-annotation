He was New Zealand's second Chinese MP (with the first being Pansy Wong). At the 2005 elections Wang contested the seat of Mt Roskill, and was seventh on ACT's party list. However, he was not returned to Parliament. In the 2008 general election he stood unsuccessfully in the Electorate of Botany for the ACT New Zealand Party. National candidate Pansy Wong filed a complaint to the electoral commission about Wang's billboards which exhorted \"Vote for Wang, get Wang and Wong\" (because Pansy Wong's high rank on the National Party List assured her of a seat in parliament). He was elected Deputy Leader of ACT in April 2014.",
