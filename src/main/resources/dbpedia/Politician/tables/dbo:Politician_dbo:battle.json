  "text" : "خالد مُحيي الدين (17 أغسطس 1922) ضابط سابق في الجيش المصري إبان العصر الملكي وأحد الضباط الأحرار، وعضو سابق في مجلس الشعب المصري، ذو فكر يساري، وهو مؤسس حزب التجمع الوطني التقدمي الوحدوي حتى اعتزاله العمل العام. ولد خالد محيي الدين في كفر شكر في محافظة القليوبية عام 1922. تخرج من الكلية الحربية عام 1940، وفي 1944 أصبح أحد الضباط الذين عرفوا باسم تنظيم الضباط الأحرار والذين انقلبوا على حكم الملك فاروق سنة 1952، وكان وقتها برتبة صاغ، ثم أصبح عضوا في مجلس قيادة الثورة، حصل على بكالوريوس التجارة عام 1951 مثل كثير من الضباط الذين سعوا للحصول على شهادات علمية في علوم مدنية بعد الثورة وتقلدوا مناصب إدارية مدنية في الدولة. وصفه جمال عبد الناصر بالصاغ الأحمر في إشارة إلى توجهات محيى الدين اليسارية وحينما دعا الصاغُ خالد محيي الدين رفاقَه في مارس 1954 إلى العودة لثكناتهم العسكرية لإفساح مجال لإرساء قواعد حكم ديمقراطي نشب خلاف بينه وبين جمال عبدالناصر ومعظم أعضاء مجلس قيادة الثورة استقال على إثره من المجلس، وآثر - ربما تحت ضغوط من جمال عبدالناصر - الابتعاد إلى سويسرا لبعض الوقت. بعد عودته إلى مصر ترشح في انتخابات مجلس الأمة عن دائرة كفر شكر عام 1957 وفاز في تلك الانتخابات، ثم أسس أول جريدة مسائية في العصر الجمهوري وهي جريدة المساء. وشغل منصب أول رئيس للجنة الخاصة التي شكلها مجلس الأمة في مطلع الستينيات لحل مشاكل أهالي النوبة أثناء التهجير. تولى خالد محيي الدين رئاسة مجلس إدارة ورئاسة تحرير دار أخبار اليوم خلال عامي 1964 و1965، وهو أحد مؤسسي مجلس السلام العالمي، ورئيس منطقة الشرق الأوسط، ورئيس اللجنة المصرية للسلام ونزع السلاح. حصل على جائزة لينين للسلام عام 1970 وأسس حزب التجمع العربي الوحدوي في 10 أبريل 1976. اتهمه الرئيس السادات بالعمالة لموسكو، وهي تهمة كانت توجه لعديد من اليساريين العرب في حقبتي السبعينيات والثمانينيات، وفى السنوات التي سبقت اعتزاله السياسى أبى المشاركة في انتخابات رئاسية مزمعة في مصر ليقينه بأن الانتخابات لن تكون نزيهة وأنه مشاركته ستستخدم لتبرير شرعية الرئيس مبارك. يرى البعض في تخليه طوعا عن قيادة حزب التجمع مثالا للحكومة والمعارضة في أهمية التغيير وتداول السلطة. كان عضوا في مجلس الشعب المصري منذ عام 1990 حتى عام 2005 حينما خسر أمام مرشح الاخوان المسلمين. نشر مذكراته في كتاب بعنوان \"الآن أتكلم\". ابن عمه زكريا محيي الدين مؤسس جهاز المخابرات العامة المصرية.",

  "text" : "John Shields Tipton (* 14. August 1786 bei Sevierville, Tennessee; † 5. April 1839 in Logansport, Indiana) war ein US-amerikanischer Armeeoffizier und Politiker (Demokratische Partei). Er vertrat den Bundesstaat Indiana im US-Senat. Der im heutigen Sevier County geborene Tipton verlor schon früh seinen Vater, der von Indianern getötet wurde. Sein Großonkel, der ebenfalls John Tipton hieß, gehörte zu den prominenten Persönlichkeiten des Gebietes, weshalb er zeitweise zum Ziel von Aktionen der Anhänger eines von Tennessee unabhängigen State of Franklin wurde. Als er 17 Jahre alt war, zog John Tipton ins Harrison County im Indiana-Territorium. Dort heiratete er 1806 Martha Shields; die Ehe wurde 1816 geschieden. Er wurde in seiner neuen Heimat als Farmer tätig und trat einer Miliz bei, die ihn und andere Siedler vor Indianerangriffen schützen sollte. Während der Schlacht bei Tippecanoe kommandierte er die Kompanie der Yellow Jackets; später standen die Indiana Rangers im Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg unter seinem Befehl. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt bekleidete Tipton den Rang eines Majors. Nach dem Friedensschluss wurde er zum Brigadegeneral befördert. In der Folge schlug Tipton eine politische Laufbahn ein. Er war von 1819 bis 1823 Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana; während dieser Zeit gründete er die heutige Stadt Columbus, die ursprünglich den Namen Tiptonia trug. Er gehörte Kommissionen an, in denen über die neue Staatshauptstadt diskutiert wurde, und beteiligte sich an der Beilegung von Grenzstreitigkeiten zwischen Indiana und Illinois. 1823 wurde er United States Indian Agent und führte in dieser Funktion offizielle Verhandlungen mit den Stämmen der Potawatomi und der Miami. Als die Gespräche mit den Potawatomi nicht erfolgreich verliefen, leitete Tipton deren gewaltsame Umsiedlung ins heutige Kansas ein; die Aktion, die mehr als 40 Indianer das Leben kostete, wurde unter dem Namen Potawatomi Trail of Death bekannt. Tipton, der 1825 ein zweites Mal geheiratet hatte, wurde im Jahr 1831 von der Indiana General Assembly zum Nachfolger des verstorbenen US-Senators James Noble gewählt; zwischenzeitlich hatte Robert Hanna dessen Mandat kommissarisch wahrgenommen. Am 9. Dezember 1831 zog Tipton in den Senat ein, wo er nach einer Wiederwahl im folgenden Jahr bis zum 3. März 1839 verblieb. Während dieser Zeit war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Roads and Canals sowie des Committee on Indian Affairs. Aus gesundheitlichen Gründen verzichtete er auf eine erneute Kandidatur; zwei Wochen nach seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Senat verstarb er in Logansport, einer von ihm mitbegründeten Stadt. Das Tipton County in Indiana und dessen Verwaltungssitz Tipton sind nach John Tipton benannt.",

  "text" : "Eliphalet Dyer (September 14, 1721 – May 13, 1807) was a lawyer, jurist, and statesman from Windham, Connecticut. He was a delegate for Connecticut to many sessions of the Continental Congress. Eliphalet was born in Windham and attended Yale where he graduated in 1740. He read for the law and was admitted to the bar in 1746. He became a member of the militia, then in 1747 was elected justice of the peace and a member of the colonial assembly. He was also involved in several of the land development schemes for the Susquehanna and Wyoming Valley areas. In the French and Indian War Dyer was a Lt. Colonel in the militia. He was a part of the expedition that captured Crown Point from the French in 1755. In 1758, as a Colonel, he led his regiment to Canada in support of Amherst’s and Wolfe’s operations. In 1763 he visited London as an agent for the Susquehanna Land Company in a failed attempt to gain title for a colonial venture to the Wyoming region. Connecticut sent Dyer to New York for the Stamp Act Congress. This congress of protest was an important precursor to the American Revolution. In 1766 he was elected a justice of Connecticut’s superior court. He would hold that post until 1793, serving as Chief Justice after 1789. As the revolution began, Dyer was named to the state’s Committee of Safety, and named a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1774. He would serve in the Congress during 1774–1775, 1777–1779, and 1782–1783. John Adams, in his diary, characterized Dyer as \"...longwinded and roundabout, obscure and cloudy, very talkative and very tedious, yet an honest, worthy man; means and judges well.\" Eliphalet retired from public life in 1793. He died at home in Windham on May 13, 1807, and is buried in the Windham Cemetery. His daughter Amelia was married to Joseph Trumbull, who served with Dyer in the Continental Congress.",

  "text" : "Waller Taylor (* um 1779 im Lunenburg County, Virginia; †  26. August 1826 ebenda) war ein US-amerikanischer Politiker. Er war einer der beiden ersten US-Senatoren für den Bundesstaat Indiana nach dessen Beitritt zur Union. Waller Taylors genaues Geburtsjahr ist nicht bekannt. Er verbrachte seine Kindheit in Virginia, wo er die öffentlichen Schulen besuchte, die Rechtswissenschaften studierte und in der Folge auch als Jurist praktizierte. Zwischen 1800 und 1802 hatte er als Mitglied des Abgeordnetenhauses von Virginia sein erstes politisches Mandat inne. Im Jahr 1804 zog Taylor nach Vincennes im Indiana-Territorium, wo er ebenfalls eine Kanzlei betrieb. 1807 wurde er zum Richter für Billigkeitsrecht (Chancellor) auf territorialer Ebene ernannt; im selben Jahr trat er der Miliz des Territoriums bei und stieg dort zum Major auf. Er beteiligte sich an Auseinandersetzungen mit Indianern und war von 1809 bis 1810 persönlicher Adjutant von William Henry Harrison während der Kämpfe gegen Tecumseh, wobei er an der Schlacht bei Tippecanoe teilnahm. Taylor blieb bis zum Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg beim Militär und wurde als Adjutant General oberster militärischer Befehlshaber der Streitkräfte des Indiana-Territoriums. Im politischen Bereich gehörte Taylor zu den Befürwortern der Sklaverei, die nach seiner Meinung in Indiana hätte zugelassen werden sollen. Die Pro-Sklaverei-Fraktion war jedoch im Territorium in der Minderheit, sodass im Jahr 1812 auch sein Versuch fehlschlug, als Delegierter ins Repräsentantenhaus der Vereinigten Staaten gewählt zu werden; das Mandat ging an den späteren Gouverneur Jonathan Jennings. Diesen hatte Taylor während des Wahlkampfes zu einem Duell herausgefordert, doch Jennings lehnte ab. Nach der Staatsgründung Indianas wurden Taylor, der den Democratic Republicans angehörte, und James Noble als die beiden ersten US-Senatoren nach Washington D.C. entsandt. Die Amtszeit beider Politiker begann am 11. Dezember 1816, wobei Taylor sich bereits 1818 zur Wiederwahl stellen musste. Er gewann diese und verblieb damit bis zum 3. März 1825 im Kongress. Während dieser Zeit spaltete sich die Demokratisch-Republikanische Partei in mehrere Faktionen auf; Taylor schloss sich dem Flügel um John Quincy Adams und Henry Clay an, aus dem später die National Republican Party entstand. Nach dem Ende seiner politischen Laufbahn kehrte Taylor nach Virginia zurück. Er starb bereits im folgenden Jahr und wurde in Lunenburg beigesetzt.",

He married firstly to the former Olive Chancey (1838–1864) of Clinch County, Georgia, by whom he had two sons who died young. The Bracks removed to Alexandria, Louisiana before the outbreak of the American Civil War. During that conflict, the future mayor served in Company C of the 27th Louisiana Infantry Regiment. After the war, the widowed Brack came to Florida, where he married his second wife Amy (July 5, 1847 - May 25, 1880). They had three daughters before her untimely death: Olive, Bessie, and Josphine Brack. It is unclear exactly when Brack settled in the Orlando area. He was certainly there by October 16, 1873, when he was mentioned as guardian ad litem for the orphans of Mrs. Lucinda Hughey Terrell in a lawsuit filed in the circuit court of Orange County, Florida. In 1875, when Orlando was formally incorporated, Brack was elected its first mayor. He was subsequently re-elected to a second one-year term. After leaving office, the former mayor remained in the Orlando area as a farmer and fruit grower until at least 1880. He was married there to his third wife Eliza Alpha Tyson on March 6, 1881. They had eight children: John Percy (\"Jack\"), Rosa Banner, Gussie, Emma Hortense, Ruby B, Blanche Alice, and Lillian Bell Brack, William Jackson, Jr The Bracks left Orlando to live on the north shore of Lake Tohopekaliga in what is now Osceola County, Florida, where they operated a general store and sawmill at \"Brack's Landing.\" From that point, he also captained a 35-foot sidewheel steamboat called \"Spray\" along the inland canals that connected the Kissimmee River valley to Fort Myers, Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. The former mayor retired to a cattle ranch near Narcoossee, Florida, where he died April 30, 1901. He is buried at Mount Peace Cemetery in Saint Cloud, Florida.",

Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984.",

He was a persistent opponent of the plebeians. When his son, Caeso Quinctius, was convicted and condemned to death, Cincinnatus was forced to live in humble circumstances, working on his own small farm, until an invasion caused him to be called to serve Rome as dictator, an office which he resigned two weeks later, after completing his task of defeating the rival tribes of the Aequians, Sabines, and Volscians. His immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of the crisis has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, civic virtue, lack of personal ambition, and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, many of which are named in his honor.",

  "text" : "(This is a Chinese name; the family name is Li.) Li Hongzhang, GCVO (also romanised as Li Hung-chang) (15 February 1823 – 7 November 1901) was a Chinese politician, general and diplomat of the late Qing dynasty. He quelled several major rebellions and served in important positions in the Qing imperial court, including the Viceroy of Zhili Province. Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonized the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favor with the Chinese after their loss in the 1894 Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military mistakes and praise on the other for his success against the Taiping Rebellion, his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China's industrial and military modernization. He was presented the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria.",

He was the first to write history in Latin. He came of an ancient Plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome and began to follow the cursus honorum: he was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204 BC), aedile (199 BC), praetor (198 BC), junior consul (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and censor (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to preserve Rome's ancestral customs and combat \"degenerate\" Hellenistic influences. His epithet \"Elder\" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.",

  "text" : "Charles-Melchior Arthus, Marquis de Bonchamps (10 May 1760 – 18 October 1793) was a French politician and leader of the Vendéan insurrection of Royalists against the Republic during the French Revolution. Born at Juvardeil, Anjou, he gained his first military experience in the American War of Independence, and on his return to France was made a captain of grenadiers in the French royal army. He was a staunch defender of the French monarchy, and at the outbreak of the Revolution, resigned his command and retired to his château at Saint-Florent-le-Vieil. Shortly before the revolution broke out, Bonchamps feared for his king and country and requested to be reinstated. In the spring of 1793 he was chosen leader by the insurgents of the Vendée, and his directives were able to secure a large amount of supplies and weapons that would greatly aid the counterrevolution. He was present at the taking of Bressuire, Thouars, and of Fontenay-le-Comte - where he was wounded but recovered. Dissensions among their leaders weakened the insurgents, and at the bloody battle of Cholet (October 1793) the Vendéans sustained a severe defeat and Bonchamps was mortally wounded. He died the next day. His last act was the pardoning of five thousand Republican prisoners, whom his troops had sworn to kill in revenge for his death. Bonchamps was one of the best tactical leaders of the Vendéans and his death was an important victory for the republican forces. He was admired by the Christian monarchists and revolutionaries alike. A statue of him by Pierre Jean David stands in the church of Saint-Florent-le-Vieil.",

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" McBride (May 10, 1945 – December 22, 2012) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina.",

Longstreth, a graduate of Princeton University, was an eighth-generation Philadelphian born to Quakers William Collins (b. 1882) and Nella (née Thacher) Longstreth, who married in 1917. William C. Longstreth owned the Longstreth Motor Car Company and his family lived in Haverford, Pennsylvania, and was affluent until the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Thacher was a cousin of President Herbert Hoover and his maternal grandmother, Ella Hoover Thacher was the president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union for many years. In 1970, he led the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and spearheaded the drive to hold the annual Earth Day commemoration in Philadelphia. That event became one of the biggest Earth Day events in the nation. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Greater Delaware Valley Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He was predeceased by his half sister, Nella Cameron Downward (1913-1997). His younger brother, Frank Hoover Longstreth (b. 1922) died in 2008. He was a two-time Republican nominee for Mayor of Philadelphia, first in 1955, losing to Richardson Dilworth, and again in 1971, losing to Frank Rizzo. He was initially elected to Philadelphia's City Council in 1967, resigning his seat to run for Mayor in 1971. While a member of City Council, he served as a sideline reporter on Philadelphia Eagles radio broadcasts on WIP in 1969 and 1970. Longstreth was again elected to Council in 1983, defeating incumbent councilwoman Beatrice Chernock for the at-large seat he had vacated twelve years earlier to run for Mayor. He would remain in office until his death. During his tenure on Council, Longstreth helped support the efforts of Edmund Bacon to bring an urban renaissance to Philadelphia. He was also well known for wearing bow ties and argyle socks. He suffered from Parkinson's disease, and died of a pulmonary embolism while on vacation in Naples, Florida.",

Samoa was easily occupied on 29 August 1914 and Logan became its Military Administrator; he remained in this capacity for the duration of the war. Although he was decorated for his services, his administration of Samoa was later criticised, particularly in relation to the handling of the influenza outbreak of November 1918, which led to 7,500 deaths.

A resident of Cheektowaga, New York, Gorski is a former County Executive of Erie County, New York, which includes Buffalo, New York and many of its suburbs. He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo.",

He received his B.A. degree from Loyola College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1920. While in school, O'Conor was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun from 1919 to 1920. On November 24, 1920, O'Conor married Mary Eugenia Byrnes (1896–1971) and they had five children, Herbert R. Jr., Eugene F., James Patrick, Robert and Mary Patricia. From 1921 to 1922, O'Conor served as the assistant state's attorney for Baltimore. In 1923, he was elected State's Attorney of Baltimore City, and served there until he was elected as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1934. O'Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner SS Morro Castle in 1934. O'Conor identified her body which was found face under close to the wreck site. O'Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O'Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor's Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943. Near the end of World War II, O'Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system. O'Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, Hughes served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery.",

He was the first of nine children of Theodore Titus, and Catharine Flick Howell. He was raised in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. He was enrolled for some time at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but did not graduate. In 1845, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia. Titus was a leader of the Narciso López filibuster expeditions that invaded Cuba in 1850-1851. He was a grocer and sawmill operator in Jacksonville, until migrating with his family to \"Bleeding Kansas\" in April 1856 to join pro-slavery forces. He resided at \"Fort Titus,\" a double-log cabin one mile south of Lecompton, that came under artillery attack from John Brown's raiders on Aug. 16, 1856. He was wounded, captured, and exchanged for Free-State prisoners, before joining filibuster William Walker in Nicaragua in Feb. 1857. After his force was defeated at Castillo Viejo a few weeks later, Titus went to New York. He and his brother Elliot moved to the Sonoita Valley, Arizona, where they operated various ore mines during 1858-1860. Titus returned to Jacksonville during the American Civil War and served as assistant quartermaster in the Florida Militia. He was also working for the Florida Provision Company, a business owned by his father-in-law, Edward S. Hopkins. The firm sold supplies to the Confederate Army. While transporting a load of Confederate draft dodgers to Nassau in 1863, Titus lost his steamer to the Northern blockade and was captured on the Indian River. He eluded imprisonment and later returned to Florida with his family, preceding a post-war wave of newcomers. He moved to New York with his family in 1865, but returned to Florida in November 1867, settling at Sand Point which at that time had a population of 250. Titus built a sawmill, general store and hotel at that location. Titus was appointed postmaster, and soon thereafter renamed the settlement \"Titusville.\" The name of Titusville was determined by a dominoes game with Captain Clark Rice on October 16, 1873. He lobbied tirelessly to have Titusville named as county seat. His efforts were realized on October 7, 1879 when a vote was taken and the result supported relocation of the county seat to Titusville. He was also the Justice of the Peace, a notary public for Volusia County, and a marine insurance underwriter's agent. Rheumatic gout kept him confined to a wheelchair during the last years of his life.",

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014.",

After working several years as a Solicitor, Robson stood for, and was elected to, parliament on 29 August 1936 at a by-election for the seat of Vaucluse. He served many years on the backbenches, he enlisted in the Second World War and served with distinction during the war, gaining promotion to lieutenant colonel and receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service. Returning to politics, he had missed the foundation of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1945. When long-time Leader Vernon Treatt resigned the leadership in 1954 and contests between Deputy Leader Robert Askin and Pat Morton became deadlocked he was asked to stand and was consequently elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. He served little more than a year before he was deposed by Pat Morton. In 1957 he retired from politics and returned to his legal career before retiring. He died of a heart attack in August 1974.",

Born in Tabulum in Northern New South Wales, Bruxner was educated at The Armidale School and started studies at University of Sydney but later dropped out to take up employment as a grazier and station agent in Tenterfield. After serving in the Citizen Military Forces from 1911, Bruxner enlisted into the Australian Light Horse upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Serving with distinction in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Returning to Australia in 1919, Bruxner sold his business and joined the Progressive Party, being elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for Northern Tablelands at the 1920 election. Bruxner came to political prominence when he led the rural \"True Blues\" faction of the Progressive Party that went against their Leader's decision to form a coalition in Sir George Fuller's short-lived government in 1921. Bruxner emerged as the leader of the reduced Progressive Party, which consisted of the members of his faction, but they nevertheless joined with Fuller's Nationalists to form government in 1922. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement. Bruxner resigned the party leadership, now for the renamed Country Party, at the end of 1925. At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England. Bruxner was central in ensuring Alexander Mair became Premier after Stevens was defeated in the house in August 1939. The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party of Australia. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962 and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970.",

In 1873, Fountain moved from El Paso to Mesilla with his wife Mariana Pérez Fountain and their five children. He served the Union Army in California and Arizona during the American Civil War and later as a militia officer defending against raiding Apaches. Later, however, he developed a long and supportive history with several tribes, many Mescaleros calling him a friend. In Mesilla, he worked as assistant district attorney and probate judge as well as a newspaper editor, founding, in 1877, the Mesilla Valley Independent and the Spanish edition El Independiente del Valle de la Mesilla. He also founded the Mesilla Dramatic Society and the Mesilla Valley Opera House, now The Fountain Theater, both originally operated by his family. Following a purge of corruption among cattle rustlers, Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry disappeared near White Sands, New Mexico, where his wagon, stains of blood, and evidence of an ambush were left. Suspicion centered on two rival landowners, Oliver M. Lee and Albert B. Fall. The bodies were never discovered.",
