He represented the old districts 45, 46, and 65, which changed through the years due to legislative redistricting, and included portions of the city of Saint Paul in Ramsey County. Born in Saint Paul, Coleman served as a Signalman 2nd Class in the United States Navy during World War II. He entered politics as a volunteer for the 1948 congressional campaign of Eugene McCarthy, then a professor at the College of St. Thomas (now the University of St. Thomas), where Coleman was a student. He was later Minnesota chair for the 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon Johnson. While in the Senate, Coleman served as an assistant minority leader from 1967 to 1970, as minority leader during the 1971–1972 biennium, and as the first Democrat in 114 years to become majority leader—a position he held from 1973 until leaving the Senate in 1981. The Democrats have held the majority in that chamber of the Minnesota Legislature until January, 2011. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the DFL Party's endorsement for governor in 1970, and for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Coleman was a founder and partner of the advertising agency Coleman-Goff Advertising, later known as Coleman and Christison. He was the father of Chris Coleman, the current mayor of St. Paul, of Minnesota journalist Nick Coleman, and of the Acquisitions Librarian at the Minnesota Historical Society Library, Patrick K. Coleman. Prior to his career in advertising, he was a high school teacher for two years in the rural town of Tyler, MN. Coleman died of leukemia on March 5, 1981. His body lay in state in the Minnesota State Capitol before burial in Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis.",

With the implementation in 1972 of a reapportionment plan that replaced all existing Oregon House districts with new single-member districts, Fadeley represented new District 42 starting with the 1973 legislative session. In 1971 and 1973, she chaired the House Environment and Land Use Committee. During her tenure as the chair, the committee oversaw the passage of Senate Bill 100, Oregon’s pioneering, statewide land-use planning legislation, as well as the Oregon Bottle Bill. The passage of SB 100 prompted the formation of 1000 Friends of Oregon, a watchdog organization committed to the defense of, and advocacy for, the state's land-use program. Later she became a charter member and a national board member of the Older Women's League (OWL), a grassroots organization that advocates for women as they age. After her service in the Oregon Legislative Assembly, Fadeley began a career at the University of Oregon, where she was assistant vice provost. Fadeley was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was married to Edward Fadeley for about 30 years, ending in 1984. During the 1970s, the couple both served in theOregon Legislature — Nancie in the House and Ed in the Senate.

  "text" : "Gaius Julius Caesar (Classical Latin: [ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar]; 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence. After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\", giving him additional authority. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus. A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.",

  "text" : "John Jeremy Thorpe, PC (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the Liberal Party between 1967 and 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, based on his earlier relationship with Norman Scott, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and the furore surrounding it, ended his political career. Thorpe was the son and grandson of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with neither of the main parties attaining a majority (\"Hung parliament\"), Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government. The February 1974 election proved to be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence on the grounds that the prosecution had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.",

A longtime member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party, she served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1991 to 2005 and as a Minister of the Crown from 1993–1999, and 2000-2001. MacPhail was born in Hamilton, Ontario, but has lived in Vancouver for almost three decades. She studied economics at the University of Western Ontario, and later earned a degree in labour studies at the London School of Economics. She has one son. MacPhail was first elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1991 as the MLA for Vancouver-Hastings, and served in the cabinets of three NDP premiers. Under Premier Mike Harcourt, she served as Minister of Social Services from 1993 to 1996. Under Premier Glen Clark she served a short stint as Minister of Social Services, then as Minister of Health from 1996 to 1998. MacPhail's final cabinet position in the Clark government was as Minister of Finance from 1998 to 1999, when she quit the Clark government at a time when it was suffering from increasing dissent and scandal. When Clark eventually quit the NDP leadership, MacPhail ran for NDP leader, but did not attract significant legislative caucus support. She withdrew when it became obvious that Ujjal Dosanjh had an insurmountable lead. Under Dosanjh, she was the Deputy Premier and served as Minister of Labour and later, Minister of Education. The NDP suffered a massive electoral blow in the May 16, 2001 provincial election, winning only two seats—those of MacPhail and Environment Minister Jenny Kwan. MacPhail only held onto her seat by 409 votes. Exactly one month after the election, MacPhail was appointed as the party's interim leader. She was a harsh critic of the new BC Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell. Although the NDP was the only other party in the legislature, it was four seats short of official party status. Despite this, Assembly Speaker Claude Richmond ensured that the NDP was resourced as an opposition and she was recognized by the Speaker as the Leader of the Opposition. MacPhail stepped down as leader in 2003 and was succeeded by Carole James. She remained as parliamentary leader of the NDP until her retirement from politics after the 2005 election. Following her departure from politics, MacPhail married film and television producer James Shavick, and is currently a partner in his production firm Shavick Entertainment. She is a member of the board of OutTV, a Canadian cable television station owned by Shavick Entertainment, and focused on the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. She has also appeared as a member of political panels on As It Happens on CBC Radio.",

De Witt controlled the Netherlands political system from around 1650 until shortly before his death in 1672 working with various factions from nearly all the major cities, especially his hometown, Dordrecht, and the city of birth of his wife, Amsterdam. As a republican he opposed the House of Orange. He was also strongly liberal, preferring lesser power to the central government and more power to the regenten. However, his negligence of the Dutch land army (as the regents focused only on merchant vessels, thinking they could avoid war) proved disastrous when the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar. In the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of three countries, he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague.",

Also, in 2011 Mexican troops raided his property without a warrant and allegedly seized 88 firearms, 2 of which could be linked to homicides by ballistic evidence. Hank's defense lawyer, told the judge that all was political Frameup to prevent him from running for the 2013 state elections, being most of the weapons were planted by the military. The federal judge ruled that the raid was performed without a warrant, and that all evidence against Hank was inadmissible. No formal charges of any crime have ever successfully been leveled against him.",

  "text" : "Johannes Marijnus Antonius Maria (Jan) de Wit (Zevenbergen, 10 mei 1945) is een Nederlands voormalig politicus voor de SP. De Wit was aanvankelijk advocaat en procureur. In zijn woonplaats Heerlen vergaarde hij grote bekendheid met het Actiecomité Ereschuld Mijnwerkers. De SP-afdeling in die plaats werd een van de grootste van Nederland. Van 1982 tot 1996 was De Wit gemeenteraadslid in Heerlen. Van 1995 tot 1998 zat hij in de Eerste Kamer. In 1998 werd hij lid van de Tweede Kamer, waar hij zich vooral bezighield met Justitie, Binnenlandse Zaken en Asielbeleid. Hij zat namens de SP in de parlementaire enquêtecommissie Bouwnijverheid (2002-2003). Hij hield zijn maidenspeech op 17 juni 1998 over het wetsvoorstel Wijziging van de artikelen 140 en 443 van het Wetboek van Strafrecht (Kamerstukken 25638). Hij was voorzitter van de vaste Kamercommissie voor Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid. Zijn vrouw, Riet de Wit was wethouder in Heerlen en regiovoorzitter van de SP in Zuid-Limburg. Bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2006 stond De Wit vierde op de kandidatenlijst van de SP. Hij haalde 9163 stemmen. Op 24 juni 2009 werd Jan de Wit voorzitter van de Tijdelijke commissie onderzoek financieel stelsel, die de oorzaken van de kredietcrisis ging onderzoeken. Deze, vanwege zijn voorzitterschap ook wel de commissie-De Wit genoemde, Tweede Kamercommissie begon op 18 januari 2010 met de openbare verhoren. Op 10 mei 2010 presenteerde De Wit het eerste rapport van de commissie. Dit ging in op de oorzaken van de crisis.

  "text" : "Erich Honecker (German: [ˈeːʁɪç ˈhɔnɛkɐ]; 25 August 1912 – 29 May 1994) was a German politician who, as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, led the German Democratic Republic from 1971 until the weeks preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. From 1976 onward he was also the country's official head of state as chairman of the State Council following Willi Stoph's relinquishment of the post. Honecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned during the Nazi era. Following World War II, he was freed and soon relaunched his political activities, founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955. As the Security Secretary of the Party’s Central Committee in the new East German state, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore responsibility for the \"order to fire\" along the Inner German border. In 1971, he initiated a political power struggle that led, with Soviet support, to his replacing Walter Ulbricht as First Secretary of the Central Committee and as chairman of the state's National Defense Council. Under his command, the country adopted a programme of \"consumer socialism\" and moved toward the international community by normalising relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN, in what is considered one of his greatest political successes. As Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s under the liberalising reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system and was consequently forced to resign by his party in October 1989 as the Communist regime sought to retain its power. Honecker's eighteen years at the helm of the soon-to-collapse German Democratic Republic came to an end. Following German reunification, he escaped to the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991 but was extradited back to Germany a year later to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuses committed by the East German regime. However, the proceedings were abandoned due to illness and he was freed from custody to travel to join his family in exile in Chile, where he died in May 1994 from liver cancer.",

  "text" : "Emmeline Pankhurst (née Goulden; 15 July 1858 – 14 June 1928) was a British political activist and leader of the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote. In 1999 Time named Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating: \"she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back.\" She was widely criticised for her militant tactics, and historians disagree about their effectiveness, but her work is recognised as a crucial element in achieving women's suffrage in Britain. Born in Moss Side, Manchester to politically active parents, Pankhurst was introduced at the age of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years her senior known for supporting women's right to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her sex. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses. In 1903, five years after her husband died, Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an all-women suffrage advocacy organisation dedicated to \"deeds, not words.\" The group identified as independent from – and often in opposition to – political parties. It became known for physical confrontations: its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers. Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists received repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions. As Pankhurst's eldest daughter Christabel took leadership of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew. Eventually the group adopted arson as a tactic, and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family. In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU, among them Pankhurst's daughters Adela and Sylvia. Emmeline was so furious that she \"gave [Adela] a ticket, £20, and a letter of introduction to a suffragette in Australia, and firmly insisted that she emigrate.\" Adela complied and the family rift was never healed. Sylvia became a socialist. With the advent of the First World War, Emmeline and Christabel called an immediate halt to militant suffrage activism in support of the British government's stand against the \"German Peril.\" They urged women to aid industrial production and encouraged young men to fight, becoming prominent figures in the white feather movement. In 1918 the Representation of the People Act granted votes to all men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30. This discrepancy was intended to ensure that men did not become minority voters as a consequence of the huge number of deaths suffered during the First World War.Pankhurst transformed the WSPU machinery into the Women's Party, which was dedicated to promoting women's equality in public life. In her later years, she became concerned with what she perceived as the menace posed by Bolshevism and joined the Conservative Party and was selected as a Conservative Party candidate for Stepney in 1927. She died on 14 June 1928, only weeks before the Conservative government's Representation of the People Act (1928) extended the vote to all women over 21 years of age on 2 July 1928. She was commemorated two years later with a statue in London's Victoria Tower Gardens.",

The unexpected vote total he achieved in the New Hampshire primary and his strong polling in the upcoming Wisconsin primary contributed to Johnson's decision to withdraw from the race, and lured Robert F.

  "text" : "Edson Jonasi Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF, was the Patriotic Front's spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-trained lawyer, and a poet. His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Eddison instead of Edson or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Edson Junior, Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily.",

A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he became an Evangelical Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform. In 1787, he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad. In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.",

  "text" : "Walter Holden Capps (May 5, 1934 – October 28, 1997) was an American politician. He was a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives. Capps lost an election to Andrea Seastrand for the 22nd district in California in 1994, which was a landslide year for the Republicans. While driving home from a campaign event during the summer of 1996, Capps' vehicle was struck by a drunk driver. Capps was seriously injured and was unable to actively campaign until the final few weeks of the race. During his absence from the campaign, his opponent, graciously, didn't make his failing health an issue. Ultimately, despite his absence from the campaign trail, Capps won, even as Bob Dole edged Bill Clinton in the district. Capps died of a heart attack at Dulles Airport only nine months into his term. The Reverend Jesse Jackson attended his funeral. Capps was succeeded by his widow, Lois Capps, who won in a special election in the spring of 1998. Subsequent legislation by Congresswoman Capps has mandated the presence of AEDs in public places. Before entering politics, Capps taught for more than thirty years at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a Professor in the Religious Studies department he helped define the field, and cataloged the growth and changes in his 1995 book Religious Studies: The Making of a Discipline. An anti-war activist during the 1960s, he later initiated a nationally renowned course titled \"Religion and the Impact of Vietnam\" in 1979. His name lives on in the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",

  "text" : "William Dyer (also Dyre) (1609–by 1677) was an early settler of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, a founding settler of both Portsmouth and Newport, and Rhode Island's first Attorney General. He is best known for being the husband of the Quaker martyr, Mary Dyer, who was executed for her Quaker activism. Sailing from England as a young man with his wife, Dyer first settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but like many members of the Boston church became a supporter of the dissident ministers John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, and signed a petition in support of Wheelwright. For doing this, he was disenfranchised and disarmed, and with many other supporters of Hutchinson, he signed the Portsmouth Compact, and settled on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay. Within a year of arriving there, he and others followed William Coddington to the south end of the island where they established the town of Newport. Once in Newport, Dyer was very active in civil affairs, holding a number of offices, particularly those using his clerical skills such as clerk and secretary. The political alignment of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport was in flux for the first decade of government there, and Coddington had gone to England to obtain a commission to keep the island independent with him as governor. By 1651 Dyer and others had greatly tired of Coddington's rule, and he was one of three men who went to England to have Coddington's commission revoked. Being successful, Dyer returned with the news in 1653, but his wife, Mary, who had been there at the same time, remained in England. Mary returned from England in 1657 after being there for five years, and had become a zealous Quaker convert. Banned from Massachusetts, she nevertheless defied the authorities and returned in 1659, being sentenced to hang, but getting a stay of execution while on the gallows. Her last trip to Boston in 1660 resulted in her execution and martyrdom. Following Mary's death, Dyer remarried, and continued his public service, while having some legal entanglements with William Coddington. He was dead by late 1677, though no record for his death has been found.",

He was the MIC President from 1955 to 1973, when he was ousted by party members. Sambanthan was one of the leading Indian leaders who played a prominent role in the independence movement in Malaya. As president of the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) during this important period of transition, he worked closely with Alliance Party leader Tunku Abdul Rahman and they developed a close personal bond. He is credited with three important developments in Malaysian political history: the consolidation of the Malayan (now Malaysian) Indian Congress, its transformation into a mass-based party, and its integral role as a partner in the current ruling alliance. The entry of the MIC into the multi-communal Alliance in 1955 contributed greatly to enhancing the coalition's image as the main representative of the three main communities in Malaya. The finest hour was achieved on 31 August 1957 when Independence was achieved under the Merdeka Agreement, to which Sambanthan was a signatory.",

  "text" : "The Honourable Lynda Maureen Haverstock, CM, SOM (born September 16, 1948) is the former leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, and served as the 19th Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan from 2000 until July 2006. In 2007, she was named President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan. Born Lynda Maureen Ham and raised in Swift Current, Haverstock left high school after grade 10 to raise her infant daughter. As an adult, she returned to school to finish her education, and ultimately earned bachelor's and master's degrees in education, as well as a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Saskatchewan. Haverstock rose to the forefront of the provincial Liberals in 1989 and was the first woman in Saskatchewan's history to lead a political party. She brought the Liberals to realize a healthy increase in support, taking over 23 per cent of the vote in the 1991 provincial election. However, their numbers were spread too thinly across the province to translate into seats. Haverstock was the only Liberal to win a seat, in Saskatoon Greystone. Under her leadership, the party grew significantly: in the 1995 provincial election, it increased its caucus in the Legislative Assembly to eleven, becoming the Official Opposition. The Liberals captured one-third of the popular vote. Faced with of a coalition of Regina Liberals and former Tories who had unsuccessfully challenged her leadership, Haverstock resigned as leader in 1995. She spent the remainder of her legislative term as an independent member. In 1999, she retired from politics. The Liberal Party continued to be divided by internal fighting and several members of the Legislative Assembly, including those who had opposed Haverstock, left in 1997 to join the Saskatchewan Party. The 1999 provincial election reduced the Liberals to three seats in the legislature. Since 2003, they have failed to elect any members. After leaving politics, Haverstock worked briefly as a radio host before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan in 2000. As the Queen's representative, she was instrumental in organizing the province's centennial celebrations in 2005. Haverstock's term in office was extended and she remained Lieutenant Governor until July 31, 2006. During her tenure, she granted patronage to over one-hundred community-based organisations. Dr. Lynda Haverstock is a member of the Order of Canada and the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and has honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Regina, Royal Roads University (Victoria), and Queen's University (Kingston). She is a recipient of the Distinguished Canadian Award and is named among the University of Saskatchewan's 100 Alumni of Influence. In June 2007, she became President/CEO of Tourism Saskatchewan, an arms-length, industry-driven authority responsible, in part, for marketing Saskatchewan as a destination. She has been successful in raising the profile of the organization and broadening awareness of Saskatchewan's tourism sector. Under her direction, the province's first Summit on Tourism was held in September 2007; six President's Task Teams were formed to provide guidance on key challenges and issues; a Quality Assurance Program for the sector was introduced; and the first Tourism Advocacy Day at the provincial legislature was held in November 2011. Between 2006 and 2010, the province's tourism revenues rose from $1.44 billion to $1.68 billion, and increase of 13.5 per cent. Dr. Haverstock sits on the Board of Directors for Shaw Communications. She and her husband Harley Olsen (former CEO of the Office of the Provincial Capital Commission and former Deputy Minister of Municipal Affairs) have four children and nine grandchildren. Her brother Dennis Ham sat as a Conservative in the Saskatchewan assembly.",

He was the first to write history in Latin. He came of an ancient Plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome and began to follow the cursus honorum: he was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204 BC), aedile (199 BC), praetor (198 BC), junior consul (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and censor (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to preserve Rome's ancestral customs and combat \"degenerate\" Hellenistic influences. His epithet \"Elder\" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.",

Born into a wealthy and powerful Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning family, he entered the House of Commons in 1875. He was a land reform agitator, and became leader of the Home Rule League in 1880, insisting on operating independently of the Liberals, and winning great influence by his balancing of constitutional, radical, and economic issues, and by his skillful use of parliamentary procedure. He was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol in 1882 but, a very capable negotiator, was released when he renounced violent extra-Parliamentary action. That same year he reformed the Home Rule League as the Irish Parliamentary Party, which he controlled minutely as Britain's first disciplined democratic party. The hung Parliament of 1885 saw him hold the balance of power between William Gladstone's Liberals and Lord Salisbury's Conservatives. His power was one factor in Gladstone's adoption of Home Rule as the central tenet of the Liberal Party. His reputation peaked in 1889-90 when letters published in The Times linking him to the Phoenix Park murders of 1882 were shown to have been forged by Richard Pigott. However, the Irish Parliamentary Party split in 1890 after the revelation of Parnell's long adulterous love affair, causing many English Liberals (many of them nonconformists) to refuse to work with him, and strong opposition from Catholic bishops. He headed a small minority faction until his death in 1891. Gladstone described him as: \"I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was an intellectual phenomenon.\" Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A.J.P. Taylor says, \"More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation.\"",

  "text" : "Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (8 August 1605 – 30 November 1675), was the first Proprietor and Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland, and ninth Proprietary Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland and the colony of Avalon (in the southeast). His title was \"Cecil Calvert, Second Baron Baltimore, First Lord Proprietary, Earl Palatine of the Provinces of Maryland and Avalon in America\". He received the proprietorship after the death of his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (15 April 1632), for whom it had been intended. Cecil Calvert established and managed the Province of Maryland from his home, Kiplin Hall, in North Yorkshire, England. As an English Roman Catholic, he continued the legacy of his father by promoting religious tolerance in the colony. Maryland became a haven for Catholics in the New World, particularly important at a time of religious persecution in England. Calvert governed Maryland for forty-two years. He also continued to be Lord Proprietor and Governor of Newfoundland for the colony of Avalon. He died in England on 30 November 1675, aged 70 years. He is thought to be buried at St. Giles-in-the-Fields Church, London, UK. The exact location of his grave is unknown, but parish records state he is buried there. A plaque commemorating Cecil Calvert was placed in St. Giles in 1996 by the Governor of Maryland. However, genealogists for Kiplin Hall state, \"A number of the early Calverts were buried at St Giles in the Fields, Charing Cross Road, London. We cannot yet be certain whether Cecil is one of them.\" This is possibly due to poor record keeping of Catholic burials or numerous outbreaks of disease that overwhelmed burial staff and led to confusion in parish registers .",

She re-entered the legislature after winning a by-election on May 11, 2011, in Vancouver-Point Grey, the seat left vacant by Campbell. Her government was re-elected in the 2013 provincial election, but Clark was defeated by David Eby in her own riding of Vancouver-Point Grey.

Llegando a ser a ser elegido diputado federal, alcalde de la ciudad de Fortaleza y con tan sólo 32 años de edad, gobernador de Ceará (1991-1994). Renunció a este último cargo, siendo el 6 de septiembre designado Ministro de Hacienda por el presidente de la República Itamar Franco (ante la renuncia de Rubens Ricupero). Posteriormente dejó el PSDB e ingresó en el más izquierdista Partido Popular Socialista (PPS) para postularse como candidato a la presidencia de la República en las elecciones de 1998 (el tercero más votado, siendo superado por el miembro de su ex partido Fernando Henrique Cardoso que consiguió su reelección en la jefatura del Estado) y en los comicios de 2002 (el cuarto más votado). En esta última ocasión apoyó a Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva en la segunda vuelta, la cual ganó. Ciro Gomes ingresó en el Partido Socialista Brasileño (partido de discretos resultados electorales)y aceptó el cargo de ministro de Integración Nacional en el gobierno de Lula, siendo responsable de la coordinación regional y de obras públicas.

Estuvo casado con Patricia Saboya, actual senadora y su aliada política; y con la famosa actriz brasileña, Patrícia Pillar de quien se separó en 2011.

He was the second son of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (1637–1715) by Jane Lowe, and became his father's heir upon the death of his elder brother Cecil in 1681. The 3rd Lord Baltimore was a devout Roman Catholic, and had lost his title to the Province of Maryland shortly after the events of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which saw the Protestant monarchs William and Mary accede to the British throne. Benedict Calvert would make strenuous attempts to have his family's title to Maryland restored by renouncing Roman Catholicism and joining the Church of England. In February 1715 Benedict became the 4th Baron Baltimore upon the death of his father, and he immediately petitioned King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore died aged 36, outliving his father by just two months. Shortly afterwards the King restored the title to Maryland to Calvert's young son Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.",

  "text" : "William \"Bill\" McBride (May 10, 1945 – December 22, 2012) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he challenged Jeb Bush for Florida governor in the 2002 gubernatorial election. Bush won by a 56 to 43 percent margin, making him the first Republican governor of Florida to serve two terms. McBride had earlier defeated former United States Attorney General Janet Reno in the Democratic primary. McBride was born in Belleville, Illinois and grew up in Leesburg, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1967. While at UF, McBride served as treasurer of Florida Blue Key and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame. McBride served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1971. McBride was awarded a Bronze Star with a Valor device. Upon his return to the United States, McBride taught at Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Upon leaving the Marine Corps, McBride attended the University of Florida Law School. While studying law he fell under the tutelage of Chesterfield Smith, a powerful politically connected Florida attorney and then president of the American Bar Association. McBride left law school for a time to serve as Smith's assistant at the ABA. After graduation, McBride joined Smith's Tampa law firm, Holland & Knight, where he rose in the ranks until becoming managing partner in 1992. McBride's tenure at the helm of Holland & Knight has been the source of some controversy. He is credited with having expanded the firm's size and power and with having helped to make it the seventh-largest firm in the U.S. by number of lawyers employed at the time of his retirement in 2001. At the time the firm ranked 21st in terms of revenue but 98th in terms of profit-per-partner, and had \"become known as a reputable, but flabby, operation, long on underproductive partners and comparatively short on workhorse associates.\" McBride was the father of two children with his wife, Adelaide \"Alex\" Sink, a former statewide president for NationsBank (now Bank of America), former Chief Financial Officer of Florida, and 2010 Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida. Since 2003, Bill McBride was partner with the law firm of Barnett, Bolt, Kirkwood, Long & McBride in Tampa. He was also chair of the board of the investment banking firm Hyde Park Capital Partners, LLC, with offices in Tampa and Charlotte, North Carolina. McBride was a member of the American Law Institute and was a member of the board of directors of the Warrington College of Business Administration's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Florida. McBride was named Mr. Leesburg High while still a student. He attended Boy's State while in school and ran a successful campaign for governor at the event. McBride died on December 22, 2012, after suffering a heart attack while vacationing with his family in Mt Airy, North Carolina.",

As of 2005, she is the chief of the DAP Malacca women's wing, and also represents the constituency of Kota Laksamana in the State Assembly of Malacca. She is also married to the current Chief Minister of the State of Penang who also the Secretary-General of the DAP, YAB Tuan Lim Guan Eng, and is the daughter-in-law of the former Opposition Leader in the Parliament of Malaysia, Lim Kit Siang, who is also of the DAP. In 2005, she suffered a surprise defeat when running for re-election to the DAP Malacca committee, placing second-last, finishing ahead of only her husband. However, while her husband automatically qualified to sit on the committee by virtue of his position as party Secretary-General, Chew did not. Chew was \"saddened by the results\", but said she accepted her defeat. However, Teresa Kok, a DAP Member of Parliament, suggested there was a conspiracy behind the defeat of Lim and Chew in their re-election campaigns. In 2006, it was reported that Chew would become the first Malacca assemblyman to give birth while in office. At the time, Chew had three children with Lim: Rachael, aged 15, Clint, aged 14, and Marcus, aged 11. In 2008, Chew defeated newcomer Lee Kiat Lee for the Kota Laksamana seat where she had 11043 votes while Lee had only 3801 votes.",

As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony.

He was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei. Khomeini was a marja (\"source of emulation\") in Twelver Shia Islam, a Mujtahid or faqih (an expert in Islamic law) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the theory of velayat-e faqih, the \"Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority)\", to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists. This principle (though not known to the wider public before the revolution), was appended to the new Iranian constitution after being put to a referendum. Khomeini called democracy the equivalent of prostitution. He was named Man of the Year in 1979 by American news magazine TIME for his international influence, and has been described as the \"virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\" where he remains a controversial figure. In 1982, Khomeini survived one military coup attempt. Khomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis, his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, and for referring to the United States as the \"Great Satan\". Khomeini has been criticized for these acts and for human rights violations of Iranians (including his ordering of execution of thousands of political prisoners), and the pursuit of victory in the Iran–Iraq War that ultimately proved futile. He has also been lauded as a \"charismatic leader of immense popularity\", a \"champion of Islamic revival\" by Shia scholars, who attempted to establish good relations between Sunnis and Shias, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini held the title of Grand Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. He is generally referred to as Ayatollah Khomeini by others. In Iran, his gold-domed tomb in Tehrān's Behesht-e Zahrāʾ cemetery has become a shrine for his supporters, and he is legally considered \"inviolable\", with Iranians regularly punished for insulting him.",

Daley was Chicago's third consecutive mayor from the working-class, heavily Irish American Bridgeport neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, where he lived his entire life. Daley is remembered for doing much to avoid the declines that some other \"rust belt\" cities like Cleveland, Buffalo and Detroit experienced during the same period. He had a strong base of support in Chicago's Irish Catholic community, and he was treated by national politicians such as Lyndon B. Johnson as a pre-eminent Irish American, with special connections to the Kennedy family. Daley played a major role in the history of the Democratic Party, especially with his support of John F. Kennedy in 1960 and of Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Daley is the father of Richard M. Daley, also a former mayor of Chicago, William M. Daley, a former United States Secretary of Commerce, and John P. Daley, a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. While many members of Daley's administration were charged with corruption and convicted, Daley was never charged with corruption.",

Subsequently, he took on a more disinterested rôle as an adviser to the Crown, seeking neither office nor favour.

  "text" : "Diane Elizabeth Deans is a member of Ottawa City Council, Canada, representing Gloucester-Southgate Ward in the city's southeast, representing more than 49,500 residents. A graduate of the University of Guelph she was active in the Canadian Federation of Students before becoming a staffer on Parliament Hill. Deans was first elected to Ottawa city council in 1994. Prior to Ottawa and its surrounding municipalities were amalgamated in 2001, she faced a tough election against George Barrett. In the 2003 Ottawa election, she handily defeated two lesser-known opponents. After victory in the 2006 Ottawa election, Deans began her fifth term as Councillor for Gloucester-Southgate ward. In the 2010 election, Deans was re-elected in her Gloucester-Southgate Ward. She was once again re-elected in 2014 for her seventh consecutive term. Deans considers herself a centrist member of council but traditionally takes a liberal stance on most issues. In the mid-2000s, Deans' main concern had been the creation of a new branch for the Ottawa Public Library in her rapidly growing ward, now called the Greenboro Library. She also supported by-laws limiting smoking in the city, while not supporting a lawn pesticide bylaw in 2002 and 2005. She has engaged in public clashes with Mayor Bob Chiarelli while advocating for her ward. Deans is the Chairperson of the City's Community and Protective Services Committee of the City of Ottawa. She also sits on the Transportation Committee, the Finance and Economic Development Committee, Member Services Committee, and the Ottawa Community Lands Development Corporation. She is currently co-chair of the Seniors' Roundtable. Deans sought the federal Liberal nomination in the riding of Ottawa South in 2004. She lost to David McGuinty. She was seen as a possible candidate to challenge Chiarelli for the mayoralty in 2006, but chose to run for re-election in Gloucester-Southgate Ward. In March 2007, Diane Deans announced that she had been approached by members of the Ontario Liberal Party urging her to seek the party's nomination for the riding of Ottawa Centre. She received the support of the sitting MPP Richard Patten. On June 4, 2007, she lost the provincial nomination to Yasir Naqvi. Deans was married to former New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Ian Deans for 22 years.",

She was elected to the State Parliament as the Member for Perth in 1993, succeeding Dr Ian Alexander who had retired. She was re-elected in 1996 but did not contest the February 2001 election. Her political career was entirely from the opposition bench, during the premiership of Richard Court. Warnock served as Opposition whip, spokesperson for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and the Arts and spokesperson for Women's Interests and Racing & Gaming. She also served as President of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. In 1996, Warnock and upper house MP Cheryl Davenport steered a controversial pro-choice bill through the parliament—the \"Acts Amendment (Abortion) Bill\", which effectively decriminalised abortion and enabled women to access abortions of pregnancies up to 20 weeks on the basis of informed consent. In 1999 she was named the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. As of 2013, she is the current patron of the Friends of Perth International Arts Festival.

When the province's electoral districts were realigned into single member districts for the 1991 election, Lovick continued to represent Nanaimo, while Pullinger moved to the new neighbouring district of Cowichan-Ladysmith. Lovick was speaker for the British Columbia assembly from 1996 to 1998. He served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Labour and Minister of Aboriginal Affairs from 1998 to 1999, as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs from 1999 to 2000.

The son of Ngāi Tahu leader Te Matenga Taiaroa and Mawera Taiaroa, he was born at Otakau on the Otago Peninsula in the 1830s or early 1840s. He represented the Southern Maori electorate from 1871 to February 1879, when he appointed to the Legislative Council. He was disqualified from the Legislative Council in August 1880 over a technicality, which caused bitterness and resentment among Māori. In 1881 Ihaia Tainui who had held the electorate since 1879 resigned so that Taiaroa could resume the electorate. Taiaroa then held the electorate from 1881 to 1885 when he was again appointed to the Legislative Council, where he served for 20 years until his death. Taiaroa was active in pursuing Ngāi Tahu land claims in Parliament. Taiaroa's son John Taiaroa played all for the All Blacks in their 1884 tour of New South Wales and went on to work as a lawyer in Hastings.",

  "text" : "Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (/ˈsʌlə/; c. 138 BC – 78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro. In Plutarch's Parallel Lives Sulla is paired with the Spartan general and strategist Lysander. Sulla's dictatorship came during a high point in the struggle between optimates and populares, the former seeking to maintain the Senate's oligarchy, and the latter espousing populism. In a dispute over the eastern army command (initially awarded to Sulla by the Senate but reneged at Gaius Marius's intrigues) Sulla unconstitutionally marched his armies into Rome and defeated Marius in battle. After his second march on Rome, he revived the office of dictator which had been inactive since the Second Punic War over a century before, and used his powers to enact a series of reforms to the Roman Constitution, meant to restore the primacy of the Senate and limit tribune power. Sulla's ascension was also marked by political purges in proscriptions. After seeking election to and holding a second consulship, he retired to private life and died shortly after. Sulla's decision to seize power – ironically enabled by his rival's military reforms that bound the army's loyalty with the general rather than to Rome – permanently destabilized the Roman power structure. Later leaders like Julius Caesar would follow his precedent in attaining political power through force.",

While leader of Westminster City Council she oversaw the \"Building Stable Communities\" policy, later described as the \"homes for votes\" scandal and was consequently accused of gerrymandering. The policy was judged illegal by the district auditor, and a surcharge of £27m levied on her in 1996. This was later raised to £42 million with interest and costs. She eventually settled in 2004, paying a \"full and final settlement\" of £12.3 million. Porter moved to Herzliya Pituah, Israel, in 1994 during the inquiry, and returned to London in 2006. She helped establish the Porter Centre for Environmental Studies at Tel Aviv University, which opened its iconic LEED Platinum-graded building in 2014.",

  "text" : "Sir Richard Stafford Cripps, CH, PC, FRS (24 April 1889 – 21 April 1952) was a British Labour politician of the first half of the 20th century. A wealthy barrister by background, he entered Parliament at a by-election in 1931, and was one of a handful of Labour front-benchers to retain his seat in the general election that autumn. He became a leading spokesman for the left and cooperation in a Popular Front with Communists before 1939, in which year he was expelled from the Labour Party. During World War II he served as Ambassador to the USSR (1940–42), during which time he grew wary of the Soviet Union, but achieved great public popularity because of the entry of the USSR into the war, causing him to be seen in 1942 as a potential rival to Churchill for the premiership. He became a member of the War Cabinet of the wartime coalition, but failed in his efforts (the \"Cripps Mission\") to resolve the wartime crisis in India, where his proposals were too radical for Churchill and the cabinet, and too conservative for Gandhi and other Indian leaders. He later served as Minister of Aircraft Production, an important post but outside the inner War Cabinet. Rejoining the Labour Party in 1945, after the war he served in the Attlee Ministry, firstly as President of the Board of Trade and between 1947 and 1950 as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the latter position, Cripps was responsible for laying the foundations of Britain’s post-war economic prosperity, and was, according to historian Kenneth O. Morgan, “the real architect of the rapidly improving economic picture and growing affluence from 1952 onwards.” The economy improved after 1947, benefiting from the American money given through the Marshall Plan, but was hurt by the forced devaluation of the pound in 1949. He kept rationing in place to hold down consumption during an \"age of austerity,\" promoted exports, and maintained full employment with static wages. The public especially respected \"his integrity, competence, and Christian principles.\"",

His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On March 9, 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party.",

  "text" : "Sherwood Hayes Rideout (July 17, 1917 - May 29, 1964) was a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Westmorland from 1962 until his death in 1964. Prior to his election to the Canadian House of Commons, he was the mayor of the City of Moncton. During World War 2, Rideout acted as a train-master and was considered a key figure in the management of the train system and logistics planning that allowed vehicles, supplies and troop transports to be shipped through Moncton (known as the Hub City) to the port in Halifax. A Liberal, he was elected in the 1962 election. Following his death, on a train bound for Moncton from Ottawa, he was succeeded by his widow Margaret, the first woman from New Brunswick to be elected to the House of Commons. Their son George also served in the House of Commons in the 1990s.",

  "text" : "Samuel Smith (ca. 1646 – ca. 1735) was an early settler of Norwalk, Connecticut. He was a deputy of the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut from Norwalk in the May 1691 session. Due to the commonality of the name, and conflicting records, it is difficult to determine the exact origins of Samuel Smith. He was, perhaps, the son of Captain William Smith, a magistrate in Weymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony. He moved to Norwalk as a young man, and he listed among its earliest settlers. His father-in-law, Matthew Marvin, Sr. gave Smith half of his home lot and orchard. In 1672, he owned \"a parcel of land in Indian Field,\" not far from the Norwalk-Westport boundary. He was named a freeman in 1674. In 1679, he served as town treasurer. He was on a committee, along with Matthew Marvin, Sr., and John Bowton to obtain a minister for the settlement, which appointed Reverend Thomas Hanford. He served as a deputy of the Connecticut General Court in 1691. He was a townsman in 1698, 1702, 1706, and 1712. In 1702, he was selectman. In 1680 or 1681 he owned a home-lot of four acres adjacent to Strawberry Hill.",

In February 1652, Camfield sold his home lot in New Haven. That year, he moved to Norwalk, becoming one of the area's original settlers. He lived in Norwalk for fourteen years, becoming one of the settlement's and the colony's prominent citizens. He was a deputy of the Connecticut General Court from Norwalk in 1654. In 1662, he was a magistrate and judge for the court in Fairfield. He was one of the 19 signers of the Petition to King Charles II for the Charter of the Colony. In 1666, Matthew removed to Newark, Province of New Jersey along with Robert Treat, where he was one of the founders of that town. His home lot was located at about the present north-west corner of Washington and Market Streets. Apparent his departure from Norwalk is based upon some dissatisfaction with the union of the New Haven and Hartford colonies. Canfield Island in East Norwalk is named for him. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery.",

His character polarised opinion amongst his contemporaries, \"sow[ing] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands\".

He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname Magnus, \"the Great\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. In mid-60 BC, Pompey joined Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gaius Julius Caesar in the unofficial military-political alliance known as the First Triumvirate, which Pompey's marriage to Caesar's daughter Julia helped secure. After the deaths of Julia and Crassus, Pompey sided with the optimates, the conservative faction of the Roman Senate. Pompey and Caesar then contended for the leadership of the Roman state, leading to a civil war. When Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, he sought refuge in Egypt, where he was assassinated. His career and defeat are significant in Rome's subsequent transformation from Republic to Empire.",

He was the nominee for the Republican and Conservative parties ultimately losing to incumbent Borough President Helen Marshall. Sica's earliest education was at St. Stephen's Elementary School. Sica graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School. He then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts from Pace University (Government and Business), a B.A. from Atlantic Union College (Religion), attended New York Law School, and did religious graduate work with Andrews University. Sica served New York City in various capacities. He worked in the New York City Department of Hospitals, which is now called the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. He was a senior investigator for the New York City Department of Finance, a NYC Housing Authority Assistant, a detective-investigator for the Queens County District Attorney's Office, and Marshal for the City (mayoral appointment). In 1980, Sica's career changed when he became a minister of various Seventh-day Adventist Churches in the city. Prior to running for borough president, Sica ran for the State Assembly's 24th district in 2000, and lost to Mark Weprin (72% to 28%). Sica then went on to run for Council District 23 in 2001 and lost to David Weprin (Mark's brother) 69% to 31%. During his run for the Council District, Sica outlined his wishes to promote a reduction in crime, the lowering of taxes, and reform of the city's education system through increased investment by the state. In the race for the State Assembly, Sica received the support of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party, and the Right to Life. In his 2001 bid for the City Council, he was additionally endorsed by the Independence Party. Sica was unopposed for the Republican and Conservative parties' nomination in the race for Queens Borough President. Additionally, Borough President Helen Marshall ran unopposed for the nomination of the Democratic and Working Families parties. After counting the absentee ballots and affidavit ballots cast either for Marshall or Sica, the result turned out to be seventy-five percent for Marshall and twenty-five percent for Sica. Sica's strongest assembly district was A.D. 23 (comprising Howard Beach, Ozone Park, and Far Rockaway) where he garnered 39% of the votes cast. Sica is married to Naomi (Jungling) Sica, Ed.D. Sica has four adult children and four grandchildren. Sica is active in the American Legion, having served in the Army's Military Police. On September 18, 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to continue representing the Republicans of the 24th Assembly District in the New York Republican State Committee. In October 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and is again serving as its Chaplain.",

The son of a coal miner, Bevan was a lifelong champion of social justice, rights of working people, and democratic socialism. He was a long-time Member of Parliament (MP), representing Ebbw Vale in South Wales for 31 years. He was one of the chief spokesmen for the Labour Party's left wing, and of left-wing British thought generally. His most famous accomplishment came when, as Minister of Health, he spearheaded the establishment of the National Health Service, which was to provide medical care free at point-of-need to all Britons. He resigned when the Attlee government decided to transfer funds from the National Insurance Fund to pay for rearmament. He subsequently became the leader of the left-wing group within the party, which came to be known as \"Bevanite\". Bevan remains one of Wales's most revered politicians. In 2004, over 40 years after his death, he was voted first in a list of 100 Welsh Heroes, having been credited for his contribution to the welfare state.",

Adela was born on 19 June 1885 in Manchester, England, into a politicised family: her father, Richard Pankhurst was a socialist and candidate for Parliament, and her mother Emmeline Pankhurst and sisters Sylvia and Christabel were leaders of the British suffragette movement. Her mother was of Manx descent. Adela attended the all-woman Studley Horticultural College in Warwickshire, and Manchester High School for Girls. As a teenager, Adela became involved in the militant Women's Social and Political Union founded by her mother and sisters. Following estrangement from her family, Adela emigrated to Australia in 1914. She was recruited during World War I as an organiser for the Women's Peace Army in Melbourne by Vida Goldstein. Pankhurst wrote a book called Put Up the Sword, penned a number of anti-war pamphlets and addressed public meetings on her opposition to the war and conscription. In August 1917, Pankhurst was arrested during a march against rising food prices in Melbourne, which had been part of a series of sometimes violent demonstrations, unusual for the time in that they were spearheaded by women. In September 1917, she married Tom Walsh of the Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia, with whom she had a son and five daughters. In 1920, Pankhurst became a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia, from which she was later expelled. She became disillusioned with communism and founded the anti-communist Australian Women's Guild of Empire in 1927. In 1941 Adela became one of the founding members of the right wing and nationalistic Australia First Movement. She visited Japan in 1939 and was arrested and interned in 1942 for her advocacy of peace with Japan.",

  "text" : "Aksel Larsen (August 5, 1897 – January 10, 1972) was a Danish politician who was chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark and chairman and founder of the Socialist People's Party. Larsen became leader of the Communist Party in 1932, and was elected to the Danish Parliament (Rigsdagen) in 1932. Together with other Danish communists, Larsen had to go into hiding in 1941 when the Danish police began arresting all party members. After the liberation of the Second World War Larsen became a minister in the interim government, and subsequently led his party to its best-ever result in the October 1945 election, in which it took 10% of the vote. The election however, resulted in a Liberal government, and Larsen's party was mostly shunned by the other party leaders. Following the rising in Hungary in 1956, Larsen condemned the Soviet Union's action. This led him into conflict with the members of the party leadership who had a greater loyalty to Moscow; a conflict that ended with his expulsion in November 1958. Larsen's reaction was to establish the Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), which, thanks to Larsen's personal popularity, entered parliament at the 1960 election at the expense of the Communists, who from then on played only a very peripheral role in Danish politics. Aksel Larsen -- who was especially in later years highly respected among politicians, even if his party was seen as somewhat irresponsible -- remained as leader of the Socialists until 1968, when he handed over to Sigurd Ømann. He remained an MP until his death in 1972. In 2005, the Danish Institute for International Studies concluded that Larsen held a secret working relationship between 1958 and 1964 with one of Denmark's allied partners in the Cold War, stating that \"Larsen... obviously was an agent of a Western intelligence service.\"",

In 2001, Brolly was elected as a councillor to Limavady Borough Council for the electoral area of Benbradagh. She topped the first preference votes with 1056, and her husband came in second with 917. He was also elected to the Council. The quota was 840. In 2003, Brolly took over from George Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) as the Mayor of Limavady. At Christmas 2003 she was asked to switch on the Christmas tree lights for Burnfoot. There was a small Loyalist protest during the switching-on of the lights because of the election of a Sinn Féin mayor. Afterwards, the tree was cut down by vandals and the lights smashed. On 14 June 2004 Councillor Brolly stood down as Mayor. In October 2004, the High Court of Northern Ireland ordered the government to provide the Brolly couple with protection, following reports of threats from the Red Hand Defenders, a Loyalist paramilitary group. In 2005, she was re-elected to the Council, but this time for the Limavady Town electoral area. She garnered 657 first preference votes, a total of 17.6% of the vote. She was the only Sinn Féin councillor elected in that area, coming third behind George Robinson and Alan Robinson both of the DUP. In January 2008, Brolly and another councillor were confronted by a crowd in an \"extremely nasty mood\" outside the council's offices. Police were called.",
