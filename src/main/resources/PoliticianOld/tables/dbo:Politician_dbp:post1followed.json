Following his retirement from Royal Insurance, he became a private insurance consultant for a number of years. In the 1999 election, he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster as a Progressive Conservative and shortly afterwards became the New Brunswick Minister of Labour. In 2000, he became minister for the new Department of Training and Employment Development, a portfolio which encompassed much of his old labour portfolio as well as some social welfare programs and community colleges. McFarlane was defeated in the 2003 election and left the cabinet as a result. McFarlane lost his seat to Liberal Abel LeBlanc. McFarlane promptly returned to politics in 2004 when he was elected mayor of Saint John by defeating incumbent Shirley McAlary by a margin of over 25%. Ironically, one of McAlary's key backers was Abel LeBlanc. Mayor McFarlane faced severe and lasting criticism and allegations of corruption and incompetence for his role in granting Irving Oil tax concessions in 2005, concessions that have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.",

He currently represents the riding of Fundy-The Isles-Saint John West in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. Rick lives in St. George with his wife and two children, Nicole and Jonathan. Doucet has had a varied career working in the air industry both as a marketing and sales official with a commercial airline and later as a cargo pilot. He started his own series of businesses in 1989 eventually working simultaneously in the restaurant, photography and advertising industries. A Liberal, he was a member of the opposition shadow cabinet. He was critic for the Department of Energy from his first election in June 2003 until becoming critic for Fisheries & Aquaculture in February, 2005. Doucet received favourable media attention when, shortly following his appointment as Energy Critic, he toured the province to visit all of its power generation facilities at his own expense. He was re-elected in the 2006 election following which he joined the cabinet. One October 3, 2006 he was sworn in as Minister of Fisheries under the Shawn Graham government. He maintained this role throughout all of the four years the Liberals were in government. Despite the losses received by the Shawn Graham Liberals in the 2010 provincial election, Doucet retained his seat, beating out the Progressive Conservative candidate Sharon Tucker. Doucet would sit in Opposition from 2010 to 2014, with his riding remaining the only Liberal controlled riding in southwestern New Brunswick. During his time in Opposition, Doucet was critic, at various periods, of Energy, Transportation and Public Safety. As critic for Public Safety, Doucet was very vocal in his displeasure with the Government's reaction to the flooding of December 2010 and Hurricane Arthur in July 2014. In the 2014 election, Doucet's riding was affected by the 2013 electoral redistribution in New Brunswick. For this election, Doucet's principal challenger was incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA Jim Parrott. On September 22, 2014 Doucet was re-elected for a 4th consecutive time.",

She resigned her seat on council upon being elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1991 provincial election. A member of Frank McKenna's Liberal Party, she was immediately named to cabinet and became deputy premier in 1994. She served in a variety of roles in cabinet until the defeat of the Liberals in the 1999 election. She defeated PC candidate Robert N. Stairs to retain her seat in Bathurst, one of only 10 Liberals to survive what was their worst ever electoral defeat. In opposition she was a top critic and the media reported she had lost the vote in her caucus to become interim leader of her party by a margin of 4-3 following the resignation of Camille Thériault. Her most high-profile role in opposition was that of finance critic. She did not seek re-election to the legislature in 2003 but has remained active in her party. She was elected vice president of the New Brunswick Liberal Association on October 4, 2003 and re-elected on October 15, 2005. During the 2004 federal election, she was co-chair of the Liberal campaign in New Brunswick. She was the Liberal candidate for the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Acadie—Bathurst in the 2006 federal election, but finished second to Yvon Godin of the New Democratic Party. She served as co-chair of the successful Liberal campaign as it prepared for the 2006 provincial election. She succeeded Greg Byrne as president of the New Brunswick Liberal Party when he resigned after being appointed to the cabinet following the 2006 election and served the post until stepping down in the Fall of 2007.",
