  "text" : "Gaius Julius Caesar (Classical Latin: [ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar]; 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence. After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\", giving him additional authority. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus. A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.",

She served as Member of the European Parliament for Tyne South and Wear and Tyne and Wear successively from 1979 to 1989, and entered the House of Commons in the 1987 election as Member of Parliament for Gateshead East.

Quin served as prisons minister, Minister for Europe, and as a junior agriculture minister. She asked to retire as a minister in 2001 to concentrate on her constituency interests. She had intended to stand for membership of a North East Regional Assembly on her retirement from Westminster, but the proposed body was rejected by a margin of 4–1 in a referendum in November 2004. In April 2006, it was announced that Quin had been nominated for a life peerage by the Labour Party. On 30 May, she was created Baroness Quin, of Gateshead in the County of Tyne and Wear. In November 2007, she was appointed Chair of the Franco-British Council (British Section). She was appointed a shadow Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister by Harriet Harman in May 2010, and was retained in that role by Ed Miliband after his election as Leader of the Labour Party.

He was the Labour candidate for directly elected Mayor of Tower Hamlets in 2014, receiving backing from Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone. Livingstone supported incumbent Lutfur Rahman in 2010, but shifted his support to Biggs after an investigation into allegations of \"mismanagement and fraud\" by the current mayor's team at the council. However, Livingstone also remained supportive of Rahman. Biggs came second in the election to Rahman, but the election was subsequently over-turned by an election court. On 11 June 2015 Biggs was elected mayor of Tower Hamlets after Rahman was found by the court to have broken election law and was stripped of office. Biggs beat independent Rabina Khan, who was endorsed by the disqualified Rahman.",

Ellis attended the University of North Carolina, studied law under Richmond Mumford Pearson, practiced law, and was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly from Rowan County. He served as a state superior court judge from 1848 to 1858. He was elected Governor in 1858 by a large majority over Duncan K. McRae, a Democrat supported by remnants of the Whig Party. Ellis was easily re-elected in 1860 over John Pool. As the American Civil War was beginning, President Abraham Lincoln requested troops from North Carolina to quell the rebellion. Ellis replied, “I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.” During the start of the U.S. Civil War Governor John Willis Ellis ordered cadets from the North Carolina Military Academy to Raleigh, North Carolina to serve as drill masters. Shortly after North Carolina seceded from the Union, Ellis died in office. The Speaker of the North Carolina Senate, Henry T. Clark, completed his term. He is buried at the Old English Cemetery in Salisbury, North Carolina.",

He was born near Elizabeth City, North Carolina and was tutored at home until his attendance at the University of North Carolina, where he studied law. He graduated and was admitted to the bar in 1847, practicing in his home city until serving in the North Carolina Senate in 1856 and 1858. Pool ran against Gov. John W. Ellis in the 1860 election as head of the \"Opposition Party,\" which consisted primarily of former Whigs, like himself. With the war weariness increasing in civilian parts of the Confederacy during 1863, pro-Union activities began to become organized as resistance. The Loyal Order of the Heroes of America, also known as the \"Red Strings\", were started by several men from North Carolina, including Henderson Adams, North Carolina's State Auditor during this time. The actual leader was John Pool, who spent some time in a jail in Richmond, and who traveled through western Virginia in 1864. He was elected by the legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate as a Republican once North Carolina was readmitted in 1868. After his single term, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. until his death in 1884. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.",

De Witt controlled the Netherlands political system from around 1650 until shortly before his death in 1672 working with various factions from nearly all the major cities, especially his hometown, Dordrecht, and the city of birth of his wife, Amsterdam. As a republican he opposed the House of Orange. He was also strongly liberal, preferring lesser power to the central government and more power to the regenten. However, his negligence of the Dutch land army (as the regents focused only on merchant vessels, thinking they could avoid war) proved disastrous when the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar. In the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of three countries, he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague.",

He was appointed as Governor of Zeylan on 24 March 1646 and was Governor until 26 February 1650. He was succeeded by Jacob van Kittensteyn. Maetsuycker studied law in Leuven, and was a lawyer first in The Hague, and later in Amsterdam. From 1636, he lived in the Dutch East Indies. In 1646 he became the third Dutch Governor of Zeylan, and seven years later, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. He stayed on that post for 25 years, which is the longest period for any Governor-General. The Dutch colony in the Indies flourished under Maetsuycker. Under his rule, the Portuguese lost Ceylon (1658), the coast of Coromandel (1658) and Malabar (1663); Makassar was conquered (1667), the west coast of Sumatra was occupied, and the first expedition to the interior of Java was held. In 1663 his wife, Haesje Berckmans, died. In 1664, he married the 24-year-old Elisabeth Abbema, daughter of the preacher Fredericus Abbema and widow of Simon Cos, governor of Ambon. In 1671 the splendour-loving Elisabeth rose some controversy when she had gold coins imported from Japan, outside the VOC. Her aim was to have her brother-in-law in Suratte buy them.",

His positions created a rift between him and the Indiana General Assembly who overrode all of his anti-banking vetoes. He responded by launching legal challenges to the acts, but was ruled against by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state's second constitutional convention was held during 1850-1851 in which the current Constitution of Indiana was drafted. He was a supporter of the new constitution and gave speeches around the state urging its adoption. He was opposed throughout his term by Senator Jesse D. Bright, the leader of the state Democratic Party. After his term as governor, he was appointed to serve as United States Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia where he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although he was a Democrat, he was openly pro-Union during the war, and was elected to serve as a United States Senator, filling the term of Copperhead Jesse D. Bright, who was expelled from the Senate for disloyalty. Following the war he was reappointed to his ambassadorial post where he remained until his death in Berlin, Prussia.",

He moved to British Columbia in 1862, with a cousin, nearly perishing on the trip to the northern Cariboo region. Reid eventually prospered as a miner and established his own business empire in Quesnellemouth (now Quesnel). In 1883, he married Charlotte Clarke. Reid’s business included saw and flour mills, mining operations, riverboat construction and the main general store in Quesnel. Reid owned his own riverboat, the Charlotte which was one of the main supply vessels into the area. Reid was elected to Member of Parliament for Cariboo as a Liberal-Conservative in an 1881 by-election on the death of incumbent MP Joshua Spencer Thompson. He was acclaimed in the following federal election and re-elected in 1887. Prime Minister Macdonald appointed Reid to the Senate in 1888. He held that office until his death in Vancouver in 1904.",

Atwater moved to Florida at the age of 4 and grew up in North Palm Beach, Florida, where his father, a veteran World War II pilot and FBI agent, served as police chief. He went on to gain substantial experience in banking, and was elected to the North Palm Beach Village Council in 1993. Later, he served as chairman, president, and CEO of the Barnett Bank of Broward County and the Treasure Coast, and later as market president of Riverside National Bank for Palm Beach and Broward counties. In 2000, Atwater ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 83rd District, defeating Democratic nominee Pam Dunston and independent Michael I. Danchuk. After just two years in the House, he ran for the Florida Senate from the 25th District, which included Palm Beach and Broward counties. Unopposed in the primary election, Atwater faced off against long-serving Democratic Attorney General of Florida Bob Butterworth in the general election, and, aided by then-Governor Jeb Bush's strong performance that year, defeated Butterworth by a solid margin. He was re-elected in 2004 with no opposition, and again in 2008, when he defeated Democrat Linda Bird, a realtor. From 2008 to 2010, he was the president of the Florida Senate. Following the decision by then-Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink to run for governor rather than seek re-election, Atwater jumped into the race to succeed Sink. In the general election, Atwater faced off against former State Representative Loranne Ausley, whom he defeated, 57.3 to 38.9. Though considered as a frontrunner, in April 2015, he declined to run for the US Senate seat Marco Rubio is expected to vacate before the Senate elections, 2016 to run for the US Presidency. Atwater has since changed his mind, stating that he may run in the upcoming 2016 Senate election.",

Born and raised in New London, Wisconsin, Voight received his Bachelor of Science from the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh in 1971. After serving as an Army sergeant from 1968–70, he moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where he established an insurance agency. Voight served on the Appleton City Council from 1983–1993, holding the position of council president from 1992 - 1993. When incumbent Treasurer Cathy Zeuske ran in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in 1994, Voight ran as the Republican nominee to replace her. He was elected that year, and re-elected in 1998 and 2002. He was defeated for re-election on November 7, 2006, by Democrat Dawn Marie Sass, a former parole officer and AFSCME union activist, now working as a clerk at the department store Boston Store, in what was considered an upset. Voight had defeated Sass in both 1998 and 2002, and Sass said she spent less than $4000 on the race, most out of her own pocket. Voight held the position of president of the National Association of State Treasurers in 1997. In May 2009, Voight announced his interest in seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in 2010, but instead, the following June Voight announced he was going to run to replace retiring Outagamie County Executive Toby Paltzer. On April 5, 2011, he was defeated by former Assemblyman and unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor Tom Nelson, by roughly 52% - 48%. Voight blamed the political unrest stemming from Governor Scott Walker's policy drive to eliminate public workers' collective bargaining powers, saying \"The labor movement has not only energized the Democratic Party base but a lot of the independents.\"",

A backbencher throughout his 20 years in state politics, he was Secretary of the Parliamentary Labor Party from 1998 to 2001 and Chair of the Select Committee on Travel Safe from 2001 to 2008. During his last term of parliament, Pearce took several months leave to receive treatment for depression. He retired at the 2009 state election. After recovering from his illness, Pearce returned to politics, gaining pre-selection to contest the seat of Mirani at the 2012 Queensland State Election, although he failed to gain the seat. Pearce was once again endorsed as the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Mirani in 2014, and this time was successful. Pearce was born in the Sydney suburb of Paddington. Prior to entering politics, he was a coal miner. He was also a Broadsound Shire councillor and served as a Corporal in the Vietnam War. Pearce has three sons.",

In his early life, Taylor lived in various countries and studied languages in Germany. He worked as a merchant and got married when he returned to England. Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

In 1993 he was elected as a Reform Member of Parliament in the Saskatchewan riding of Kindersley—Lloydminster. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 until 1995. Due to redistribution his hometown was located in the new constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar for the 1997 election. He ran against fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party for the new seat and lost. Hermanson sought the leadership of the newly founded Saskatchewan Party in 1998, and defeated Rod Gantefoer and Yogi Huyghebaert in a one member one vote election. He was elected to the provincial legislature for Rosetown-Biggar in the 1999 provincial election and became Leader of the Opposition. While the party reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party to a minority government, it was almost nonexistent outside the rural areas; it was completely shut out in Regina and won only one seat in Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party five seats short of making Hermanson Premier. Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in 2003. However, he came up short again in the provincial election that November, in which the NDP actually won a bare majority. While the Saskatchewan Party scored a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election and was subsequently succeeded by Brad Wall. Hermanson remained the MLA for the new constituency of Rosetown-Elrose. On Friday, June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature.",

He was the ninth and youngest son of the reverent. He fought in the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s, and was a Major in the Territorial Army. On 28 April 1868, Hamlin married Sarah Grace Barriball, the daughter of Charles Barriball of Waiuku, at his father's house near Waiuku (Barriball Road in Waiuku commemorates the location of the family's land). Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Remuera on 4 June 1900. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and seven daughters.",

As well he operated a large retail business, with hardware, clothing, footwear and grocery stores in Chatham, and general stores in smaller communities in outlying villages. Loggie was also a shipowner and bought and exported lumber. Loggie sat as the Liberal Party of New Brunswick representative in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for the riding of Northumberland from 1903 to 1904 when he resigned to run for the Canadian House of Commons in the general elections of 1904. A Liberal, he represented the riding of Northumberland from 1904 until 1917 when, as a result of the Conscription Crisis he ran for re-election as a Unionist supporting Sir Robert Borden's government. He did not run for re-election in 1921, retiring to private life. When W. S. Loggie died in 1944, his son, J. Kerr Loggie, took over as president of W. S. Loggie and Sons. Kerr's health was failing by 1946 and his brother, Leigh Loggie, returned from the Peace River Country of Alberta where he operated a fur trading business and general store. He operated the company until his death in 1977. As Leigh was a bachelor, the business was wound down at his passing. W. S. Loggie's three-story Victorian Mansion on Wellington Street in Chatham is now a cultural centre.",

He served four years' apprenticeship at this trade, receiving in wages five dollars a month the first year; eight dollars a month the second year, twelve the third year and twenty the fourth. A few months before his time expired the works were destroyed by fire. Eba then found employment as a second clerk on a steamboat plying between Pittsburgh and Wheeling, West Virginia. In July, 1852, he removed to Kentucky, landing at Catlettsburg, July 3, and becoming salesman there in the general store. During the Civil War, Eba enlisted in Company I, Fifth West Virginia Regiment; was promoted to sergeant-major, March, 1862; first lieutenant. He declined the post of adjutant after being acting adjutant two months. He was commissioned a month later by Governor Pierpont captain of Company F, same regiment. He was in various engagements, but none of the great battles of the war. Once his shoulder-strap was shot off, but he was never wounded. Eba was mayor of Ashland one term, and then became city truant officer. He died on August 31, 1911.",

In 2015 she announced that she would not seek re-election to the London Assembly at the 2016 elections.

When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled.",

Once known as President Nixon's \"hatchet man,\" Colson gained notoriety at the height of the Watergate scandal, for being named as one of the Watergate Seven, and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for attempting to defame Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg. In 1974, he served seven months in the federal Maxwell Prison in Alabama as the first member of the Nixon administration to be incarcerated for Watergate-related charges. Colson became a Christian in 1973. His mid-life conversion to Christianity sparked a radical life change that led to the founding of his non-profit ministry Prison Fellowship and to a focus on Christian worldview teaching and training. Colson was also a public speaker and the author of more than 30 books. He was the founder and chairman of The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which is \"a research, study, and networking center for growing in a Christian worldview\", and while he was alive included Colson's daily radio commentary, BreakPoint, which was heard in its original format on more than 1,400 outlets across the United States. Colson was a principal signer of the 1994 Evangelicals and Catholics Together ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholic leaders in the United States. Colson received 15 honorary doctorates, and in 1993 was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the world's largest annual award (over US$1 million) in the field of religion, given to a person who \"has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension\". He donated this prize to further the work of Prison Fellowship, as he did all his speaking fees and royalties. In 2008, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush.",

Molloy first entered Queensland state parliament as one of a number of newly elected Labor MPs following the party's landslide win at the 2001 state election. She was subsequently re-elected at the 2004 state election. In 2006, Molloy publicly opposed her party's policy to build a dam on the Mary River. This stance resulted in her disendorsement as a Labor Party candidate in June 2006. She continued to sit as a Labor MP before quitting the party in August 2006. Thereafter, Molloy sat out the remainder of her term as an independent before being defeated at the 2006 state election. The following year, Molloy unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Wide Bay, also in an independent capacity. In the 2009 state election, she unsuccessfully re-contested Noosa. Molloy was born in East Melbourne, Victoria. She was married to Ivan Molloy, who was the endorsed Labor candidate for Fairfax at the 2004 federal election.",

He has served as president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association and was the state chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. On 13 May 2014, Davis was sacked from Cabinet in response to his speaking against the government on a number of matters. Premier Campbell Newman said Davis had failed to observe the convention that cabinet members and assistant ministers are bound by collective decision making. Although Davis initially stated that he intended to retire at the next state election, he resigned from the Parliament on 23 May 2014. A 2014 Stafford by-election was held on Saturday 19 July 2014. On 25 July 2014, in an interview on the ABC's 7.30 Queensland, Davis stated that he had resigned from the Liberal National Party and had spoken to Australian Labor Party state secretary Anthony Chisholm about the potential for continuing his political career with Labor, potentially running in Newman's seat of Ashgrove. The following day, Leader of the Opposition Annastacia Palaszczuk stated that Davis was not a member of the Labor Party and would not be running as a Labor candidate. On the same day, Davis submitted his application to join the Labor Party, and also stated that he was interested in federal politics if he was unsuccessful in obtaining a state seat.",

His military experiences in Korea, particularly with the Mobile Laundry and Bath Unit (MLBU), are recounted in his book MLBU Full Monty in Korea (ISBN 1-894263-85-5). He was elected in the Nanaimo—Cowichan electoral district for the Reform Party in the 1993 general election. In 1996, he attracted controversy when he stated in a newspaper interview that store owners should be free to move gays and blacks \"to the back of the shop\", or even to fire them, if the presence of that individual offended a bigoted customer. Ringma was suspended from the Reform Party caucus for several months after fellow MP Jan Brown spoke out against the prominence of extremist views in the party (although Brown herself was also suspended.) Ringma left politics after serving in the 35th Canadian Parliament and retired to Thetis Island, British Columbia. Ringma had three children with his wife Paula MacDowell. He died on 31 March 2014, aged 85.",

Januar 1938 in Kyōto) ist ein japanischer Politiker, Präsident des Unterhauses ehemaliger Generalsekretär der Liberaldemokratischen Partei und mehrfacher Minister. Innerhalb der Partei führte er von 2005 bis 2012 die Ibuki-Faktion (offiziell: Shisuikai). Ibuki studierte bis 1960 Wirtschaftswissenschaften an der Universität Kyōto. Anschließend war er Beamter im Finanzministerium. 1983 wurde er erstmals im 1. Wahlkreis der Präfektur Kyōto ins Unterhaus gewählt und seither sieben Mal bestätigt. Von September 1997 bis Juli 1998 war er Arbeitsminister im Kabinett von Ryūtarō Hashimoto. Unter Premierminister Yoshirō Mori war er zwischen 2000 und 2001 Vorsitzender der Nationalen Kommission für öffentliche Sicherheit und Staatsminister für Katastrophenschutz. Von 2006 bis 2007 war Ibuki Bildungsminister im Kabinett von Shinzō Abe. Kurz nach seinem Amtsantritt hatte er sich dagegen ausgesprochen, Englisch als Fremdsprache verpflichtend in die Lehrpläne japanischer Grundschulen aufzunehmen: „Es gibt keinen Grund Englisch zu lernen, solange die Kinder nicht schönes Japanisch sprechen“. Nach Abes Rücktritt wurde er unter dem Parteivorsitzenden Yasuo Fukuda, den seine Faktion bei der Wahl gegen Tarō Asō unterstützt hatte, Generalsekretär der LDP. Bei der Kabinettsumbildung am 1. August 2008 ernannte Fukuda Ibuki zum Finanzminister, Nachfolger als Generalsekretär wurde Tarō Asō. Als dieser einen Monat später zum Parteivorsitzenden und Premierminister gewählt wurde, ersetzte er Ibuki durch Shōichi Nakagawa. Im neuen Kabinett war Ibukis Einfluss gewachsen: die Ibuki-Faktion war dort mit drei Ministern vertreten. Bei der für die LDP verheerenden Unterhauswahl 2009 verlor Ibuki seinen Wahlkreis an den Demokraten Tomoyuki Taira, wurde aber über den Verhältniswahlblock Kinki wiedergewählt. Bei der Unterhauswahl 2012 erhielt Ibuki weniger Stimmen als 2009, konnte seinen Wahlkreis mit weniger als einem Drittel der Stimmen aber in einem zersplitterten Kandidatenfeld zurückgewinnen. Anschließend wurde er zum Präsidenten des Unterhauses gewählt. Den Vorsitz der bisherigen Ibuki-Faktion übernahm Toshihiro Nikai. Ibuki ist, wie Premier Abe und weitere Kabinett- und LDP-Parteimitglieder, Mitglied der als revisionistisch geltenden Nippon Kaigi. Ibukis Ehefrau Yūko ist eine Enkelin von Takahashi Ryūtarō, dem Eigentümer des Baseball-Teams Takahashi Unions, Vorsitzenden des japanischen Fußballverbandes, Ryokufūkai-Oberhausabgeordneten und Ministers für Internationalen Handel und Industrie der Nachkriegszeit.",

Besonders in ländlichen Gebieten drängte er auf Bildung, Abschaffung des Mitgift-Systems und der Kinderheirat, sowie für das Recht auf Wiederheirat für Witwen. Gupta war oberster Schirmherr mehrerer Bildungseinrichtungen in Haryana. Er wurde dreimal in das Parlament des Bundesstaates Haryana gewählt und fungierte einmal als dessen Sprecher. Einige Jahre war er Minister, Vize-Chief-Minister und zweimal Chief Minister von Haryana. 1996 wurde er in die Rajya Sabha gewählt.

During his terms the Chinese attacked India at Bomdilla then called NEFE now known as Arunachal Pradesh. He strongly opposed the division of Assam State into smaller states like Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya and was member in various Committees of India's Central Government.

Robbins was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, son of Capt. B. Robbins, and educated at the Yarmouth Academy. He arrived in Wellington in 1874, and was a storekeeper in Hawera from 1881. In Hawera he organised a local dairy factory and the National Dairy Association. He was on various local boards; Fire Board (3 years), Hospital Board (chairman 1906-09), and the Wanganui Education Board 1897-1906. His first public service was as a member of the school committee in Hawera for a good decade, where he was chairman for most of that time. He was a member of the Hawera Borough Council for fifteen years and Mayor of Hawera for seven years. Robbins stood in the 1893 election in the Egmont electorate and came second of three candidates. He contested the Hawera electorate in the 1896 and 1905 elections. He came a close second in 1896, and came third in 1905. Robbins moved to Tauranga in 1911, and was Mayor of Tauranga twice, from 1912 to 1915 and 1929 to 1933. He retired from the mayoralty in 1915 and did not contest the election, which was won by Charles MacMillan over John Cuthbert Adams. Robbins stood against the incumbent, William Herries of the Reform Party, in the 1919 election in the Tauranga electorate and was beaten with a margin of over 30% of the vote. He initially declared himself an Independent Progressive Liberal but received the endorsement of Joseph Ward and was the official candidate of the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Legislative Council by the First Labour Government. He died in January 1953 aged 96 and is buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery on 18th Avenue in Tauranga.

He was a son of John Caldwell (1779–1857) and Hannah Pickett Robinson (1794–1875). He was born in Morganton, Burke County, North Carolina where he had a home for most of his life. Caldwell attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating on June 4, 1840. He was a member of Dialectic Senate. He was examined by the Supreme Court and admitted to Superior Court Practice (much like passing a bar examination) in June 1841, becoming solicitor for Burke County. In 1842 he was elected a member of the North Carolina House of Commons in which he served two sessions. In 1850 he represented Burke County in the state senate. After the close of the Civil War he was a member of the Reconstruction Convention, and President of Western North Carolina Railroad. Caldwell was elected the first Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 1868, the same year the state constitution had created the office. He became governor in 1871 upon the impeachment and conviction of Governor William Woods Holden. Caldwell was elected governor in his own right in 1872, by about two thousand majority, becoming the second Republican elected governor of North Carolina. His areas of interest were the state debt and the state finances and the opening of the public schools which had been closed in 1863 due to lack of money. He appointed Alexander McIver as Superintendent of Public Instruction and got a bill passed allowing private aid for public schools in order to gain funds to reopen the schools. Caldwell married Minerva Ruffin Cain on December 12, 1840. Tod and Minerva had at least four children: Mary Ruffin Caldwell, wife of Dr. Waighstill Collett; John \"Jack\" Caldwell, killed at Gettysburg; Martha R. Caldwell, wife of Edward W. Ward; and Hannah J. Caldwell, wife of Walter Brem. Shortly after arriving on July 9, 1874 at Hillsborough, Orange County, North Carolina to attend the railroad's stockholders' meeting, Caldwell became very ill and died unexpectedly two days later on July 11, 1874. Newspaper reports stated he died from cholera morbus. His body was returned to the state capital to lie in state after which his body was carried to Morganton and buried in the family plot in Forest Hill Cemetery.",

Following poor opinion polling, Mander initiated a leadership challenge against incumbent LNP leader Lawrence Springborg; he was shortly followed by former Treasurer Tim Nicholls. In the first round, Mander received 10 votes to Nicholls' 14 and Springborg's 17; he was therefore eliminated.

  "text" : "Robert Strange (September 20, 1796 – February 19, 1854) was a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1836 and 1840. Strange was born in Manchester, Virginia. He attended New Oxford Academy and Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. He graduated from Hampden–Sydney College in south central Virginia in 1815 and practiced law in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons (1821–1823 and 1826) and was a judge of the superior court of North Carolina (1827–1836). Strange was elected as a Jacksonian (later Democrat) to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Willie Person Mangum and served from December 5, 1836, to November 16, 1840, when he resigned and resumed the practice of law in Fayetteville, where he died on February 19, 1854 and was buried in the family burial ground at Myrtle Hill, near Fayetteville. Strange was an ardent and active Freemason, serving as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina, Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons from 1812 through 1814. He also served as Master of Phoenix Lodge No. 8, A. F. & A. M., in Fayetteville, NC, for the year 1826. Strange commanded the Fayetteville Independent Light Infantry (FILI), an independent militia company in Fayetteville, NC. In this role Strange served as the escort for the Marquis de Lafayette when he visited Fayetteville on the 5th of March, 1825. A number of people read law with him, including his nephew James Strange French. He was the author of Eoneguski, or the Cherokee Chief, which has been called the first North Carolina novel. The Robert Strange Country House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.",

Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, he emigrated to Canada with his wife in 1891 settling in Nanaimo, British Columbia. A miner by trade, Smith was a moderate trade unionist in Nanaimo. In 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate \"Liberal-Labour\" platform. He ran for Vancouver's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power. Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. Ralph Smith was a supporter of women's suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed.",

He stood down as Premier during his trial, and longtime minister Edward Brooker was sworn in as his replacement on 19 December 1947. The trial was concluded by February the next year, and Cosgrove was acquitted. Brooker stood down and Cosgrove was reinstated, appointing Brooker as Treasurer and Minister for Transport. Cosgrove was chairman of the Tasmanian Tourist Council and of the Southern Tasmanian Trotting Association. He was also a member of the council of the University of Tasmania (1940–46 and 1948–55) and of the local branch of the St Vincent de Paul Society, and president of the Royal Hobart Golf Club.

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Haltemprice and Howden, Davis was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1997 New Year Honours, having previously been Minister of State at the Foreign Office from July 1994 to April 1997. Davis was raised on Aboyne Estate, a council estate in Tooting, South West London. After attending Bec Grammar School in Tooting, London, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with Tate & Lyle. Entering Parliament in 1987 at the age of 38 for the Boothferry constituency, in his subsequent political career he held the positions of Conservative party chairman and Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Shadow Home Secretary in the shadow cabinet, under both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and then second. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary. This was in order to force a by-election in his seat, for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP in June 2008, he officially became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won it in July 2008. In 2010, Davis was invited by Prime Minister David Cameron to join the cabinet of his coalition government, but he declined and stayed on the backbenches. In July 2016, following the UK voting to leave the European Union, Davis was appointed by Theresa May as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.",

He was elected to the Parliament of Queensland for the electorate of Stafford at the 1983 state election. Murphy completed biographies on a number of Queensland ALP figures, notably Thomas J. Ryan and Bill Hayden. He was working on a biography of Andrew Fisher before his death. Murphy was diagnosed with cancer in 1983 and died in 1984, aged 47.

  "text" : "Diana Muriel Warnock AM (née Robinson; born 3 October 1940 in Western Australia) is a former Western Australian radio broadcaster, women's rights activist and state politician. Warnock worked as a journalist with the Perth Daily News, and as a radio broadcaster with 720 ABC Perth, 6PR and 6NR. She was elected to the State Parliament as the Member for Perth in 1993, succeeding Dr Ian Alexander who had retired. She was re-elected in 1996 but did not contest the February 2001 election. Her political career was entirely from the opposition bench, during the premiership of Richard Court. Warnock served as Opposition whip, spokesperson for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and the Arts and spokesperson for Women's Interests and Racing & Gaming. She also served as President of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. In 1996, Warnock and upper house MP Cheryl Davenport steered a controversial pro-choice bill through the parliament—the \"Acts Amendment (Abortion) Bill\", which effectively decriminalised abortion and enabled women to access abortions of pregnancies up to 20 weeks on the basis of informed consent. In 1999 she was named the Australian Humanist of the Year by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies. As of 2013, she is the current patron of the Friends of Perth International Arts Festival. Warnock was married to local novelist, playwright and arts patron Bill Warnock, who died in 2001.",

His most notable duty was as commander of the Snowbirds Air Demonstration Team - 431 Squadron. In 1986, he was made an Officer of the Order of Military Merit. In 1997, he ran for the leadership of the fledgling Saskatchewan Party. He finished 3rd among three candidates. In 1999, in his first run at public office, he narrowly lost election in the Wood River constituency as the Saskatchewan Party candidate. On election night, he tied Liberal candidate Glen McPherson. The returning officer cast the deciding vote in favour of McPherson. This result was later thrown out in court and a by-election was ordered. McPherson did not run and Huyghebaert then won a resounding victory. He was re-elected in 2003. On May 29, 2009, Huyghebaert was appointed to cabinet by Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall in the role of minister of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing.",

She is a notable Copper Inuk. Born on the land near Bernard Harbour in the Canadian Western Arctic, Maksagak was raised in Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik and the Bathurst Inlet area and eventually settled in Cambridge Bay to raise a family of six surviving children with her husband John Sr. Together they were stalwart supporters of the growing indigenous rights movement in the Canadian north. Their home was often a stopping place and site of discussions when young Inuit involved in negotiating the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or participating in Northwest Territories political life passed through the community. Maksagak was appointed as Deputy Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in 1992. In 1995, she was appointed as Commissioner, partially in anticipation of the pending creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999. She was the first woman and first Inuk to hold the office. In April 1999 she transferred with her office to the new Nunavut Territory and continued to provide stability to the new government in transition. She served until April 2000 as the first commissioner of the newly created territory of Nunavut and then as Assistant Commissioner of Nunavut from 2005 until her death in 2009. Helen Maksagak was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada in May, 2003. She served as a member of the Qulliit (Nunavut) Status of Women Council and as an Elder for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. Maksagak died on January 23, 2009 at the age of 77. Helen Maksagak Drive in Iqaluit is named in her memory.",

After working on a farm near Moose Jaw, they were able to purchase land not far from his original homestead. Kemper served on the rural municipal district council for Arlington. He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the Saskatchewan general election, 1934, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932. In 1935, it changed its name and officially became the Saskatchewan section of the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF. During the eighth provincial election on June 19, 1934, the FLG had five elected members come to office, including Kemper. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in Gull Lake in 1938 and in the Maple Creek federal riding in 1940. In 1953, Kemper sold his farm and retired to the town of Shaunavon. He died in a car accident near Tompkins while travelling to a CCF rally.",

He represented the United Labor Party until being expelled in the 1917 Labor split, and thereafter represented the splinter National Party until his defeat at the 1918 election. Chesson was born in Adelaide and was educated at Grote Street Model School and Pulteney Street School. He began working in a boot factory at the age of twelve, and left school at fifteen to become a mason and bricklayer. He worked in Melbourne from 1885 to 1892 before returning to Adelaide. He was president and financial secretary of the South Australian Masons and Bricklayers' Society, and was their delegate to the Trades and Labour Council, of which he was also president and vice-president. Chesson also served on the Adelaide Trades Hall management committee and Eight Hours Committee, and as president and vice-president of the United Labor Party. Chesson was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1905 election in the seat of Port Adelaide, shifting to the new seat of West Torrens following an electoral redistribution in 1915. He was chairman of committees from 1915 to 1918. Chesson left the Labor Party for the new National Party in the 1917 Labor split over conscription. He was defeated by a Labor candidate when he ran for re-election at the 1918 election. After leaving politics, he was clerk of works in the department of the Architect-in-Chief. He died at his home in Croydon in July 1948, aged 85. He had celebrated his diamond wedding anniversary that January.",

Troxler ran for the post of North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture in 2000, losing to Meg Scott Phipps; he ran again for the same position in the 2004 Council of State election, finishing only 2,000 votes ahead of incumbent Democrat Britt Cobb. However, because over 4,000 votes were lost in Carteret County, the race was unresolved for over three months. After extended legal battles between Cobb and Troxler, Cobb conceded the race on February 4, 2005. Troxler was sworn in as North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner on February 8, 2005, a month after the rest of the Council of State, becoming the first Republican Agriculture Commissioner in the state's history. After his inauguration at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, Troxler rode a tractor to his downtown offices. Steve Troxler was elected in 2008 to serve another term as Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the state of North Carolina. In 2012 he was elected to a third term. There has been some controversy regarding his stance on legally carried firearms at the NC State Fair. Opponents like to point out that he promised police escorts for attendees to get to their cars safely, but none were provided.",

The first Commissioner to actually reside in the Northwest Territories, he was a leader in the construction of a semiautonomous, responsible self-government run by residents of the territory. He was appointed as a Citizenship Judge in British Columbia in December 1997 and served until 2005 Hodgson was one of the founders of the Arctic Winter Games - which began in Yellowknife in 1970 for athletes from Alaska, Yukon, and the NWT – and which now also include Greenland, parts of Arctic Russia, as well as Northern Alberta and Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and the new territory Nunavut which was formed from NWT in 1999. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 18, 1970for his service to labour and government. Subsequently he received the Queen's commemorative medals for her silver, golden, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012);as well as the Canada 125 medal in 1992. When rapid changes in socio-economic conditions threatened the continuity of Inuit oral history, Commissioner Hodgson urged the taping of elders' stories. In 1974, the residents of Pangnirtung (since then becoming part of Nunavut) presented the Commissioner with eleven stories which were later compiled into a book. Hodgson was nicknamed \"Umingmak\" by the Inuit. For his services in the NWT, he was presented the public service's Outstanding Achievement Award in 1976. From 1942 to 1945 he served with the Royal Canadian Navy on convoy duty in the North Atlantic for which he received the 1939-1945 Star, Atlantic Star and other World War II medals. From 1979 to 1981 he was Canadian co-chairman of the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission. He was recruited by Premier William R. Bennett of British Columbia to run BC Ferries for a time in the 1980s. He was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the BC Transit in 1985. Hodgson died on December 18, 2015.",

He supported, assisted and nurtured a number of institutions, particularly in Mumbai and enriched the city culturally. He was the Member of Parliament from Bombay when it was part of the unified Bombay State. He was a Union Minister during the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shashtri and Indira Gandhi. Though a three-time MP, he was defeated by George Fernandes in Mumbai South (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1967 for 4th Lok Sabha. He then fought a by-poll from Banaskantha in Gujarat and rejoined Lok Sabha. In 1969 he left Congress of Indira Gandhi with senior leaders like Morarji Desai and Nijalingappa. He contested from Banaskantha Lok Sabha seat in 1971 on Congress (O) ticket but lost to the Congress candidate. In the Lok Sabha discussions on the report of the States Reorganisation Commission, on 15 November 1955, Patil demanded that the Bombay city be constituted as an autonomous city-state, laying great stress on its cosmopolitan character. However, Bombay state was partitioned into the present day states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1960, and the city of Bombay (now called Mumbai) became the capital of Maharashtra.",

  "text" : "(For those of a similar name, see Susan Davis (disambiguation).) Susan Margaret Davies (born 14 March 1954) is a former Australian politician. She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966–70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from Latrobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; it and its predecessors had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent, emerging victorious. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Kennett-government swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \"Independents' Charter\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing Steve Bracks and the Labor Party as the new minority government. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but lost to the Liberal candidate, former MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co-operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil.",

He played an important role in the referendum for statehood for the Northern Territory in 1998. He had served for many years on a bipartisan committee of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which had recommended a constitution and an elected Constitutional Assembly to give it further consideration. The then Chief Minister, Shane Stone put forward a different constitution to a non-elected Constitutional Assembly. Steve Hatton was prominent in opposing this kind of statehood. The referendum failed, and he was reported as saying \"One of the campaign slogans at the time was: 'we want statehood, not Stonehood'\".",

Born in South Melbourne to Tom Corrigan and Emily Olive Angleton, he was educated at Christian Brothers' College (Albert Park) and completed his apprenticeship as an Electrical Contractor with his brother Thomas Corrigan Jnr. On 17 March 1945 he married Matilda Semmens, with whom he had two children. He worked for his brother's business before becoming treasurer of the Melbourne branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and secretary of the Port Melbourne branch of the Australian Labor Party, as well as campaign secretary to Jack Holloway and Frank Crean. In 1952 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in a by-election for the seat of Port Melbourne, replacing his father who had died in January. In 1955 he joined the breakaway Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) and was defeated at that year's state election. He then ran against his former boss, Holloway, in the federal election held later that year and lost. Corrigan died at Fitzroy in 1964.",

She was, at the time, the sole female Republican in California's congressional delegation, and until Congresswoman Mimi Walters was elected in November 2014, no other female Republican was part of the delegation. On March 19, 2013, Bono announced she was joining Washington, D.C.-based federal affairs firm FaegreBD Consulting as senior vice president. Now a principal, she focuses her government advocacy and consulting practice there on legislative, regulatory and policy matters related to the entertainment, media and information technology sectors.

Originally a Democrat, he evolved into a Republican during the Civil War, and helped perpetuate the Wisconsin party's political machinery. His sustained support for President Ulysses S. Grant's administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J.

  "text" : "Mavroudis „Makis“ Voridis (griechisch Μαυρουδής “Μάκης” Βορίδης, * 1964 in Athen) ist ein griechischer Rechtsanwalt und Politiker. Der ehemalige Anführer, Vorsitzende und Gründungsmitglied mehrerer rechtsextremer Gruppen und Parteien war Verkehrsminister der Übergangsregierung Papadimos für die rechtspopulistische LA.O.S. Nach seinem Wechsel zur konservativen Nea Dimokratia 2012 übernahm Voridis deren Fraktionsvorsitz im griechischen Parlament, zuletzt war er Gesundheitsminister im Kabinett Samaras. Makis Voridis hat ein Studium an der Universität London mit dem Titel Magister der Rechte abgeschlossen. Als Jugendlicher war er in der faschistischen Studentengruppe Eleftheri Mathites (Ελεύθεροι Μαθητές ‚Freie Schüler‘) am Athens College aktiv. Voridis übernahm 1985 von Nikolaos Michaloliakos die Jugendführung der nationalistischen EPEN, die sich für die Freilassung der Junta-Offiziere und die Rückkehr des Königs einsetzte. Nach Voridis’ Ansicht standen diese Parteiziele einer Modernisierung entgegen, deshalb gründete er 1994 die rechtsgerichtete Elliniko Metopo nach dem Vorbild seines Freundes Jean-Marie Le Pen und war deren Vorsitzender. Zwei Mal - 1998 und 2002 - war Voridis Kandidat für das Amt des Athener Oberbürgermeisters. Die Elliniko Metopo verfügte über enge Verbindungen zur französischen Front National. Voridis, unterhielt persönliche Kontakte zu Le Pen und Carl Lang. Die gesamte Parteiführung wechselte im Herbst 2005 zur LA.O.S-Partei. Nach der Parlamentswahl 2007 war Voridis bis 2009 Abgeordneter für die erstmals im griechischen Parlament vertretene LA.O.S-Partei. In der Übergangsregierung Papadimos war er vom 11. November 2011 bis 17. Mai 2012 Minister für Infrastruktur, Verkehr und Netzwerke. Nach dem Ausscheiden der LA.O.S aus der Regierung im Februar 2012 trat er zur Nea Dimokratia über. Seit der Parlamentswahl im Mai 2012 war Voridis Abgeordneter der Nea Dimokratia und übernahm nach der Parlamentswahl im Juni 2012 den Fraktionsvorsitz. Vom 10. Juni 2014 bis 26. Januar 2015 war Voridis Gesundheitsminister im Kabinett Samaras.",

He was brought up in County Clare, Ireland, and, finding no employment, he \"drifted to London\" in 1948, aged 15, and worked as a railwayman until he entered politics. He was elected Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North in a by-election in 1969 following the death of sitting MP Gerry Reynolds. He had previously been the secretary of the Constituency Labour Party. His selection over Keith Kyle was the subject of an investigation in the early 1970s by The Sunday Times newspaper. They highlighted his background with a local building company and the local Irish community and questioned the propriety of the tactics of his supporters during his selection as candidate. Regarding Northern Ireland he was staunchly pro-Nationalist and anti-Partition. In his 14 years in parliament, O'Halloran only contributed twice to parliamentary debates. O'Halloran was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. However, in 1983, the SDP chose John Grant, the MP for Islington Central (which was being abolished in boundary changes), to be its candidate in Islington North. O'Halloran left the SDP to stand as an independent Labour candidate in the 1983 general election. The official Labour candidate Jeremy Corbyn won while O'Halloran came in fourth with 11% of the vote. Grant came third with 22% of the vote. He retired to County Wexford with his wife, and lived there until his death at age 66.",

While in the State Assembly, he and fellow Republican representative and future governor Scott Walker were involved in the \"Wisconsin witch hunt\" in 2001–02, in which they attempted to terminate the employment of state employee Jamyl Witch because of her beliefs as a Wiccan. Walker claimed that Witch's hiring as a prison chaplain raised \"both personal and political concerns\" because she \"practice[d] a religion that actually offends people of many other faiths\". Huebsch likewise said that \"Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to accept this hocus-pocus,\" proposing to delete the state appropriation which funded Witch's position, although in the past he had repeatedly advocated increasing state funding for prison chaplains. Walker and Huebsch were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating Witch's employment. Huebsch resigned from the Assembly after Walker, now Governor-elect, appointed Huebsch as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration on December 30, 2010. In a special election on May 3, 2011, the District 94 Assembly seat he had held for eight terms went to Democrat Steve Doyle. In early 2015 Huebsch was moved to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. His position as Secretary of Administration is now held by Scott Neitzel.

At this time, Strauss became more identified with the regional politics of Bavaria. While he ran for the chancellorship as the candidate of the CDU/CSU in 1980, for the rest of his life Strauss never again held federal office. From 1978 until his death in 1988, he was the head of the Bavarian government. His last two decades were also marked by a fierce rivalry with CDU chairman Helmut Kohl.",

  "text" : "Frank Arthur Cooper (16 July 1872 – 30 November 1949) was Premier of Queensland from 1942 to 1946 for the Australian Labor Party. He was born on 16 July 1872 at Blayney, New South Wales, the son of an English miller and his Irish wife who had immigrated to Australia. Frank was educated in Sydney and worked as a clerk in various capacities around Sydney, including the Sydney diocese of the Anglican church and the Westinghouse brake company. In the latter capacity he moved to postings around the country before settling in Ipswich, Queensland where the main railway workshops for the State of Queensland were located. Cooper joined the Brisbane Clerical Union and became involved in Labor politics in Ipswich, including as president and secretary of the Ipswich Workers' Political Union, and was involved in the eight-hour day movement in provincial Queensland. His political activities, particularly his support for workers strikes in the state in 1912, caused him to run afoul of employer and he was dismissed, and Cooper subsequently became a journalist and activist within the Labor movement. He became editor of the Queensland Leader, a workers publication in Ipswich, in 1915 and remained so until 1925. In 1915 he was tapped to run for the seat of Bremer in the Queensland Parliament, a seat based in Ipswich which he would hold for the next three decades. In 1924 he became an alderman and eventually deputy-mayor for Ipswich City Council. In 1925 he married Agnes Hardy. Cooper had joined the first majority ALP government in Queensland under T. J. Ryan shortly after his election and became a prominent and well regarded member of the administration. Labor went back to opposition in 1929 but Cooper soon distinguished himself as an effective debater and parliamentarian. His reputation was such that he became Assistant Treasurer and Secretary for Public Instruction upon the election of William Forgan Smith as premier of a new ALP government in 1932. By 1938 Cooper was sitting on the Queensland ALP's central executive and was treasurer. He excelled in the position: that year he delivered the state's first budget surplus since 1927. He became deputy leader of the parliamentary party in September 1940, and played a key role in preparing Queensland's resources and mobilization for the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific. In 1942, the Federal ALP government under John Curtin introduced uniform taxation which ended the system of dual income taxes levied by both the states and the Commonwealth, instead making the Commonwealth the sole collector of income taxes with grants to be given back to the states to compensate for any losses. Many states, including Queensland, challenged the law in the High Court but were ultimately unsuccessful. Although William Forgan Smith accepted the decision he resigned soon after, and Cooper was duly elected to replace him as Premier of Queensland. Although now in his 70s, Cooper was an ardent supporter of the Commonwealth's prosecution of the war effort and worked with Curtin closely, sometimes invoking the ire of his own party in Queensland. Cooper continued in the premier role throughout the war, however at the war's end he stood down in favour of his Treasurer Ned Hanlon. In retirement he was active in the Anglican synod and on the senate of the University of Queensland, and died at his home in 1949. Cooper was accorded a State funeral which took place from St John's Cathedral to the Mount Thompson crematorium.",

Her support for the Relationships Bill 2005, a bill which extends legal protections to same-sex couples, has made her a target of fundamentalist groups. Her opinions are considered by some as being incompatible with the opinions of her 'bible belt' electorate. Despite this, she was returned at the 2006 state election with a swing of more than 10 points (two-party-preferred), exceeding the statewide swing to the Labor government and defeating her Liberal opponent Pat Trainor, a former pastor in the Assemblies of God.

  "text" : "Francis James Roscoe (1831 – December 20, 1878) was a Canadian entrepreneur and Member of Parliament. Francis Roscoe was born in Liverpool, England, the son of W.S. Roscoe, was educated at University College and the University of London and came to British Columbia in 1862, settling in the Ross Bay area of Victoria, British Columbia. He was the younger brother of poet William Caldwell Roscoe and the grandson of English historian and writer William Roscoe. In 1864, he married Anna Letitia Le Breton. Roscoe was a partner in several hardware and ironware ventures. In 1870, he became the Commissioner of Savings Banks for the British Columbia colony. Roscoe stood for election as an Independent Liberal candidate in the Canadian federal election in 1874 in the two-member Victoria riding. He placed second in a close three-way race and was elected along with Liberal incumbent Amor De Cosmos. Roscoe did not stand for re-election in 1878 and died later in the year in Victoria at the age of 47. He was replaced in the seat by incoming Prime Minister John A. Macdonald who had lost his Ontario seat earlier as the BC portion of the election was delayed, and because he was deemed unelectable in eastern Canada due to ongoing politics surrounding his role in the Pacific Scandal. Roscoe's Victoria home is today preserved by The Land Conservancy of BC as a rare example of a pre-Confederation colonial house.",

King was born in Saint John, New Brunswick and attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he received a B.A. in 1859 and a M.A. in 1862. He then served under articles to a senior lawyer in Saint John, Robert Leonard Hazen, was made an attorney in 1863, and was called to the bar in 1865. King was elected to the first provincial legislature of the new Canadian Confederation in 1867 and served in the Confederation Party government as minister without portfolio. When Andrew R. Wetmore resigned, the Confederation Party became the Liberal-Conservatives and King became Premier in 1870. Some members of his caucus felt he was too close to the federal Conservatives of Sir John A. Macdonald and King was maneuvered out of the leadership by George L. Hathaway with King taking a position in the new cabinet. When Hathaway died in 1872, King became Premier for a second time serving until 1878. One of King's major accomplishments was the Common Schools Act of 1871 which implemented a single, tax supported public school system. As Attorney General, King appeared in the courts to defend the Act from constitutional challenges, including appearing before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada within the British Empire, in the case of Maher v. Town Council of Portland, which upheld the Act. In 1880 he became a justice on the province's supreme court, the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick, and in 1893 he became a justice on the Supreme Court of Canada. On his death in 1901, he was interred in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick.",

  "text" : "George Henry Williams (March 26, 1823 – April 4, 1910) was an American judge and politician. He served as Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon's U.S. Senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the Virginius, a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C. Gibbs United States District Attorney at Portland, Oregon. In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General under the controversy of his wife allegedly taking payment money from the custom house firm Pratt & Boyd in order to drop litigation by the U.S. Justice Department. After his resignation, Williams took part in counting Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes in settling the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland's mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams advocated women's suffrage and that marriage and divorce proceedings needed to be handled by the civil courts rather than the church. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted while Mayor of Portland for not enforcing gambling restriction statutes; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor. On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Williams was the second to last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration.",

Adams was born at a time when all the original mutineers apart from his own father had been killed, or in the case of Ned Young died of natural causes. In 1808 the Pitcairn colony was discovered and the elder Adams was granted amnesty for his part in the mutiny. Both of Adams' parents died in March 1829, when George was 24 years old. Adams served as Chief Magistrate on Pitcairn in 1848. Adams was an opponent of Joshua Hill, and he opposed the decision to move to Norfolk Island, due to his granddaughter being ill. Adams did eventually move, and died on Norfolk Island in 1873.",

He was born on 7 February 1853 at Beadnell, Northumberland, England and after training to become a blacksmith moved to Queensland in 1877. He became a mining speculator on the Croydon goldfields and then set up his own forge in Tambo, Queensland to service mining operations in the local region. He became involved in local politics for the Australian Labor Party, and in 1893 he was elected to represent the electoral district of Barcoo in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and served in that post until 1909. He rose to senior positions within the party, culminating in his election as leader of the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party in 1904 after the death of his predecessor William Henry Brown. Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.",

He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, working on issues of international economic development, Africa and public-private partnerships, and chairman of the US-Taiwan Business Council. He is considered to be a leading neoconservative. However, Wolfowitz rejects the term and prefers to call himself a \"Scoop Jackson Republican,\" after Democratic U.S. senator Henry M. Jackson who was known for his hawkish views on foreign policy. After serving two years, he resigned as president of the World Bank Group due to scandals described by a Reuters report as \"a protracted battle over his stewardship, prompted by his involvement in a high-paying promotion for his companion\". He was reportedly the model for a minor character named Philip Gorman in Saul Bellow's 2001 book Ravelstein.",

A member of the Australian Labor Party, he was elected as the member for Gaven in the 2006 state election, defeating National Party member Alex Douglas, who had won the seat against Gray in a by-election earlier that year. In late 2008, Gray earned himself some bad publicity when he was accused of two separate instances of \"bullying\", both of them against elderly women. In the first instance he threaten to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray was forced to publicly apologise for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time. On this occasion, Douglas, running under the banner of the newly formed Liberal National Party, narrowly emerged as the victor. Following his defeat, Gray angrily slammed what he perceived as negative and \"biased\" coverage of him by the Gold Coast Bulletin.",

His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands. On May 25, 1870 he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court.",

He entered politics as one of the six MHAs for Bass in April 1909, and almost immediately became attorney-general and minister for education in the Elliott Lewis second and third ministries, taking the additional position of minister of mines in October 1909. When Lewis retired in June 1912 Solomon became premier, attorney-general and minister of education, but he had a bare majority of one and it required much tact and finesse to keep the ministry going until April 1914. Attention was given to education and considerable additions were made to the number of state and high schools. Never a robust man, Solomon felt the strain of office – his health broke down, and he died at Hobart aged 38 on 5 October 1914. He was survived by his wife and two sons. He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church and a temperance reformer.",

Currently an independent, she has previously served as a minister for both the Australian Labor Party and Country Liberal Party and been territory leader of the Palmer United Party. Anderson entered the Northern Territory Assembly as a star candidate for the Australian Labor Party at the 2005 election. She was re-elected unopposed as the Member for MacDonnell in the August 2008 Territory election and with the subsequent return of the Henderson Labor Government was appointed to Cabinet. She held the positions of Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage; Minister for Parks and Wildlife; Minister for Arts and Museums; and Minister for Indigenous Policy. She left the Cabinet and the Labor Party in 2009 after a dispute over indigenous housing, and sat as an independent for two years. She then joined the opposition Country Liberal Party in 2011 and was elected as a Country Liberal candidate at the 2012 election. She resigned from the CLP in 2014, along with two other indigenous MPs, briefly becoming an independent once again. However, on 27 April 2014 it was announced that the three MLAs had joined the Palmer United Party, with Anderson serving as parliamentary leader. She resigned from Palmer United to sit as an independent on 29 November 2014. It was briefly rumoured that she was returning to the CLP amid the 2015 CLP leadership spill, but she remained an independent. Anderson speaks six indigenous languages: Anmatyerre, Luritja, Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Western Arrernte and Yankunytjatjara. She is also an accomplished artist. She is among Australia's most senior indigenous politicians, and has been a prominent indigenous activist, including as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Central Zone Commissioner (see: List of Indigenous Australian politicians).

  "text" : "Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee (1901–1986) (Bengali: অজয় মুখোপাধ্যায়) was the fourth chief minister of West Bengal, India. He hailed from Tamluk, Purba Medinipur district, West Bengal. Born in 1901, he was one of the leaders of Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar (Tamrlipta National Government), which came into effect on 17 December 1942 during the Quit India Movement, a programme of civil disobedience launched in India in 1942. He was greatly influenced by Swami Vivekananda. Earlier a member of the Indian National Congress, he later became a leader in the Bangla Congress, which co-governed with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in two United Front governments in the 1960s and 1970s. He held the chief ministerial position in both these governments, from March to November 1967, and again from February 1969 to March 1970.In the year 1967 Ajoy Mukherjee defeated Prafulla Chandra Sen another Gandhian at Arambagh assembly constituency and became chief minister of West Bengal after Prafulla Chandra Sen. Architect of Ajoy Mukherjee's victory at Arambagh was Narayan Ch Ghosh the then students leader at arambagh. Narayan Ghosh accompanied Ajoy Mukherjee in a boat for several days to see sever flood effected areas in Arambagh & Ghatal subdivision during 1968. People of flood affected areas were enthused by Ajoy Mukherjee for his untired move to stand for them. Ajoy Mukherjee with some of his closed colleagues, viz. Pranob Mukherjee etc., joined Indian National Congress leaving Sushil Dhara- his long term associates. He was offered ministerial post at Centre by Indira Gandhi, but Ajoy Mukherjee saying his age and health condition had pushed Pranab Mukherjee. Pranab Mukherjee became State Minister in the Indian Cabinet. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award in 1977 from Government of India. His brother Biswanath Mukherjee was the husband of Geeta Mukherjee, a communist MP. Ajoy's niece Kalyani (daughter of another brother) was married to Mohan Kumaramangalam and was the mother of Rangarajan Kumaramangalam and Lalitha Kumaramangalam. Mukherjee died on May 27, 1986 in Calcutta.",
