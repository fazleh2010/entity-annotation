In 1993, he defeated the incumbent provincial government and became premier. Savage was a controversial premier, bringing in many reforms in taxation, regional government, and government hiring practices. He resigned as premier in 1997 due to his low approval ratings in public polls. He died of cancer at the age of 70 in 2003. He was the father of Mike Savage, current mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality.",

Seit 1977 ist er ohne Unterbrechung Senator für sein Département und bekleidete auch mehrfach Regierungsposten. Von Mai 1974 bis August 1976 war er Minister für Wirtschaft und Finanzen unter Premierminister Jacques Chirac. Danach bekam Fourcade in der ersten Regierung von Raymond Barre ab August 1976 den Posten des Ministers für Verkehr und Infrastruktur. In Barres zweitem Kabinett war für ein halbes Jahr zusätzlich für den Bereich Raumordnung verantwortlich. Im September 1977 verlor er dann allerdings seinen Ministerposten und wurde durch Fernand Icart ersetzt. Daneben bekleidet er zahlreiche andere Ämter und Funktionen.",

  "text" : "Sir Alfred Hopkinson (28 June 1851 – 11 November 1939) was an English lawyer, academic and politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for two three-year periods, separated by nearly thirty years. He was the son of John Hopkinson, a mechanical engineer, and among his brothers were John Hopkinson, a physicist and electrical engineer, and Edward Hopkinson, an electrical engineer and MP. He first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1885 general election, when he was the unsuccessful Liberal Party candidate in Manchester East. He was unsuccessful again as a Liberal Unionist candidate at the 1892 general election, when he stood in Manchester South-West. Hopkinson finally won a seat at the 1895 general election, when he was elected as MP for Cricklade in Wiltshire. He resigned from Parliament in February 1898, by the procedural device of accepting appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. Hopkinson was Vice-Chancellor of the Victoria University from 1901 to 15 July 1903 and then of the Victoria University of Manchester until 1913. In December 1914 he was appointed to the Committee on Alleged German Outrages, which in May 1915 reported on German war crimes against civilians during the invasion of Belgium in the opening months of World War I. He received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. He returned to Parliament in March 1926, when he won a by-election for the Combined English Universities. He did not contest the 1929 general election. A sculpture of him by John Cassidy was exhibited at Manchester in 1912. His son Austin Hopkinson also became a Member of Parliament. One of his daughters married Sir Gerald Hurst M.P.",
