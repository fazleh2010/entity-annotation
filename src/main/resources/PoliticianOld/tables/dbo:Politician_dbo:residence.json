He practised with Blake, Cassels & Graydon before starting his own firm in 1968. After several years of practice at Houser Henry Loudon and Syron, Jaffary joined Gowlings in 1992 before continuing his municipal planning law practice as a sole practitioner near the turn of the century. Jaffary was active with the federal New Democratic Party and served as vice-president from 1969 to 1973. Jaffary became active in local politics in 1968 when he became president of the Ward 2 Residents' Association in the Cabbagetown area. The association fought the city's plans to tear down housing for urban renewal. In the 1960s, Cabbagetown was a run down area of town. Since then many of the houses have been renovated and the neighbourhood is now gentrified and upscale. Jaffary ran for Toronto City Council and became alderman for Ward 7 in 1969. As senior alderman, he sat on both the city and Metro Toronto councils. He was re-elected in 1972 but decided not to run in the 1974 election. During his tenure, he was active in the reform wing of city council along with John Sewell. He was interested in civic organization and administration and became involved in city housing policy.",

Following his retirement from Royal Insurance, he became a private insurance consultant for a number of years. In the 1999 election, he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster as a Progressive Conservative and shortly afterwards became the New Brunswick Minister of Labour. In 2000, he became minister for the new Department of Training and Employment Development, a portfolio which encompassed much of his old labour portfolio as well as some social welfare programs and community colleges. McFarlane was defeated in the 2003 election and left the cabinet as a result. McFarlane lost his seat to Liberal Abel LeBlanc. McFarlane promptly returned to politics in 2004 when he was elected mayor of Saint John by defeating incumbent Shirley McAlary by a margin of over 25%. Ironically, one of McAlary's key backers was Abel LeBlanc. Mayor McFarlane faced severe and lasting criticism and allegations of corruption and incompetence for his role in granting Irving Oil tax concessions in 2005, concessions that have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.",

  "text" : "Norman \"Norm\" Kelly (born August 11, 1941) is a Canadian politician. He is a city councillor in Toronto, Ontario, representing one of two municipal wards that make up the jurisdiction of Scarborough—Agincourt. He was also the deputy mayor of Toronto, succeeding Doug Holyday in 2013 after the latter resigned from Council to contest a by-election for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Following the controversy surrounding Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's admitted substance abuse and further allegations of inappropriate conduct, the Toronto City Council voted on November 15, 2013 and November 18, 2013 to remove the non-statutory mayoral powers from Ford and grant them to Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. On May 1, 2014, Kelly took over the remainder of Ford's duties when Ford entered drug rehabilitation and started a leave of absence from Toronto City Council. These powers were returned when Ford returned to his job on July 1. Even though Kelly had all the powers of the mayoral office for 3 months, Ford still technically held the title of Mayor, while Kelly was still referred to as the Deputy Mayor.",

  "text" : "Edward Miner „Ned“ Lamont, Jr. (* 3. Januar 1954 in Washington, D.C.) ist ein US-amerikanischer Politiker der Demokratischen Partei aus dem Bundesstaat Connecticut. Er war der Kandidat für einen Senatssitz von Connecticut bei den Senatswahlen vom 7. November 2006. In den parteiinternen Vorwahlen, die die Kandidatur festlegen, besiegte er den Amtsinhaber Joe Lieberman. Lamont ist Erbe eines Millionenvermögens und Angehöriger exklusiver Country Clubs, was zu Heucheleivorwürfen im Wahlkampf führte. Jedoch verfehlte er den Einzug in den Senat. Er unterlag Lieberman, der als unabhängiger Kandidat 50 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen errang und damit den Wiedereinzug in den Senat schaffte. Lamont kam nur auf 40 Prozent der Stimmen. Viele Anhänger der Republikanischen Partei gaben Lieberman ihre Stimme und versagten dem republikanischen Kandidaten Alan Schlesinger die Gefolgschaft. Lieberman wurden allgemein größere Chancen als Schlesinger eingeräumt, Lamont zu schlagen. Außerdem gilt Lieberman als wertkonservativ und war so für viele Anhänger der Republikaner wählbar. Im November 2009 kündigte Lamont an, dass er eventuell für die Gouverneurswahlen 2010 in Connecticut kandidieren wolle; im Februar 2010 reichte er seine Kandidatur offiziell bei der Demokratischen Partei ein. Auf einem Parteitag im Mai 2010 unterlag er seinem internen Herausforderer Dan Malloy deutlich. Da Lamont aber die interne Hürde von 15 Prozent der Parteitagsstimmen klar schaffte, konnte er an den Vorwahlen der Demokraten vom 10. August 2010 dennoch teilnehmen, wo er aber ebenfalls klar gegen seinen Konkurrenten Malloy verlor.",

Yamamoto's party formed a majority government in the 39th Parliament and Premier Gordon Campbell included her in his cabinet, between June 2009 and October 2010, as Minister of State for Intergovernmental Relations, and then as Minister of State for Building Code Renewal between October 2010 and March 2011. Following the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election, in which Yamamoto endorsed George Abbott, the new Premier, Christy Clark, promoted Yamamoto to Minister of Advanced Education. Yamamoto has introduced one piece of legislation, the Advanced Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2011, which sought to implement several measures, including expanding the Personal Education Number system which tracks students in the BC educational system to also include private educational institutions, specifying that board members of colleges and universities are to act in the best interests of the institution, and updating the Architectural Institute of BC's dispute resolution process. The bill was introduced on November 3, 2011, but was not adopted before the winter break. Prior to her election to the legislature, Yamamoto owned and operated a business that started as a specialty shop for laser printing but evolved to focus on design and had created props for the television and film industry. She spent time on the governing boards of Capilano College, the North Shore Credit Union, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, and the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation. She completed one term as president of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and worked as the president and general manager of the North Vancouver Chamber of Commerce from 2007 until she was elected as MLA.",

  "text" : "Joy K. MacPhail (born March 6, 1952) is a former Canadian politician in British Columbia. A longtime member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party, she served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1991 to 2005 and as a Minister of the Crown from 1993–1999, and 2000-2001. MacPhail was born in Hamilton, Ontario, but has lived in Vancouver for almost three decades. She studied economics at the University of Western Ontario, and later earned a degree in labour studies at the London School of Economics. She has one son. MacPhail was first elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1991 as the MLA for Vancouver-Hastings, and served in the cabinets of three NDP premiers. Under Premier Mike Harcourt, she served as Minister of Social Services from 1993 to 1996. Under Premier Glen Clark she served a short stint as Minister of Social Services, then as Minister of Health from 1996 to 1998. MacPhail's final cabinet position in the Clark government was as Minister of Finance from 1998 to 1999, when she quit the Clark government at a time when it was suffering from increasing dissent and scandal. When Clark eventually quit the NDP leadership, MacPhail ran for NDP leader, but did not attract significant legislative caucus support. She withdrew when it became obvious that Ujjal Dosanjh had an insurmountable lead. Under Dosanjh, she was the Deputy Premier and served as Minister of Labour and later, Minister of Education. The NDP suffered a massive electoral blow in the May 16, 2001 provincial election, winning only two seats—those of MacPhail and Environment Minister Jenny Kwan. MacPhail only held onto her seat by 409 votes. Exactly one month after the election, MacPhail was appointed as the party's interim leader. She was a harsh critic of the new BC Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell. Although the NDP was the only other party in the legislature, it was four seats short of official party status. Despite this, Assembly Speaker Claude Richmond ensured that the NDP was resourced as an opposition and she was recognized by the Speaker as the Leader of the Opposition. MacPhail stepped down as leader in 2003 and was succeeded by Carole James. She remained as parliamentary leader of the NDP until her retirement from politics after the 2005 election. Following her departure from politics, MacPhail married film and television producer James Shavick, and is currently a partner in his production firm Shavick Entertainment. She is a member of the board of OutTV, a Canadian cable television station owned by Shavick Entertainment, and focused on the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. She has also appeared as a member of political panels on As It Happens on CBC Radio.",

Ostashek declined to use the title Premier adopted by his predecessor, Tony Penikett and preferred to be called Government Leader. Ostashek's minority government, which was kept in power with the support of right leaning independent MLAs, was a conservative one which instituted welfare reform and a reduction of public services. Soon after coming into power, his government signed land claims agreements with four First Nations communities in the Yukon which had been negotiated by the previous government. Ostashek's Yukon Party lost the 1996 election to the Yukon NDP though he retained his seat and became leader of the opposition. In the 2000 election however his Yukon Party was again defeated, this time by the Liberals with Ostashek losing his own seat. He subsequently resigned as Yukon Party leader and retired from politics.

Currently a government affairs counselor for K & L Gates in Washington, DC, Walsh retired from the United States House of Representatives in 2009 after serving for twenty years. Walsh represented a portion of Central New York, that is now known as the state's 24th Congressional District. While in Congress, Walsh was a member of the United States House Committee on Appropriations for 16 years, also chairing several of its subcommittees. As chair of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, alone, Walsh had spending oversight of more than $100 billion during the 109th Congress. In his capacities as chair and member of committees, subcommittees, and caucuses in Congress, Walsh secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds for veterans affairs, healthcare, technology, the environment, higher educational institutions, and many other areas. Walsh was further active in the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which the Walsh Visa was created and named in his honor. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus, Walsh secured passage of laws aimed at guaranteeing universal hearing screenings for newborns and infants in the United States. In 2009, an act that he proposed and which was enacted that achieved this effort was renamed for him in his honor, becoming known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Walsh's change of perspective regarding both of then-President George W. Bush's troop surge of 2007 and ideology regarding the Iraq War, caused Walsh's views to gain headlines in the news media, as well as for additionally desiring a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. For one decade during the 1970s and 1980s, Walsh was active on the Syracuse City Council, serving as its leader for five years. In 1999, he issued a challenge with several goals that is known as The Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative (SNI) for revitalization of the city. The many phases of SNI have been successful in improving neighborhoods and housing in numerous areas of the city. Generally known as a moderate, pro-labor Republican, Walsh currently lives in Washington, DC with his wife, Dede. Walsh's father, William F. Walsh, served as Mayor of Syracuse during the 1960s, as well as a Republican Congress Member of the House of Representatives in the 1970s.",

Rumsey arrived in Chicago on July 28, 1835 to work in a shipping company owned by his uncles.He and his brother subsequently became partners. This firm, then known as Newberry and Dole, sent out the first shipment of grain from Chicago in September 1839. In 1852 Dole retired, and the firm, which was for a time known as Rumsey Brothers, devoted itself exclusively to the grain commission business. Rumsey was identified with the history of Chicago for more than half a century. During that period he was mayor, county treasurer, and president of the Chicago Board of Trade. He was a charter member of the Board of Trade, and through his efforts the present system of grain inspection and grading was adopted. This achievement gave him the title of the “Father of Grain Inspection.” Mr. Rumsey always took an interest in national and state politics. In 1861, during the period that preceded the Civil War, he did much, as mayor, to arouse the enthusiasm of his fellow citizens in favor of the preservation of the Union, and at the mass meeting in Metropolitan Hall a few days after the firing on Fort Sumter, he delivered a stirring address. He was a member of the first war finance committee, and of the Republican state committee the same year. During the Panic of 1873 he was president of the Corn Exchange National Bank. He is buried in Graceland Cemetery.",

  "text" : "John Warfield Johnston (September 9, 1818 – February 27, 1889) was an American lawyer and politician from Abingdon, Virginia. He served in the Virginia State Senate, and represented Virginia in the United States Senate when the state was readmitted after the American Civil War. He was United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a Democrat. Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the Freedmen's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate. Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He was caught in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.",

As mayor, Whitaker was known for supporting spending on quality of life services such as parks and recreation, as well as spearheading a campaign to prevent a drastic reduction in the operations of Eielson Air Force Base due to federal budget cuts. Whitaker endorsed Democrat Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election and spoke during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Many member of the state GOP expressed ill feelings about the decision, with one former state senator accusing him of being a Republican In Name Only. Whitaker's endorsement of Obama was notable as the mayor of the second-largest metropolitan area in Alaska, the home state of 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who was nominated by John McCain after the Democratic convention. In 2009, Whitaker endorsed Democrat Luke Hopkins to be his successor as mayor. Hopkins won the election in a runoff on November 3 and succeeded Whitaker on November 16, 2009.

In zijn woonplaats Heerlen vergaarde hij grote bekendheid met het Actiecomité Ereschuld Mijnwerkers. De SP-afdeling in die plaats werd een van de grootste van Nederland. Van 1982 tot 1996 was De Wit gemeenteraadslid in Heerlen. Van 1995 tot 1998 zat hij in de Eerste Kamer. In 1998 werd hij lid van de Tweede Kamer, waar hij zich vooral bezighield met Justitie, Binnenlandse Zaken en Asielbeleid. Hij zat namens de SP in de parlementaire enquêtecommissie Bouwnijverheid (2002-2003). Hij hield zijn maidenspeech op 17 juni 1998 over het wetsvoorstel Wijziging van de artikelen 140 en 443 van het Wetboek van Strafrecht (Kamerstukken 25638). Hij was voorzitter van de vaste Kamercommissie voor Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid. Zijn vrouw, Riet de Wit was wethouder in Heerlen en regiovoorzitter van de SP in Zuid-Limburg. Bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2006 stond De Wit vierde op de kandidatenlijst van de SP. Hij haalde 9163 stemmen. Op 24 juni 2009 werd Jan de Wit voorzitter van de Tijdelijke commissie onderzoek financieel stelsel, die de oorzaken van de kredietcrisis ging onderzoeken. Deze, vanwege zijn voorzitterschap ook wel de commissie-De Wit genoemde, Tweede Kamercommissie begon op 18 januari 2010 met de openbare verhoren. Op 10 mei 2010 presenteerde De Wit het eerste rapport van de commissie. Dit ging in op de oorzaken van de crisis. Het tweede deel van het onderzoek, dat later dat jaar plaatsvond, ging over het handelen van kabinet en Tweede Kamer. Op 7 november 2011 begon de enquêtecommissie Parlementaire enquête naar het Financieel Stelsel, waar Jan de Wit voorzitter van was, met de openbare verhoren van diverse hoofdrolspelers ten tijde van de kredietcrisis. Op zijn initiatief werd het verbod op godslastering geschrapt. Op 1 april 2014 verliet De Wit de Tweede Kamer en ging met pensioen.",

A school teacher, guidance councillor, principal, and later involved in adult education, correctional education and vocational training as a director at Lakeland College. He was elected in the 1988 federal election at the Beaver River electoral district for the Progressive Conservative party; however, he was terminally stricken with pancreatic cancer and never saw the first day of the 34th Canadian Parliament. Dahmer had entered Edmonton's Royal Alexandra Hospital on October 28, 1988, after suffering symptoms similar to adult onset type two diabetes, but the extent of his condition was not widely known until after election night. However, by the time cancer was discovered it was after the deadline to withdraw from the general election, and at that point it was not certain the cancer could not be successfully treated with chemotherapy. Dahmer died five days after the election, before the Deputy Clerk of the House of Commons could arrive to conduct a swearing-in ceremony. Despite this, parliamentary policy allowed Dahmer's widow to receive a $29,150 severance, which was equivalent to six months salary in office. This money was used to establish the John Dahmer Community Involvement Scholarship at Lakeland College. As of 2016, he continues to hold the record for the shortest term as a federal Member of Parliament in Canadian history.",

Hartley, a resident of Waterbury, represents the western half of the city as well as its southern suburbs of Naugatuck and Prospect in the Connecticut Senate. Hartley was born in Waterbury and graduated from Elms College and received a M.A. from Trinity College. Prior to being elected to the Connecticut Senate, Hartley served as a Connecticut state representative representing the 73rd District from 1984 to 2000. Hartley's predecessor as a state representative was future Governor John G. Rowland. Perhaps as a result, Hartley is generally considered among the more conservative and bipartisan members of the Democratic caucus. In 2007 she was believed to be the sole holdout from the strategy of Senate President Donald E. Williams, Jr. to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of a Democratic state bonding package. Rell had vetoed the package claiming it put the state too far into debt. Hartley opposed a billion dollar commitment to the Connecticut State University system and has been threatened with retribution from Democratic party leadership. On October 30 an agreement was reached between the Rell Administration, legislative Democratic leaders and Senator Hartley to resolve the bonding stalemate. The final bonding package was reduced by $400 million from the level vetoed by Rell and increased oversight was placed on funds for the Connecticut State University system. The Courant later reported that pressure was placed on fellow senators against Hartley by Senator Thomas Gaffey, who had an undisclosed intimate relationship with the lobbyist for the university system. In December 2008, Hartley was removed as the Chairman of the Higher Education Committee because of her independence and willingness to stand up to the Democratic leadership who was shielding Gaffey. In 2008, Hartley was one of three Democrats who supported Governor M. Jodi Rell's proposal for a Three Strikes Law against career violent criminals. In 2009, Hartley was the only Democrat in the State Senate that did not vote to override Governor M. Jodi Rell's veto of the Healthcare Partnership bill, thereby preventing the bill from becoming law. In 2011, Hartley and Paul Doyle were the only two Democrats to vote against transgender rights legislation.",

Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

  "text" : "John Hottinger is a Minnesota attorney and politician and a former member and majority leader of the Minnesota Senate. First elected in 1990, he was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002. A Democrat, he represented the old District 24 prior to the 2002 redistricting, and the current District 23 thereafter. The district included portions of Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Sibley and Waseca counties in the south central part of the state. Hottinger served as a majority whip from 1993 to 2000, and as an assistant majority leader during the 2001–02 biennium. He was chosen majority leader in 2003 after Senator Roger Moe retired to run for governor. After a difficult year, in which the DFL Party majority was seen to have been outmaneuvered by Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty, Hottinger stepped down, turning power over to Senator Dean Johnson. In January 2004, he was selected the national legislator of the month by the Center for Policy Alternatives one month after Illinois legislator Barack Obama won the honor Hottinger has been quoted as saying the two of them have since taken “divergent” paths. The CPA praised Hottinger “…for disowning budget cuts and yet giving the GOP enough votes on the budget bills so that government would not be shut down, which would have imposed further pain on vulnerable Minnesotans and state employees.” The CPA added that he had \"strengthened the progressive community for battles in 2004 and beyond.\" During his time in the Senate, Hottinger chaired the following committees: Health and Family Security, Rules, and Early Childhood Policy and Finance division of the Finance Committee. He also chaired the Legislative Committee to Review Administrative Rules and Senate Subcommittees on Insurance, Consumer Protection, Rulemaking, and Higher Education, Senate Budget, Personnel, Ethical Conduct, Permanent and Joint Rules, Intergovernmental Relations and Property Taxes. Hottinger was active in the [Council of State Governments] (CSG) and chaired the [Midwestern Legislative Conference] in 2001. He became the national chair of CSG in 2004 in leadership partnership with Governor [Frank Murkowski] of Alaska who served as CSG President. He was the first Minnesota legislator or Governor to serve as the national leader of the organization other than Governor Harold Stassen who was National President in 1941-42. Hottinger chose not to run for re-election in 2006. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney. In 2007, he faced disciplinary action for misusing funds from a settlement that he had won for a client in his work as an attorney.[3] He was suspended for a minimum of 18 months, petitioned to lift the suspension on June 17, 2010 and the Minnesota Supreme Court returned him to practice on January 12, 2011 finding him “prepared and morally qualified” to practice law. The Supreme Court decision  followed a hearing before the Minnesota Board of Lawyer's Professional Responsibility Board on November 18. 2010 and its unanimous decision to recommend reinstatement. There were no witnesses in opposition to the reinstatement and Hottinger’s eleven character witness included local attorneys and colleagues from the political world including DFL Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, former DFL Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, former Republican U.S. Senator David Durenberger and former Republican Party Chair Charles “Chuck” Slocum. After leaving the Senate, Hottinger worked for about four years as the chief consultant for some non-profit organizations funded by Minnesota-Washington philanthropist Ned Crosby: the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Process and Promoting Health Democracy in Minnesota and, on a limited basis, Health Democracy Oregon in Portland, Oregon. That work focused on Crosby’s Citizen Jury process for promoting citizen engagement through deliberative democracy. Hottinger was the Project Director for the Citizen Jury on Election Recounts concentrating on the process used in Minnesota in the recount of the U.S. Senate race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman in 2009. Hottinger was also a leader as the initial Vice President for Legal and Government Affairs for “The Minnesota World’s Fair”, the organization which launched the effort to bring the World’s Fair to Minnesota in 2022 or 2023. Hottinger has been active in non-profits including serving on the Executive Committee and as Chair of the Northstar (Minnesota) Chapter of the Sierra Club, a member of the Board and Executive Committee of the Northeast Midwest Institute in Washington, D.C. and as a member of the Board of the Somali Justice Center in Minneapolis.

James Clement Baxter was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, on 1 July 1857. His father, William Baxter, was originally from Clitheroe and his mother, Ann Hughes, was from Liverpool. His father was Church of England and his mother was Roman Catholic. His father was a chemist and druggist in Great Homer Street Everton, Liverpool. His mother's father, James Hughes, was from Ireland. Baxter was a Licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, renamed Royal College of Physicians of Ireland from 1890 when, under charter of Queen Victoria, it adopted the present title. According to college records he was admitted on 13 December 1878. He had received his medical training at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary and, presumably, made the short journey to Dublin just to sit the examination (as many English doctors did). After qualifying as a doctor he set up a practice in Robson Street Liverpool. Baxter was initially a medical adviser for Everton F.C. and later he reluctantly became the club's chairman. In 1892 he advanced the club a loan of £1000 to develop Goodison Park.",

Wilson graduated from Harry Collinge high school in Hinton, Alberta. He completed a broadcasting diploma at Mount Royal College in Calgary in 2000. He worked in the communications field as an employee with AVW-TELAV, a North American audiovisual solutions company. Wilson served as president of the Broadcasting Society from 1999 to 2000 while attending Mount Royal college. An active member of his community, he has volunteered at Calgary’s Ronald McDonald House and with the Calgary Women’s Emergency Shelter. He is a member of the Standing Committee on Legislative Offices and the Standing Committee on Families and Communities. He also serves as a member of the Select Special Conflicts of Interest Act Review Committee. As a politician, Wilson has been known for his good humour after asking two government ministers \"Why are you so awesome?\" and the deputy premier, \"Why is your hair so awesome?\" during Question Period on the last day of the 2012 fall session. In the 2013 spring sitting, Wilson furthered his reputation for good humour when he gained access to the government whip's notepad and sent notes to Progressive Conservative MLAs while in the Legislative Assembly, some of which advised MLAs to more enthusiastically applaud their government colleagues. Wilson was an outspoken critic of changes to the funding model for persons with developmental disabilities in the 2013-2014 provincial budget, and called on the government to reduce administrative costs. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Progressive Conservative caucus. Wilson lost his reelection campaign in 2015 to the NDP's Graham Sucha.",

He was known as Johnny De Pow by his constituents. Along with Bathhouse John Coughlin and Hinky Dink Kenna, Powers was considered one of the leaders of the \"Gray Wolves\" of Chicago politics. Powers arrived in Chicago in 1872 and began working as an apprentice to a grocer. After opening his own grocery store, he added a tavern next to it and used his exposure there to begin a political career as a ward captain. In 1888, Powers ran for alderman of Chicago's 19th ward and won, after which he closed his grocery, but continued to run his saloon, eventually going into business with fellow an alderman, William O'Brian, to open a larger saloon which included gambling. Powers introduced the practice of distributing free turkeys, ducks, and geese to voters at Christmas, but his inability to keep his ward clean of garbage or maintain the schools led Jane Addams to target him. Addams also focused on Powers' corruption, citing instances of cronyism and bribery. Powers, in turn, used Addams's attacks on him to brand her as anti-Catholic, but he also hired her to be the ward's garbage inspector, the only paying job she ever held. In 1903, Powers ran against incumbent Peter F. Galligan for the state senate. During the campaign, Galligan showed up at Powers's home and attacked him with a brickbat. Powers won the election, but the following year he returned to Chicago and was reelected to serve as the 19th ward alderman, a position he retained until 1927. By the 1910s, the ethnic makeup of his ward had begun to change. Instead of being 90 percent Irish, it was only about 50 percent Irish, with the remainder being made up of Italian and Jewish immigrants. On September 28, 1920, a bomb exploded at Powers' home at 1284 Macalister shortly after he arrived, this proved to be the opening salvo in the 1921 aldermanic election. In 1921, Anthony D'Andrea, who Powers had supported for ward committeeman in 1919, but pulled his support after the Supreme Court negated D'Andrea's initial victory, challenged Powers for his seat as alderman. The election was marked by violence, which continued after Powers won the election by 381 votes. Shortly after the election, D'Andrea was assassinated. This election was the culmination of the Aldermen's Wars. Powers died as his home at 6038 Sheridan Road, on May 19, 1930, suffering from pulmonary edema and anemia, although he had been suffering throat tumors since 1929.",

He was born February 2, 1852, in Galashiels, Selkirkshire, Scotland, the son of Edward Rodley and Sarah Ellis. His father Edward was a manufacturer of wool. His mother Sarah died in Scotland. The family emigrated to the United States in about 1868, and settled in Lebanon, Missouri. Although, he was still very young at the time, John began his study of medicine under Dr. Hugh Falconer in Scotland. He continued his studies in America at Missouri Medical College (also called McDowell Medical College) in St. Louis from where he was graduated in 1881. He began to practice medicine in Lebanon, where he resided until 1884. He moved to St. Louis, where he continued his practice for four more years, where he was on the Missouri Pacific Hospital, the railroad hospital. He also served as surgeon for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. In 1888, Dr. Rodley left Missouri for California and located in Chico. In Chico, he practiced medicine, and served on the Chico Board of Trustees, and as its President. He owed four farms, where he raised grains, fruits and nuts. In 1899, Rodley was sentenced to 12 years in prison after being found guilty of perjury in the witnessing of a forged will offered for probate. He was granted parole in 1906.",

Manning was appointed to cabinet by Premier Paul Davis despite not holding a seat in the House of Assembly. Manning's appointment to cabinet came under fire due to her not being an elected member and because she was unwilling to seek a seat in the House of Assembly in three by-elections. Manning stated she intended to be the Progressive Conservative candidate in the district of Placentia—St. Mary's when that seat became available. The seat is currently represented by Felix Collins who had previously indicated he would not seek re-election. On March 12, 2015, Manning was removed from cabinet along with two other ministers. Davis cited cost savings as his reason for reducing his cabinet but also noted he was unwilling to have Manning serve in cabinet for up to a year without her holding a seat in the legislature. Davis said he had originally planned on calling a spring election but that was delayed till the fall by his government's decision to remove eight seats from he House of Assembly. It was later reported that when Manning was appointed to cabinet she and Davis were under the impression that Collins would resign his seat in the near future, creating a by-election for her to run in. However, Collins did not resign his seat and he found himself back in cabinet as Attorney General after Manning's departure due to him being the only lawyer within caucus.",

Smith ran again in the 1984 election, defeating Weldon by 903 votes to win the Dartmouth East riding. One of only six Liberals elected, Smith spent the early years of his political career in opposition. He was re-elected in the 1988 election, winning the seat by 253 votes. Smith was re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating cabinet minister Gwen Haliburton by almost 2,500 votes. Following the election, Smith would get to sit in government for the first time, as the Liberals under John Savage won a majority government. On June 11, 1993, Smith was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Community Services. On June 27, 1996, Savage shuffled his cabinet, with Smith being named Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs. On June 6, 1997, Savage announced that Smith would take over as Minister of Health on June 9, when Bernie Boudreau resigns from cabinet to run for the Liberal leadership. Smith remained as Minister of Health when Russell MacLellan took over as premier on July 18, 1997. Smith was re-elected in the 1998 election, and retained the health portfolio, but was also named Minister of Justice. In December 1998, Smith was replaced as Minister of Justice, as MacLellan shuffled his cabinet to reduce the heavy workload of some of the cabinet. Smith was re-elelcted by 265 votes in the 1999 election, but the Liberals were defeated by John Hamm's Progressive Conservatives. Smith served in opposition for one term, announcing on May 2, 2003, that he would not seek re-election in the next election.",

  "text" : "Earl Russell Browder (May 20, 1891 – June 27, 1973) was an American political activist, functionary and leader of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Browder is best remembered as the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s. During World War I, Browder served time in federal prison as a conscientious objector to conscription and the war. Upon his release, Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the Communist International and its Red International of Labor Unions in China and the Pacific region. In 1930, following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership, Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA. For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American Communism, authoring dozens of pamphlets and books, making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences, and twice running for President of the United States. Browder also took part in clandestine activities on behalf of Soviet intelligence in America during his period of party leadership, placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence. In the wake of public outrage over the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact, Browder was indicted for passport fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942 the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity. Browder was a staunch adherent of close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II and envisioned continued cooperation between these two military powers in the postwar years. Coming to see the role of American Communists to be that of an organized pressure group within a broad governing coalition, in 1944 he directed the transformation of the CPUSA into a \"Communist Political Association.\" However, following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Cold War and internal red scare quickly sprouted up. Browder was expelled from the re-established Communist Party early in 1946, due largely to a refusal to modify these views to accord with changing political realities and their associated ideological demands. Browder lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity at his home in Yonkers, New York, attempting with little success to influence American government policy and public opinion as the author of numerous books and pamphlets.",

Born to Stephen and Helen (née Lang) Kelly, he was the first of five Chicago mayors from Bridgeport of Chicago's South Side. Kelly was the chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District in the 1920s. He was sponsored by Patrick Nash, the owner of a sewer-contracting company that did millions of dollars of business with the city. He subsequently became president of the South Park Board, a position that presided over the building of Soldier Field. Under his tenure Soldier Field cost $8 million, while a similar Los Angeles stadium only cost $1.7 million. Kelly was Mayor of Chicago during the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair (Century of Progress) which took place during the Great Depression which included the successful playing of the first official Major League Baseball All-Star Game; Kelly initiated for holding a major sport event for the fair to the Chicago Tribune. Kelly was famous for banning Nelson Algren's 1942 book Never Come Morning, a novel, from the Chicago Public Library; the ban remained in force for decades due to the outcry by Chicago Polonia upon its release. Following the assassination of Mayor Anton Cermak, Kelly was hand-picked by his friend, Patrick Nash, Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, for the mayoral election of 1933. Together, Kelly and Nash built one of the most powerful, and most corrupt, big city political organizations, called the \"Kelly-Nash Machine\". In 1947, Kelly acquiesced to the Cook County Democratic Party's decision to slate a candidate with reform credentials for mayor of Chicago and was succeeded by Martin H. Kennelly.",

  "text" : "Ewout Irrgang (Utrecht, 20 juli 1976) is een Nederlands politicus voor de Socialistische Partij (SP). Irrgang werd geboren in Utrecht. Hij volgde het vwo te Breukelen en studeerde vanaf 1994 politicologie aan de Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Daarnaast studeerde hij tot 2000 economie aan de Universiteit van Amsterdam. Bij deze universiteit rondde hij in 1999 ook zijn politicologiestudie af. Irrgang werd in 1997 lid van de SP. Begin januari 1998 richtte hij samen met Elisabeth van der Steenhoven het Nieuw Republikeins Genootschap (NRG) op, als tegenhanger van het Republikeins Genootschap dat leden alleen toeliet door coöptatie. Hij was voorzitter van het NRG tot 2001. In 2001 trad hij terug als voorzitter omdat hij kandidaat-Kamerlid werd voor de SP. Hij was sinds 1998 beleidsmedewerker van de Tweede Kamerfractie van deze partij, met als portefeuille Financiën. Irrgang was ook lid van het afdelingsbestuur in Amsterdam, en maakte van 1999 tot mei 2005 deel uit van het partijbestuur van de SP. Op 29 september 2005 werd bekend dat hij het SP-kamerlid Piet de Ruiter per 4 oktober zou opvolgen. Irrgang, op dat moment werkzaam bij de monetaire afdeling van De Nederlandsche Bank, stond weliswaar op de twaalfde plaats, maar twee personen die hoger op de lijst stonden zagen af van een kamerlidmaatschap. Irrgang kreeg de portefeuilles Economische Zaken en Financiën, en Binnenlandse Zaken. Hij werd beëdigd als Tweede Kamerlid op 6 oktober 2005 en hield zijn maidenspeech op 11 oktober, tijdens een debat over de mogelijke onevenredige verhoging van de energieprijzen. Bij zowel de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2006 als die van 2010 stond Irrgang op plaats zes op de kandidatenlijst. Hij kondigde in mei 2012 aan zich niet herkiesbaar te stellen voor de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen in september dat jaar. Sinds september 2013 werkt Irrgang als technisch directeur voor de Nederlandse stichting PharmAccess in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Die stichting zet zich in voor betaalbare gezondheidszorg in Afrika.",

  "text" : "Eva Aariak (* 10. Januar 1955 in Arctic Bay, Nunavut) ist eine kanadische Inuit-Politikerin und war von 2008 bis 2013 Premier des kanadischen Territoriums Nunavut. Aariak, Mutter von vier Kindern und Großmutter, war als Radio- und TV-Reporterin tätig, leitete das Büro für öffentliche Angelegenheiten des Interim Commissioners von Nunavut und war danach von 1999 bis 2003, dann um ein weiteres Jahr verlängert bis 2004, die erste Sprachenbeauftragte (Languages Commissioner) für das Territorium Nunavut. In dieser Zeit führte sie zum Beispiel das Wort „Ikiaqqivik“ (wörtlich „Reisen durch Schichten“) als Inuktitutwort für „Internet“ ein, einen Begriff, der das traditionelle Reisen von Schamanen durch Zeit und Raum zur Beantwortung spiritueller und materieller Fragen umschreibt. Anschließend betätigte sie sich als Inuktitut-Lehrerin am Pirurvik Centre in Iqaluit, einer Beratungsgesellschaft für Inuit-Kultur. 2006 eröffnete sie in Iqaluit einen Store für Inuit-Kunst und -Kunsthandwerk, den sie „Malikkaat“ nannte (ein Inuktitut-Wort für das Ausrichten von Blüten nach der Sonne). Sie hatte außerdem folgende Positionen inne: Koordinatorin eines Inuktitut-Lehrbuchprogramms des „Baffin Divisional Education Council“, Präsidentin der Handelskammer der Baffin-Region und Vorsitzende der Nunavut-Film-Entwicklungsgesellschaft. 2007 übernahm sie erneut die Aufgabe einer Sprachenbeauftragten für Nunavut. Bei der Territorial-Wahl am 27. Oktober 2008 wurde sie für den Wahlbezirk Iqaluit-Ost erstmals in die Abgeordnetenkammer (Legislative Assembly) von Nunavut gewählt und ist das einzige weibliche Mitglied dieses Parlaments. Bei der Wahl des Premiers von Nunavut am 14. November 2008 im Nunavut-Führungsforum erhielt sie vor dem bisherigen Amtsinhaber Paul Okalik und dem Mitbewerber Tagak Curley die meisten Stimmen und war dadurch die einzige Frau (und fünfte Frau überhaupt) unter den Premierministern kanadischer Provinzen und Territorien. Bei der Wahl am 28. Oktober 2013 verlor Aariak ihren Sitz im Abgeordnetenhaus, nachdem sie bereits vorher angekündigt hatte, nicht erneut als Premierministerin kandidieren zu wollen.",

  "text" : "Ensign Washer or Ensign Thos (Thomas) Washer was an early Virginia colonist who settled in the area that became Isle of Wight County, Virginia. Washer and Christopher Lawne represented Lawne's Plantation as burgesses in the first assembly of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the lower house of the colonial Virginia General Assembly, in 1619. \"Ensign\" is a military grade or rank, not the colonist's first name, and there is some suggestion that he was a lower ranking military officer before he arrived in Virginia. He also would have been a member of the local militia after his arrival in Virginia. Sources seem to be uniform in their identification of Washer as \"Ensign\" and only one source has been found which states that his name was \"Thos\" (Thomas). Even if this is true and can be verified, the colonist is shown as Ensign Washer here because that is how he is shown in sources which identify him as a member of the first session of the House of Burgesses. Before 1619, Ensign Washer, Captain Nathaniel Basse and Giles Jones received patents for land along the Pagan River. Captain Christopher Lawne then settled near the mouth of Lawne's Creek in the same vicinity. Although the area was known as Lawne's Plantation and its representatives were listed as representatives from the plantation, the colonists also had named the area \"Warresqueak County\" after the Native American tribe who lived there. Washer and Christopher Lawne represented Lawne's Plantation in the first assembly of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619. In 1620, a movement began to change the name of \"Warresqueak County\" to \"Isle of Wight County\" but this was not done until 1637. The Daughters of the American Revolution state that Ensign Washer had a daughter named Margaret (Polly). Little if anything more is known about Ensign Washer or what may have become of him. Records do not show him as among the dead of the Indian massacre of 1622 nor do they list him in the muster of 1624. Yet his name survives as a member of the first representative assembly in the areas that would become both the State of Virginia and the United States of America.",

  "text" : "Will Morin is a Canadian politician, currently the interim leader of the First Peoples National Party of Canada. Morin was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and is a member of the Michipicoten First Nation. He was a medical assistant in the Canadian Forces during the 1991 Gulf War. He later obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, as well as a Bachelor of Arts degree in Native Studies and a Master of Arts degree in Humanities from Laurentian University. He is now a teacher, artist and cultural consultant in Sudbury, and was seeking a PhD in human studies from Laurentian at the time of the 2008 election. Morin has served on the board of the Sudbury Arts Council, was a founder of the White Mountain Academy of the Arts, and is a strong advocate for local artists. In 2003, he proposed a community arts centre for downtown Sudbury. His own works have been displayed nationally. He first ran as the party's candidate in Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing in the 2006 election, and subsequently ran in Sudbury in the 2008 election and the 2011 election. In both 2006 and 2008, Morin was the party's most successful candidate in number of votes received; in 2011, he was the party's only candidate. Morin was the Eastern Regional Representative for Aboriginal Students with the Canadian Federation of Students while attending university, and became politically active as president of the Young Liberals Association at Cambrian College. He later joined the FPNP, and was nominated as the party's first candidate for public office on December 28, 2005. In 2008, he argued that he was campaigning on a platform of aboriginal values, and fighting for the inclusion of aboriginal people in the political process. During the 2008 election campaign, he was excluded from an all-candidates debate on CIGM, and all four of the major party candidates — Liberal Diane Marleau, Conservative Gerry Labelle, New Democrat Glenn Thibeault and Green Gordon Harris — chose to boycott the debate rather than participate without Morin present. Although he received few votes, he said after the election that he accomplished what he set out to achieve. In 2006, Morin took part in a protest in support of a road blockade by the members of the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation in Brant. He later took part in a protest against the Canadian Pacific Spirit Train during the 2008 election. The Spirit Train was intended to raise support for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver; many protesters argued that the games were taking place on stolen native land.",

  "text" : "William Bruce Harvey (June 2, 1907 – March 1, 1954) was a Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Nipissing in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1948 to 1954. He was a member of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. He was born to Isabella Gibson (1878–1948) and Robert Harvie (1874–1929) in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, Scotland on June 2, 1907. In 1912, Robert and his oldest child Mary, sailed for Canada and settled in the Ottawa area. In June 1913, Isabella and William, along with three other siblings (Katie, Isabella and Jessie) sailed to Canada on the Teutonic and joined Robert and Mary in Ottawa. The purser of the Teutonic spelled the surname incorrectly and the family retained the new spelling of Harvey since all immigration documents used the ship’s registry information. Wiliam Harvey spent his teenage years in Ottawa. He moved to North Bay in 1923 to open a Keyes Supply Company office. His younger brother Bruce Harvey remained in Ottawa and was an alderman from 1961–1969, representing Elmdale-Victoria Ward, and working with Charlotte Whitton from 1960-64. Harvey met and married Eva Belle Moore (1907–1970) on June 3, 1929. They had three children: Edith Joan (1932–1996), Robert Walter (born 1934) and Isabel Diane (1937–1992). He was a commercial traveller and active member of the Canadian Travellers Association (CTA) and the Masonic Shrine Temple, North Bay Lodge #617. In 1940 he went into business for himself, and partnered with Don Seal to open Harvey Seal Motors (Mercury dealership) in 1942 located at Main Street West. Harvey was elected councillor for West Ferris Township, Ontario and served for 4 years before he entered the provincial political arena. He was elected as a Progressive Conservative MPP on June 7, 1948 and served the majority of his office in the government of Leslie Frost. He was appointed Vice Chairman of the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission in 1949 as well as Industrial Commissioner for Northern Ontario. The city of North Bay named Harvey Street and Harvey Street School in his honour. Harvey was re-elected to the provincial legislature in 1951 and served until his death on March 1, 1954.",

  "text" : "Walter Hoyt (also seen as Haite, Hayte, Hoit, Haight) (September 6, 1618 – 1698) was a founding settler of Norwalk, Connecticut. He served as a deputy of the General Court of the Connecticut Colony from Norwalk between 1658 and 1662, and, when it was renamed, as a deputy of the Connecticut General Assembly between 1662 and 1681. He was a Norwalk selectman in 1672. He was the son of Simon Haite and Deborah Stowers. He came to America in 1628, with his father and brother, Nicholas Hoyt, at the age of ten. In 1640, he was known to own about 64 acres of land in Windsor, Connecticut Colony. In 1653, Walter came to Norwalk, among the first settlers. He served in the General Court of the Connecticut Colony in the sessions of October 1658, May and October 1661, May and October 1667, October 1668, May 1670, May 1671, May 1672, October 1673, October 1674, May 1676, May 1678, and October of 1681. In May 1672 Walter Hoyte was among those whose names were given to the General Court \"for the beginning of a plantation neare the backside of Norwalke.\" He, along with Ralph Keeler, was contracted by the settlement to cut the timber and build a house for Reverend Thomas Hanford. He voted in the town meetings in Norwalk, and was confirmed by the General Court as one of the proprietors of Norwalk in 1685. Hoyt's Hill, named after Walter Hoyt, is the historical name of the hill in the Green at the northeast corner of East Avenue and Willow Street. The place name dates back at least as early as 1679. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery.",

He first announced his retirement from politics in 2000, and was succeeded as mayor by Jamie Lim. In the 2003 municipal election, however, Power challenged Lim and was re-elected mayor. Power has also served as president of the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities, and as a director of Ontario Northland Transportation Commission and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Power's mayoralty has been marked by ongoing efforts to diversify the city's mining-based economy. In 2004, he received national attention when he criticized the producers of Shania: A Life in Eight Albums, a television biopic of country star Shania Twain, for producing the film in Sudbury rather than Twain's actual hometown, Timmins. On August 31, 2006, Power announced his second retirement from politics; he would not be seeking the mayoralty in the 2006 elections. He was succeeded by Tom Laughren, the sole declared candidate for the mayoralty. On May 31, 2007, the city's airport was renamed Timmins/Victor M. Power Airport in honor of the former mayor. In attendance were several councillors and politicians from across the region. Power received the Order of Canada in 2009.",

His political journey began after he was elected the Sarpanch or head of his Sofi village (Jalandhar District). He has held several key posts in the BJP's Punjab unit. When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled.",

Mayencourt was first elected in the 2001 provincial election, defeating New Democrat opponent Tim Stevenson. He was previously the founder and, for its first five years, executive director of the Vancouver Friends for Life Society, which supports people living with AIDS, cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. He is the founder of the BC New Hope Recovery Society and Baldy Hughes Therapeutic Community in North Central BC which supports addicts in a long-term recovery community. In the 2005 election, conflicting results throughout the night had both Mayencourt and Stevenson declared the victor in Vancouver-Burrard, and the uncertainty continued for several weeks. In the final count of regular ballots, Stevenson was declared the winner by 17 votes; however, when absentee ballots were counted on May 30, Mayencourt was declared the winner by a margin of 18 votes. After a judicial recount, Mayencourt was declared the victor by 11 votes. He is known for his Private Member's Bill called the Safe Streets Act (2004), which aimed to deter aggressive panhandling. He chaired the provincial Safe Schools Task Force (2003) and introduced the Safe Schools Act (2005) to combat bullying in the school system based on racism, sexism and homophobia. He introduced the Apology Act to facilitate sincere and timely reconciliation between government, business and citizens. Mayencourt announced that he would not run in the 2009 provincial election, and resigned early to run as the Conservative Party of Canada's candidate in Vancouver Centre for the 2008 general election. He lost to incumbent Liberal MP Hedy Fry. Mayencourt announced that he would seek the BC Liberal Party nomination in the riding of Vancouver-False Creek for the British Columbia general election, 2013 after the current incumbent Mary McNeil announced she would not be seeking another term. His main competition is Sam Sullivan. Mayencourt currently lives in Vancouver, B.C.",

Atienza is als toegewijd katholiek een voorstander van de pro-life programma's in de Filipijnen en liet dit ook terugkomen in het beleid tijdens zijn periode als burgemeester van Manilla. Zo introduceerde hij in 2000 een verordening die het gebruik van natuurlijke anticonceptie, zoals onthouding, aanmoedigde en het gebruik van anticonceptiemiddelen zoals de pil, condooms en steralisatie ontmoedigde. Publieke gezondheidsinstanties krijgen sinds die tijd geen subsidie meer voor dergelijke anticeptie middelen. In 2008 werd door een twintigtal arme vrouwen een rechtszaak aangespannen om deze verordening die ook onder zijn opvolger Alfredo Lim nog in werking was, aan te vechten.",

Bond was one of the founders of the Republican party in Chicago. In 1862 and 1864 he was elected a Chicago alderman. In 1867, he was elected to the Illinois General Assembly, and served until 1871. When Chicago Mayor and newspaper publisher Joseph Medill traveled to Europe in 1873, Medill named Bond acting mayor of Chicago. When Medill's term expired that same year, Bond ran as an independent on a law and order platform, supporting laws which would ban the sale of liquor on Sundays. He was defeated by Harvey Colvin, who won with 60% of the voted despite Bond receiving the endorsements of all Chicago newspapers except the Times. Bond married Mary Aspenwall and they had one daughter, Laura, who was born in 1867.",

Irvin, and upon the expiration of Irvin's term, he was elected mayor by a large majority. He served two non-consecutive terms as mayor from 1918 to 1922, and from 1926 to 1930. Hodgson also ran for governor in 1920, but came third in the race, garnering only 81,293 votes. After Hodgson's death in 1937, his son, Laurence K.

  "text" : "Craig Anthony Washington (born October 12, 1941) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Texas who served in the Texas State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. The son of Roy and Azalia Washington, Washington graduated from Prairie View A&M University in 1966 and was originally interested in becoming a doctor, but as admissions to medical school had already ceased, Washington decided to instead apply at Texas Southern University's law school. In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. \"Mickey\" Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the \"People's Five\"), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989. Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas's 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district. In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and still holds the seat today. Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas. On New Year's Day 2008, Washington shot at a car containing two teenagers. After being indicted by a grand jury in 2009, he agreed to two years of probation. However, Washington's attorney subsequently claimed that Washington fired because his life was in danger. Washington has since countersued the teenagers, alleging assault and property damage. The Internal Revenue Service has also sued Washington, alleging that he owes $610,000 in unpaid taxes. On January 8, 2015, Washington received a suspension of his Texas attorney's license. The 335th District Court of Bastrop County, Texas found that Washington had violated various rules, including the rules prohibiting neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him and failing to keep a client reasonably informed. On March 12, 2015, a \"modified judgment was entered imposing a four-year partially probated suspension with 12 months active.\" He was also ordered to pay over $24,600 in legal fees and expenses. Washington filed an appeal.",

He was succeeded by former mayor Jack Ford in 2002. Following his first administration, Finkbeiner served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board. He joined the ABC affiliate in Toledo and hosted Carty & Company, a Sunday morning public affairs show. He also contributed a weekly editorial segment, It's Just Not Right! Finkbeiner left WTVG in May 2005. On June 30, 2005, Finkbeiner announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. He won the Toledo mayoral primary, winning roughly 37% of the vote in comparison to 29% earned by incumbent Ford. On November 8, 2005, Finkbeiner was re-elected mayor. Finkbeiner was sworn in for his third term as mayor in a private ceremony on January 3, 2006. Finkbeiner has proved to be a very controversial mayor for the city of Toledo due to many of his policies, behavior, and public gaffes (see \"Controversy\" section). Toward the end of Finkbeiner's third term as mayor a recall effort drive to remove him from office was successfully put on the ballot but was ultimately struck down by the Ohio Supreme Court due to technicalities. Carty announced that his third run as mayor will be his final one and he would not seek re-election. According to city finance records verified by the Toledo Blade Finkbeiner left the city with a 48 million dollar deficit  which was inherited by Ohio Fire Marshall Michael P. Bell, an Independent, who succeeded Carty Finkbiener in 2010. Finkbeiner currently resides with his wife, Amy Finkbeiner, in South Toledo. He has three children: Ryan, Jenny, and Katie, and five grandchildren. Carlton Finkbeiner announced plans to run for a fourth term as mayor of Toledo on August 29, 2015.",

  "text" : "Charlotte Anne Laws (born May 11, 1960) is an American author, talk show host, community activist, animal rights advocate, anti-revenge porn activist, former Los Angeles politician, and actress under the stage name Missy Laws. Laws was a weekly commentator on the television show The Filter with Fred Roggin from August 2009 until 2013 when the show went off the air. One of her episodes was nominated for an Emmy. Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet.",

As U.S. Attorney, Turner investigated sham marriages and immigration fraud organized by followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now known as Osho) in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, as well as other illegal activities including the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon. In 1985, high-ranking followers of Rajneesh plotted to murder Turner, carrying out steps including assembling a team, purchasing weapons, and performing surveillance on his office, home and car. Seven followers of Rajneesh were later convicted of conspiracy to assassinate him. While U.S. Attorney, Turner hired prosecutors Michael Mosman and Mark Bailey; both would later go on to serve as U.S. Attorney for Oregon.

He was born in Joliet, Illinois on September 22, 1867, the son of William F. Stewart (b. Ohio) and Julia Ann Hutchins (b. Maysville, Kentucky). He married Annie Mabel Nash in Titusville on May 24, 1888. She was the daughter of Clarence and Annie Hyatt Nash, a wealthy family from Norwalk, Connecticut with a home in Daytona. He and his wife Annie Mabel Nash Stewart came to Melbourne in 1888. They were well educated and cultured, but wanted to be pioneers. He was elected mayor in 1890 when he was only 23. He opened a hardware store and mortuary on New Haven Ave named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Frank Fee, who would also serve as mayor. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. In 1908, he was a presidential elector for the Republican Party. Documentation exists from as early as 1898 in the form of letters and invoices, books and newspaper articles reflecting his business was already located at 1002 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL. In 1919, Stewart's Front Street store burned down, along with most of the downtown businesses in \"The Great Fire.\" After this time, the downtown was no longer in that area, but moved to the west side of U.S. 1. Stewart moved his business to New Haven Avenue. He may have moved his business to 1002 E New Haven Ave before the fire of 1919. In 1920, he was a co-founder of the Melbourne Golf and Country Club. He died in Melbourne, Florida, on June 18, 1936. He was buried in Daytona Beach, Florida.",

Bishop served as a member of the Australian House of Representatives for the Liberal Party, representing the Division of Mackellar in New South Wales from 1994 to 2016. Earlier, between 1987 and 1994, she represented New South Wales in the Senate. Bishop held portfolios in the outer ministry during the first two terms of the Howard Government, serving as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel from 1996 to 1998 and as Minister for Aged Care from 1998 to 2001. In October 2014, she surpassed Kathy Sullivan's record for the longest period of parliamentary service by a woman. From July 2015, Bishop was subject to sustained intense media and public scrutiny regarding her use of parliamentary entitlements, including a helicopter charter to a party fundraiser during her time as speaker. Although Prime Minister Tony Abbott had originally been one of her strongest allies, she eventually lost his support, resigning from the speakership and moving to the backbench on 2 August to be replaced as speaker by Tony Smith. On 16 April 2016, Bishop was defeated by Jason Falinski in a Liberal Party preselection ballot (51 votes to 39) for the Division of Mackellar at the 2016 federal election.",

  "text" : "Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a distinguished career in North America with the British Army, Roche became a member of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politics—they were riddled with mixed metaphors (\"Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud\"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase (\"Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?\"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.While arguing for a bill, Roche once said, \"It would surely be better, Mr. Speaker, to give up not only a part, but, if necessary, even the whole, of our constitution, to preserve the remainder!\" While these Irish bulls have led many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers have interpreted them not as blunders, but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour. Roche ended his political career with the passage of the Act of Union 1800, which he supported. He chose not to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death, married but childless, in 1807.",

Morris married Evelina Barker in Kentucky in 1832 and the couple moved to Chicago in 1834 where Morris established a law practice with J. Young Scammon and created the Chicago Lyceum, the city's first literary society. By 1835, however, Morris had left Scammon and was practicing law with Edward Casey. He was elected mayor of Chicago in 1838 and went on to serve terms as a city alderman. He ran for the office of Illinois Secretary of State in 1852 under the Whig ticket and served as a Lake County Circuit Court Judge from 1853-1855. Following Evelina's death in 1847, he married Eliza Stephenson in 1850. Eliza died in 1855. The former mayor was outspoken in his opposition the American Civil War and was suspected to sympathise with the \"Copperheads.\" In 1864, he was arrested for aiding in a Confederate attempt to free prisoners of war from Camp Douglas. He was held for 9 months, but was then exonerated by a military court. Being unable, while so detained, to attend to his business affairs, he lost most of his assets through foreclosures. Incensed over the treatment of their ancestor, his heirs refused to permit the donation of his historical material, diaries, etc., to the Chicago Historical Society, despite urging to that end. The first use recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary of the phrase, to hell in a hand basket, is in The Great North-Western Conspiracy in All Its Startling Details, by I. Windslow Ayer, in alleging that, at a meeting of the Order of the Sons of Liberty, Judge Morris of the Circuit Court of Illinois said: \"Thousands of our best men were prisoners in Camp Douglas, and if once at liberty would 'send abolitionists to hell in a hand basket.'\"",

He is a Democrat. Hansen was appointed to the Council when the incumbent alderman, John Merlo, unexpectedly resigned. In 1987 he defeated Dr. Ron Sable, a liberal gay activist, by a 52% to 47% margin in the race for 44th Ward alderman. It was a hard-fought campaign in the city's 44th Ward, which at the time was the heart of the city's gay community. Sable ran against Hansen again in 1991, but Hansen prevailed again, 65% to 35%. From 1994 to 2000, he served as one of four U.S. commissioners to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a presidential appointment to a bilateral treaty organization with Canada responsible for fisheries management research and recommendations and for sea lamprey control for the Great Lakes fisheries. For part of that time, he chaired the commission. He sponsored or co-sponsored several human rights ordinances, including the Human Rights Ordinance expanding protection against discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodations, and credit to gay males, lesbians, and persons with disabilities, an ordinance to assist victims of hate crimes, and a 1997 ordinance Hansen introduced to extend health-care benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian city employees. Thomas M. Tunney, his successor as 44th Ward alderman whom Hansen had \"hand-picked\", became Chicago's first openly gay alderman. Hansen was also an active proponent of environmentalist measures, including recycling programs and the extension of Chicago's moratorium against the creation of new landfills. Some residents of the Lakeview community voiced concern that Hansen was more concerned with building expensive condos and co-ops, then re-building the neighborhood with affordable housing during his tenure. He serves on the board of many community councils as well as fund raising organizations, including the John Merlo Sports Program. John Merlo was the son of Mike Merlo leader of the Unione Siciliana during the 1920s. Mike Merlo had such complete control of the Organized Crime activities in Chicago, that upon his death in 1924, a war between north side gangs against Johnny Torrio (with underling) Al Capone at his side, instantly erupted. The war lasted 4 bloody years and included the St. Valentines Day Massacre. After his retirement from the city council, he continued to serve as Democratic committeeman from the 44th Ward, ultimately handing over the title to Alderman Tom Tunney. John Merlo held the position from 1969-92. Hansen made an attempt to be a Democratic Congressional Candidate for Illinois' 5th District in 2002, but when the Democratic National Committee backed Clinton Administration phenom Rahm Emanuel in the race, Hansen withdrew and soon after resigned from the 44th Ward Aldermanic seat. He is married to Annette and has two sons, Paul and David. He has two grandchildren. He attended the University of Chicago and has residences in both Chicago and Arizona. He is a longtime Cubs fan and avid golfer.",

Boyce grew up in Elm Creek, Manitoba, was educated at the University of Manitoba, and served as a signalman in the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1945. He later served as a school councillor at St. John's Technical High School. He supported Sidney Green for the leadership of the provincial NDP in 1968 and 1969. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Jim Cowan by almost 1,000 votes in the riding of Winnipeg Centre under the slogan Bud Boyce, your choice. He was not appointed to cabinet in the legislative term which followed, although he served as Deputy Speaker for a few months in 1971. In the 1973, he was re-elected by an increased majority over Tory candidate Robert Wilson. On June 26, 1974, Boyce entered cabinet as the Minister responsible for Corrections and Rehabilitations. He held this position until the Schreyer government was defeated in the 1977 election. Boyce was re-elected in the 1977 election, defeating Tory candidate Philip S. Lee with a reduced majority. In 1979, he supported Sidney Green's unsuccessful bid to become interim leader of the provincial NDP. On March 3, 1981, Boyce announced that he was joining Green's new Progressive Party of Manitoba, along with fellow New Democratic MLA Ben Hanuschak. He ran for re-election in the redistributed riding of Fort Rouge in the 1981 election, but fared poorly, receiving only 243 votes. After being defeated, Boyce worked as a consultant. He died at home in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1984, before the next election was held.",

Chamberlain's main challenger for the nomination was to be former Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Maine, who represented Guelph in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979. Maine dropped out of the race after the riding's nomination meeting was scheduled for an early date, arguing that this favoured Chamberlain. Chamberlain went on to win the Liberal nomination by acclamation. Maine later decided to run as an independent candidate against Chamberlain in the 1993 federal election. Chamberlain was elected handily as the Liberals took all but one of Ontario's 101 seats—the closest any party has come to sweeping the country's biggest province at the federal level. Chamberlain was re-elected by greater margins in the elections of 1997 and 2000. For many years, she was known as a strong supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party. Chamberlain won another easy victory in the election of 2004, defeating her Conservative opponent by nearly 10,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Guelph. Chamberlain was elected a fifth time in the election of 2006, in which the Conservative Party won a national minority government. She was one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus, and was a vocal opponent of her own party's plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Chamberlain also voted against her party's same-sex marriage bill in 2005. She was also involved in legislation which forced Bell Canada to revise its 411 billing policy. Chamberlain served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour from 1997 to 1999, and was parliamentary secretary to the president of the Queen's Privy Council, with special emphasis on public service reform and Métis and Non-Status Indians, from December 2003 to July 2004. Although opposition spread rumours that she was about to retire she stood for re-election in 2006 and won handily. Just over two years later, on March 7, 2008, Chamberlain announced her resignation from the House of Commons effective April 7. She did not provide a reason for her resignation. During that election and thereafter the Guelph Mercury subjected Chamberlain to increasing degrees of criticism. Hansard will show that Chamberlain's last official votes occurred during the finals of weeks of February 2008. Subsequently, in a 2008 by-election Liberal candidate Frank Valeriote was elected in the Guelph riding. Brenda Chamberlain served locally as a school trustee and federally as a Member of the House of Commons. She was elected for twenty-four consecutive years of public service.",

Berry achieved a level of notoriety for having banned both rock and roll music as well as an \"obscene\" film from Jersey City during his tenure. Berry banned the film The Moon Is Blue from being shown for being \"indecent and obscene\" and refused to allow Bill Haley and the Comets to play a concert at municipally-owned Roosevelt Stadium. The latter act is believed to have inspired Haley to write the first protest song in rock and roll, \"Teenager's Mother,\" which included the lyrics \"Are you right? Did you forget too soon? How much you liked to do the Charleston?\" In 1956, after the 1954 closing of the US immigration station, Berry commandeered a US Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim Ellis Island.",

Firth and Nordling thereafter sat as the only members of the Independent Alliance. Firth did not run in the 1996 election. She died on June 20, 2008 of cancer.",

  "text" : "William Neil \"Bill\" Rowe QC (born June 4, 1942) is a former politician, lawyer, broadcaster, and writer in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. He is married to Penelope Ayre Rowe of St. John’s, who is a member of the Order of Canada. They have a son, Dorian, a daughter, Toby, and three grandchildren. Rowe was born in Grand Bank and is the son of the late Liberal Senator Frederick William Rowe and the late Edith Laura Butt. Rowe attended Memorial University of Newfoundland where he earned a Bachelor of Arts. He studied for a Bachelor of Law at the University of New Brunswick on a Sir James Hamet Dunn Scholarship, and went on to become a Rhodes Scholar, graduating with an Honours M.A in Law from the University of Oxford. He entered politics and was elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly five times as a Liberal MHA, first at the age of twenty-four. He was appointed, at twenty-six, as a Cabinet Minister in the Government of Joey Smallwood and became responsible for several departments. He was later elected as Leader of the Opposition, holding that position from 1977 to 1979. He resigned his position prior to the 1979 general election, in favour of Don Jamieson, but kept his own seat. One of Rowe's political aides while he was Opposition Leader was a young Brian Tobin. In 1982, Rowe lost his seat in the Newfoundland general election, which saw the Progressive Conservatives under the leadership of Brian Peckford, win by a landslide, taking 44 seats. After leaving politics, Rowe resumed his law practice. As a lawyer, he practiced in St. John's for over three decades, concentrating for years on labour-management arbitrations. During the 1980s he was retained by the federal Minister of National Revenue to conduct a nationwide inquiry into fishermen’s perceived income tax problems with Revenue Canada. Rowe was appointed to Queen's Counsel in 2007. A long-time public affairs commentator, Rowe has appeared regularly on national and local television and radio. He has hosted a daily call-in show on VOCM and CFCB radio for nearly thirty years, which focuses on public issues and is carried throughout the province and around the world. Rowe was instrumental in exposing the Mount Cashel Orphanage scandal when he was host of VOCM's Open Line radio show. Rowe also wrote weekly public affairs columns for St. John's daily newspaper, The Telegram, the Corner Brook Western Star, and other newspapers. In 2004, Premier Danny Williams appointed him Provincial Representative in Ottawa, where he advised the Premier during the crucial negotiations with the Government of Canada that led to the Atlantic Accord, which secured more than two billion dollars for Newfoundland and Labrador. Rowe has written five books: Clapp’s Rock, a best-selling novel published by McClelland & Stewart of Toronto and serialized on CBC Radio; The Temptation of Victor Galanti, a second novel published by McClelland and Stewart; Is That You, Bill?, a volume of essays on politics and public affairs published by Jesperson Press of St. John's; Danny Williams: The War with Ottawa, published in 2010 by Flanker Press; and Danny Williams, Please Come Back, a compilation of his columns and commentaries, published in 2011 by Flanker Press. In 2012, Flanker Press published Rosie O'Dell, a novel whose cover featured a prominent \"Warning: Graphic Content and Mature Subject Matter.\" Rowe is a member of the Writers’ Union of Canada and has served on the executive of the Writers’ Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador. On June 22, 2011, Rowe announced on his radio show his intention to retire from VOCM after nearly thirty years to write full-time. He has agreed to fill in periodically for the regular talk show hosts. His last day as host of his show, BackTalk, was Friday, June 24, 2011. Paddy Daly took over for him on August 1, 2011. On March 8, 2013, Rowe once again took over the hosting duties at VOCM Open Line, a week after the resignation of Open Line host Randy Simms over controversial comments made on-air to Natuashish Innu Band Chief Simeon Tshakapesh.",

Grummett was the only CCF MPP to survive both the 1945 and the 1951 provincial elections, which saw most CCFers defeated, including party leader Ted Jolliffe. He was the CCF's House Leader and led the two person caucus in the legislature from 1951, following Jolliffe's defeat, until new leader Donald C. Macdonald entered the legislature in the 1955. Grummett was defeated in the 1955 general election by Ontario Progressive Conservative Party candidate Wilf Spooner, who was mayor of Timmins, Ontario, when the Liberals failed to field a candidate allowing \"old party votes\" to coalesce around Spooner. The son of a farmer in Maxwell, Ontario, just south of Collingwood, Grummett was the first lawyer in Iroquois Falls-Ansonville, having attended law school in Toronto, Ontario. He and his wife Marie raised their five children in Iroquois Falls, Ontario. He had fought in World War I as an officer in the British Army where he saw action in the Mesopotamian campaign. While there he contracted malaria which affected him for the rest of his life. He died in 1967.",

His mother's identity is not known, though one source suggests Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham. As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the American Revolution.",

The bridge was named in his honour in 1994. In the Legislative Assembly, Gilbertson served as caucus chair and chief government whip, in addition to serving on a variety of standing committees. Gilbertson died in summer 1995 on St. Joseph Island. On October 5, in one of the first sessions of the legislature following the 1995 provincial election, tributes to Gilbertson were delivered in the Assembly by Bud Wildman, Norm Sterling and Mike Brown.

  "text" : "Brian Campion is an American politician from Bennington, Vermont, in the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 2010, representing the Bennington-2-1 district in Bennington and North Bennington. He took office on January 5, 2011. Born in Albany, New York, he has attended four universities and received two degrees. He attended Springfield College (B.A., 1993), the Université Laval in Quebec, the University of Massachusetts Amherst (M.A., 2001) and the University of Provence in France. An employee of Bennington College's office of external relations, Campion is also a trustee for the Bennington Museum, a commissioner of the Bennington Housing Authority, vice-chair of the Bennington County Democrats, and a director of the Bennington Chamber of Commerce. He ran for state representative in 2010, one of three candidates seeking two seats in the Bennington-2-1 district. Both incumbent state representatives, Democrat Tim Corcoran II and Republican Joseph L. Krawczyk, Jr. were seeking re-election and had endorsed each other. In the general election held on November 2, 2010, Campion won 1,461 votes, finishing behind Corcoran's 1,965 but ahead of Krawczyk's 1,120. He was therefore elected and took office on January 5, 2011. He won re-election in 2012. Campion was elected to the Vermont Senate in 2014. Campion is openly gay; he lives in Bennington with his partner Eric Hatch. He is one of six openly gay members of the Vermont Legislature, alongside representatives Bill Lippert (D–Hinesburg), Herb Russell (D–Rutland), Matt Trieber (D–Bellows Falls) and Joanna E. Cole (D–Burlington), as well as senator Becca Balint (D–Windham).",

Hij stond in 2010 bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen namens het CDA op plaats 24 van de kandidatenlijst. Doordat het CDA een aantal ministers leverde schoof hij op, waardoor hij met een kleine onderbreking zijn Kamerlidschap kon voortzetten. Op 20 maart 2012 besloot de Tweede Kamer op zijn voorstel unaniem een parlementaire enquête in te stellen naar het stelsel van de volkshuisvesting, het beheer, het interne en externe toezicht, en de positie van de huurders bij woningcorporaties. Ook de rol van externe partijen zoals banken, toezichthouders en gemeenten wil de Tweede Kamer in de enquête betrekken. Het besluit van de Tweede Kamer vloeide voort uit de problemen bij de Vestia (woningcorporatie). Vooral werden als gevolg van de ontstane situatie bij Vestia vraagtekens geplaatst bij het toezicht op de hele sector. Sinds 1 april 2014 is hij waarnemend burgemeester van Weesp.",

He was born at Gull Lake, Saskatchewan. He was first elected in the 2012 provincial election as a member of the Wildrose Party caucus. In the spring 2013 sitting of the Alberta Legislature, Pedersen put forward Motion 510 to restore a competitive tax credit system for film industry labour costs, which was supported by the Progressive Conservatives, NDP and Liberals. Motion 510 was the first Wildrose motion to ever pass in the Alberta Legislature. The proposal in Pedersen’s motion would replace the current system of awarding grants to film companies through the Alberta Multimedia Development Fund with a tax credit that would enable all companies to recoup a portion of their production costs. Pedersen was born and raised in Gull Lake, Saskatchewan, on the family ranch. Following graduation from Gull Lake High School, he moved to Vancouver as a drummer with a band, but returned to Gull Lake a few months later and entered the work force with a local oilfield services company. Experiencing his first of many boom and bust cycles, after one year of employment Pedersen participated in a 10-month agricultural exchange program to Australia with the International Agricultural Exchange Association. Upon his return to Canada, Pedersen returned to the oilfield services industry, and in 1999 became a small business owner. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Alberta Progressive Conservative caucus. Pederson stood for reelection during the 2015 Alberta election but was defeated by NDP's Bob Wanner, finishing third.",

In 1779, they served as border guards at the Yamaska River and later became part of Edward Jessup's Loyal Rangers. In 1784, he settled in Edwardsburg Township, where he built a sawmill. In 1786, he became a justice of the peace and, in 1792, was appointed to the land board for Leeds and Grenville counties. He was also the first sheriff in the Johnstown District. He represented Dundas in the 2nd Parliament of Upper Canada and Glengarry in the 5th Parliament. During the War of 1812, he commanded companies in the militia.

McGroarty was from East End and was born on December 22, 1962. In 1983, McGroarty was elected to Wilkes-Barre City Council and served for twelve years before his election as mayor. McGroarty graduated from Coughlin High School, Luzerne County Community College and Bloomsburg University. He was both an officer and enlisted member of the 109th Field Artillery, where he served as service battery commander. McGroarty was elected mayor in 1995 and re-elected in 1999. He was the only mayor to be elected both as a Democratic and Republican, having waged a successful write in campaign as a Republican in 1995. By securing the both nominations, McGroarty enjoyed relationships with both Democratic and Republicans officials. McGroarty expanded city services in each of the city's twelve neighborhoods. But his main focus became emergency preparedness and recovery, as a result of a blizzard and significant flooding in his first month in office. McGroarty met President William J. Clinton at the White House, and hosted the President during a tour of Wilkes-Barre on February 16, 1996. During his visit, President Clinton announced federal funding for the Wyoming Valley Levee Raising Project, which provided flood protection. Long after McGroarty's departure, those same levees, enhanced on his watch, protected Wilkes-Barre in September 2011, when river levels were 42.66 feet, 1.75 feet above the flood level of Hurricane Agnes.",

  "text" : "Thomas P. Gaffey is an American politician. Gaffey, a Democrat, had been a state senator from Connecticut since 1995, but left office due to criminal violations on January 5, 2011. Gaffey, a resident of Meriden, has represented the towns of Cheshire, Meriden, Middlefield and Middletown in the Connecticut Senate. Gaffey was born in Meriden and graduated from Southern Connecticut State University. He was appointed in the fall of 2005 to serve as Chief Deputy Majority Leader by Senate Majority Leader Martin Looney and Senate President Pro Tempore Donald E. Williams, Jr., and previously served in the position. Gaffey also serves as an executive with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. In 2002, he was linked to meetings with failed energy firm Enron. He was also cited that year for spending over $10,000 in personal expenses on his authority expense account, and failing to make timely reimbursement, but later issued a CRRA check for more than $1,600 to repay amounts reimbursed in excess. In January 2009 the Hartford Courant announced state auditors were looking into other instances of improper reimbursement by Gaffey, including double billing of out of state travel to both the state government and his political action committee. On January 18, the Courant urged the State Senate to censure Gaffey for his ethical improprieties. On May 6, 2009, the State Election Enforcement Commission announced that Gaffey and his campaign treasurer had agreed to a settlement over the double billing complaint. In one of the largest fines levied by the Commission, Gaffey agreed to a $6,000 fine and his treasurer agreed to a $3,000 fine. Gaffey also agreed to dissolve his political action committee and forfeit its $20,000 balance to the state. The commission's enforcement director called Gaffey's record keeping \"disastrous\". The charges later led to a criminal investigation and Gaffey's resignation. In 2006 Gaffey supported legislation spearheaded by fellow Democrat Donald Williams intended to address childhood obesity in Connecticut. The legislation was however derided by opponents as the \"cupcake bill.\" As of August 2008, more than 63% of eligibile school districts have enrolled in the program. In March 2008 New Haven schools enforced this policy by suspending an eighth grader for selling a classmate skittles. In May 2008, a principal in Greenwich was suspended in a dispute over bringing cupcakes to school. In 2007 Gaffey proposed that the Governor's power to appoint the Commissioner of Education be limited. Allies of Governor Jodi Rell labelled the proposal an attempted power grab. That year Gaffey also opposed efforts to increase education aid to suburban school districts, even those represented by fellow Democrats, in favor of adding more funds to urban districts. His response to complaints from suburban legislators was \"Like everything else in those districts, that is rich!\" Gaffey has also clashed with leaders of his local school board over the installation of artificial turf. In November 2007 Gaffey suggested that the state had to impose a more stringent school integration plan on suburbs in the Hartford region. \"The notion that we're going to get a better result by voluntary programs is ridiculous,\" said state Sen. Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden, co-chairman of the legislature's education committee. \"We need to shift away from the model of remedy that the state has been pursuing for years. The district is as racially isolated today as it was 10 years ago. It suggests you need to do something different.\" Another Gaffey initiative was a bill that banned most out-of-school suspensions. Educators were unsure how they could comply with the law. In 2008 Gaffey did break with party leadership to support a Three Strikes Law to give life sentences to career violent criminals supported by Governor M. Jodi Rell. Thomas P. Gaffey was the father of three children. His son, Thomas M. Gaffey died on February 2, 2009, at the age of 16. In 2005 the Connecticut Appellate Court denied the Senator's ex-wife's request for increased child support.",

He came to Cranbrook around 1898 upon the completion of the Crowsnest Pass line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Caven was an employee of the Canadian Pacific Railway, a longtime railway conductor. A 1903 article stated that his property interests were largely a part of his money earned as a railway employee, noting that he \"[represented] the people that have made Cranbrook one of the flourishing and progressive towns of the province.\" In the British Columbia general election, 1903, he obtained the Conservative nomination for the provincial electoral district of Cranbrook, but he would ultimately lose out to Liberal James Horace King. After another defeat in 1907, Caven would eventually head to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, elected in 1909 and again, this time by acclamation in 1912. His term ended in 1916 when he was defeated again by James H. King. He attempted a return in 1920 as an Independent Conservative but he was defeated by King once again. He retired from the railway in 1923. In November 1906, Caven married Elizabeth Dickerson of Emporium, Pennsylvania. He was an active member of the freemasons, taking part in the Cranbrook Masonic Lodge, Royal Arch Masons and Seklirk Preceptory. Thomas Caven died suddenly February 20, 1926 at Vancouver. A newspaper report noted the \"profound shock\" that his death sent across the East Kootenay region, as it was not known that he was in ill health at the time.",

  "text" : "Robert Law McCartney, QC (born 24 April 1936) is a Northern Irish barrister and a former leader of the UK Unionist Party. He was initially a member of the Ulster Unionist Party but was expelled in June 1987 when he refused to withdraw from the general election of that year. He stood against the incumbent Popular Unionist Party MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a \"Real Unionist\" but failed to win the seat. In the 1995 by-election in North Down after the death of Kilfedder he was elected as a \"UK Unionist\" defeating the Ulster Unionist Party candidate. He subsequently established the United Kingdom Unionist Party to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum and the related talks which startedin 1996. The other party representatives to the Forum were Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien and Cedric Wilson, a former low-level DUP member in the 1980s. McCartney retained his Westminster seat in the 1997 election. He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson East Antrim). However, Wilson, Roche, Boyd and Hutchinson parted company with McCartney in December 1998 because of their leader's so-called 'exit strategy' from the Northern Ireland Assembly in the event of Sinn Féin being allowed seats in the new Northern Ireland Government. McCartney denounced them, saying all four 'were famous in their own living rooms' and that their supporters 'could fit into a telephone box.' In 2008 both Wilson and Boyd attended meetings of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice. In 1999, Robert McCartney ran for the party in elections to the European Parliament, winning 2.9% of the first preference vote. He lost his Westminster seat in the 2001 election to the UUP candidate Lady Hermon. He was committed to a policy of integration for Northern Ireland, whereby legislative devolution for Northern Ireland would no longer be Westminster's abiding policy, there would be no Stormont legislative assembly and the province would be a fully participating part of the United Kingdom; at the same time the three main British political parties would fully organise in Northern Ireland. He was the president of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1986, and led it in its four years of prominence after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. McCartney resigned as head of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1988 over a dispute with its executive. These integrationist policies, once popular in some sections of Unionism, receded with the introduction of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and the creation of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. However it is the case that other parts of the United Kingdom with devolved assemblies are fully covered by the three main British political parties, but not in Northern Ireland. McCartney also strongly opposed the St Andrews Agreement and in 2007 stood on an anti-agreement ticket in six different constituencies. He lost his own seat in North Down, polling 1,806 first preference votes (5.9% of the total, and less than half the quota required to be elected). He also obtained 360 votes (1.2%) in Belfast North, 388 votes (0.8%) in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 853 votes (2.0%) in Lagan Valley, 893 votes (2.3%) in South Antrim and 220 votes (0.5%) in West Tyrone He claims to have retired from politics following the loss of his seat in the 2007 Assembly Election to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. However, he still occasionally makes media appearances and writes newspaper articles and in October 2009, Robert McCartney was guest speaker at the Traditional Unionist Voice party conference in Belfast, where he spoke on the situation surrounding the primary school transfer test, brought about by a Sinn Féin Education Minister.",

He complained of the \"Blatant promotion of opposing points of view\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston after seeing that Derek Warfield had a radio channel dedicated to his music. Beggs, it was the same as \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights stating: \"It is something that should not have been on board and we removed it immediately we became aware of it.\"",

  "text" : "Richard Arthur Miller (July 23, 1960 – October 26, 2013) was born in Burns Lake, British Columbia. He was a politician in the Canadian province of Alberta and former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. He was elected on November 22, 2004 in the 26th Alberta general election in Edmonton Rutherford, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative and former member of the Canadian House of Commons Ian McClelland. Miller served as opposition critic for two portfolios, the Treasury Board and Finance. He was also the chief opposition whip for the Alberta Liberal Party. He was defeated in the 2008 election by Progressive Conservative Fred Horne. In May 2005, Miller involved himself in the controversy surrounding the decision of then Conservative Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberals. After Tony Abbott, a fellow Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, made remarks comparing Stronach to a prostitute, Miller spoke out on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, condemning Abbott's remarks. After his speech, Abbott reportedly attempted to assault Miller in the corridor behind the Chamber. Due to a security guard's intervention, a major confrontation was prevented. This matter was resolved when Abbott apologized publicly for any perceived wrongs. Though Edmonton-Rutherford was perceived as an Alberta Liberal stronghold since the 1989 provincial election (in which Liberal MLA Percy Wickman defeated Premier Don Getty in his own riding), Rick Miller lost by 58 votes to PC candidate Fred Horne in 2008; this margin widened in the 2012 election. On October 26, 2013, Rick Miller died of prostate cancer in Edmonton, he was survived by his wife and two children.",

While in office, Brawley was elected the President of the National Republican Legislators Association and was named National Legislator of the Year in 1995. Brawley ran for North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance in 2004, losing to James E. Long. In 2012, Brawley was again elected to the House from the Iredell County-based 95th district. He won the May 8 Republican primary, which was tantamount to election, since no Democrat filed for the seat. Meanwhile, Brawley was also in 2012 named to lead the North Carolina chapter of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. In April 2013, Brawley filed House Bill 640 that would allow lobbyists to give unreported gifts to state lawmakers in North Carolina. In May 2013, Brawley resigned as chairman of the House Finance Committee in a dispute with House Speaker Thom Tillis. Brawley lost his bid for another term in the May 2014 Republican primary, with some of his colleagues in the House campaigning against him. Afterwards, the House Republican Caucus passed a vote of \"no confidence\" in Brawley, effectively barring him from caucus meetings. Brawley suggested that the censure was in retaliation for his criticism of Tillis. On December 9, 2015, Brawley announced his candidacy for the office of Governor of North Carolina, challenging current governor Pat McCrory.",

  "text" : "李燦明（Richard T. Lee，1954年－)，加拿大華裔，現任卑詩省省議會代表北本拿比的省議員（2001年至今），為該區首名華裔省議員。 李燦明生於廣東省中山市恆美村，祖父於1913年支付500加拿大元人頭稅前往加拿大，後因加拿大推行《1923年華人移民法》（當地華人又稱《排華法》）與家人分隔兩地，而李燦明則於1959年五歲時隨家人移居香港，其後再移居澳門。《排華法》於1947年取消後，李燦明於1971年與家人移民加拿大卑詩省大温地區與祖父團聚。 他於1972年升讀卑詩大學數學物理系，取得學士學位後在該校攻讀應用數學科學碩士學位，畢業後留在該校從事科研工作，並曾任職程序分析師，與妻子育有三名子女。李燦明於1990年代初投入社區事務，參加家長會、卑詩族裔語言協會和溫哥華支援民主運動聯合會等組織，並擔任保釣大聯盟的召集人，在1996年組織保釣大遊行。 他於1993年加入卑詩自由黨，並於1996年在北本拿比選區首度參與省議會選舉，但不敵新民主黨候選人卡倫蒂諾（Pietro Calendino）。到了2001年省選，在新民主黨民望低企的情況下，李燦明在該選區與卡倫蒂諾再度交鋒時成功贏取該議席，首度晉身議事廳。2005年第二次參選再次勝利，獲得連任。在2005年6月16日被卑詩省長金寶爾委派擔任當屆省議會的亞太事務部秘書長（Asia-Pacific Initiative）一職。 2009年和2013年省選李燦明先後參選，並再度連任。",

He entered provincial politics in 1997 when he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. Raj became leader in February 2000 after the previous leader, Pam Barrett, retired from politics. Pannu ran a high-profile campaign in the 2001 Alberta election. T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Raj Against the Machine\", as well as a reputation as a \"likeable and honest politician\" contributed to his popularity and made him a leader well respected by supporters and non-supporters alike. He announced on July 13, 2004 that he was resigning as party leader. Fellow MLA Brian Mason, the deputy leader, became interim leader. Mason was formally elected leader in a leadership convention held on September 18. However, he sought re-election as an MLA in the 26th Alberta general election, and was re-elected by a wide margin. On June 14, 2006, he announced his retirement from Alberta politics at the dissolution of the legislature, which took place in February 2008.",

While his party formed a majority government, Howard was not included in Gordon Campbell's cabinet but was appointed to several committees, including the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts in the first two sessions, and Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services in the third and fourth session.

As chair of the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, Howard supported Premier Campbell's efforts at establishing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Following Campbell's resignation, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon but Christy Clark won the leadership election. Clark eventually made Howard a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Transportation. In this position he advocated for Open Sky agreements and continued this advocacy in his post-political life by establishing the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada. Howard did not seek re-election during the 2013 provincial election and was replaced by BC Liberal Teresa Wat. Prior to his election to the legislature, Howard worked in property management.

He is a member of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party. One of 5 boys, Brothers - Don, was a pilot and shot down in WWII, John Fiske, Fred Fiske, Leon Fiske, (and 2 sisters who died at birth), Fiske was born in Clarence, Nova Scotia and graduated from high school in Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Growing up on a wood mill run by his father, he began his business career working in the bank. Later to become an entrepreneur, businessman, restaurateur, and motel/hotel owner/operator. He married Claire Longley of Bridgetown, Nova Scotia and has three children, Heather, Alan and Shari. Fiske entered provincial politics in the 1970 election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Donald R. MacLeod by 434 votes in Pictou Centre. On October 28, 1970, Fiske was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Trade and Industry. On July 15, 1971, Gerald Regan shuffled his cabinet, moving Fiske to Minister of Development. He remained as Provincial Secretary until another shuffle in November 1971. Fiske resigned from cabinet prior to an August 1973 cabinet shuffle, and did not seek re-election in 1974. He later served as Chairman of the Nova Scotia Gaming Commission. Although forced to resign due to indiscretions between the Halifax Casino and the government at the time, his claims were found to be truthful. \"When Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation's former chairman Ralph Fiske's wrongful dismissal suit went to trial last May, one canny Halifax lawyer voiced surprise that Fiske planned to call only two witnesses: himself and former finance minister Bill Gillis. Arrayed against him were seventeen members of Nova Scotia's political, bureaucratic, and legal establishment: former premiers, cabinet ministers, and deputy ministers from the premier's office; officials of the gaming corporation; and a clutch of Liberal lawyers from the province's best-connected law firms. Yesterday, Fiske touched home plate in near total victory. Gruchy found that political interference in the gaming corporation's administration of the Sheraton Casino project rendered Fiske's position untenable and forced him to resign. Nova Scotian's should celebrate this moment, rare in our recent history, when a lone civil servant proved that courage and integrity can overcome the mediocrity that corrupts governance in this province. When future civil servants are forced to choose between doing the right thing and the politically easy thing, Fiske's example will beckon them toward duty\"",

Events such as ordering all Canadian flags to be removed from provincial government buildings, and launching the Anything But Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election, garnered national attention.

Ikeda is the founding president of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), the world's largest Buddhist lay organization, with approximately 12 million practitioners in 192 countries and regions. Ikeda was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1928, to a family of seaweed farmers. He survived the devastation of World War II as a teenager, which he said left an indelible mark on his life and fueled his quest to solve the fundamental causes of human conflict. At age 19, Ikeda began practicing Nichiren Buddhism and joined a youth group of the Soka Gakkai Buddhist association, which led to his lifelong work developing the global peace movement of SGI and founding numerous institutions dedicated to fostering peace, culture and education. Ikeda's vision for the SGI has been described by academic observers as a \"borderless Buddhist humanism that emphasizes free thinking and personal development based on respect for all life.\" In the 1960s, Ikeda worked to reopen Japan's relationship with China, to establish the Soka education network of humanistic schools from kindergartens through universities, and he began writing The Human Revolution. In the 1970s, he established the Soka Gakkai International and initiated numerous international educational and cultural exchanges for peace. Since the 1980s, he has continually increased his anti-nuclear activism and citizen diplomacy. As of 2015, Ikeda has published more than 50 dialogues with scholars, peace activists and leading world figures. In his role as SGI president, Ikeda has visited 55 nations and spoken on subjects including peace, environment, economics, women's rights, interfaith dialogue, nuclear disarmament, Buddhism and science, and various other topics. Every year on the anniversary of the SGI's founding, January 26, Ikeda submits a peace proposal to the United Nations.",

  "text" : "Donald J. Atchison is a Canadian politician who was elected mayor of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on October 22, 2003. He won a close four-way contest, running on a platform that included being tough on crime, freezing property taxes, and resuming control of the city's police commission. He was re-elected as mayor in 2006, 2009 and 2012. At the end of his current term in 2016, he will become the longest-serving mayor in Saskatoon's history at 13 years. Prior to being mayor, Atchison was first elected to Saskatoon's city council as a councillor for Ward 10 in 1994, and was re-elected in 1997 and 2000. As a city councillor, Atchison suggested a part of downtown Saskatoon should be enclosed by a $80 million 10-storey climate-controlled glass atrium, dubbed the \"Atreos.\" He also is known to be precise about his dress, as he owns a men's clothing store. On his first election as mayor, he required citizens visiting the Mayor's office to be formally dressed, a policy that was soon dropped after being criticized. Both points were ridiculed by CBC satirist Rick Mercer who sponsored an online contest that went on to name Atchison \"Canada's Craziest Mayor.\"",

He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo.",

He obtained an undergraduate and graduate degree from the University of British Columbia in political science and public administration, returning to the Williams Lake area, where he became a cattle rancher and a practitioner of horse logging. He was also active as a consultant in various federal, provincial, and First Nations projects related to public policy and economic development. Zirnhelt began his political career when he served as a director of the Cariboo Regional District from 1974 to 1977. In 1987, he was elected as a trustee of the Cariboo-Chilcotin School District. Zirnhelt made the leap to provincial politics in 1989, winning the seat of Cariboo in a by-election for the social democratic British Columbia New Democratic Party. The riding had, until then, been a stronghold of the conservative British Columbia Social Credit Party for almost forty years. Zirnhelt would go on to be re-elected in 1991 and 1996 in the riding of Cariboo South (the old Cariboo riding was abolished with the 1991 election). With the election of a New Democratic government in 1991, Premier Mike Harcourt appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Economic Development, Small Business and Trade. He later served as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. Following Harcourt's resignation, Premier Glen Clark appointed Zirnhelt Minister of Forests — a powerful portfolio in a province where forestry is a major economic sector. In that position, Zirnhelt initiated an intensive review of the province's forest practices, as concerns mounted over the logging of old growth forests and the insufficient restocking of logged areas by timber companies. Zirnhelt failed in his attempt at re-election in 2001.",

Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens.",

He was first elected at the Cape Breton South riding in the 1957 general election, defeating the long-serving incumbent Co-operative Commonwealth Federation member of parliament Clarence Gillis, also a former miner. MacInnis defeated Gillis again in a rematch almost a year later in the 1958 general election, known as the \"Diefenbaker Sweep.\" MacInnis remained a Member of Parliament throughout the 1960s and early 1970s except for the 25th Parliament when he was defeated in the riding by Malcolm Vic MacInnis of the New Democratic Party in the 1962 election. Since the 1968 election, MacInnis represented Cape Breton—East Richmond, one of the ridings which replaced the Cape Breton South electoral district in a boundary realignment. After his term in the 29th Parliament ended in 1974, MacInnis left national office and did not campaign for another term.

Her Republican and Independent opponents took 31% and 16% of the vote respectively. Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Ruggiero went to high school in Lincoln, Rhode Island before attending Boston College, graduating magna cum laude with a double major in English and Communications. She has spent her career in the media, working first for CBS radio in Boston, then for FOX TV and WPRI-TV for 8 years. Since 2000, she has served as Director of Community and Business Development at Citadel Radio, the owners of WPRO and WPRO-FM. Since 1992, she has also taught a class in Broadcast Advertising at Providence College. A supporter of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Ruggiero attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver as an alternate.

She first won election to the House of Representatives in 1978, and served in the body until 1998. Long was elected as the first female Speaker of the House in 1992. Her tenure in that position was cut short due to the \"Phonegate\" scandal, in which members of the House of Representatives were found to be using state toll-free access codes for personal use. Long resigned the speakership in September 1993, but continued to serve until 1998, becoming the first woman to chair the House Tax Committee.

  "text" : "Daniel C. Itse, known as Dan Itse (born May 21, 1958), is a conservative Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. A native of San Francisco, California, Itse is a professional engineer who resides in Fremont, New Hampshire. He advocates the revival of state sovereignty in an era of otherwise expanded government through the revival of the 1798 Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, respectively, to permit the empowerment of individual states within the federal Union. Itse has explained his proposition on the national Glenn Beck interview program on Fox news. Itse's resolution in the New Hampshire legislature inspired other state legislatures to do the same (possibly as many as 20.) When he was eight years old, Itse moved with his family to Sherborn, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1976 from Dover-Sherborn High School. and then enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, from which in 1980 he procured a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering. He earned a master of science in the same field in 1986, also from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He is a registered professional engineer in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. From 1979-1989, he worked for the Riley Stoker Corporation. He was chief engineer of Physical Sciences, Inc., from 1989-1994. Since 1994, he has owned Christofferson Engineering. An inventor, Itse holds patents on (1) a low-emissions burner for coal-fired power plants, (2) a low-emissions combustion system for waste-to-energy, (3) a process for disposing of heavy metals, and (4) a device to enhance the injection of chemicals for reducing pollution from power plants. In 2009, Itse was working on the air pollution control system for the largest wood-fired power plant in North America. Since 2001, Itse has represented Rockingham County, which is located in the southeastern corner of the state, in the legislature, which meets in the capital city of Concord. He has served on the Children and Family Law and the Science, Technology and Energy committees. He once had the best attendance record in the legislature. He claims to vote in all cases in accordance with a literal reading of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, and personal liberty and property. In the 2011/2012 term he was the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification. In that term he saw the creation of the Committee on Redress of Grievances Chaired by Rep. Paul Ingbretson. The peoples right of redress as a positive right in New Hampshire was brought to light as a result of his commentary on the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire, \"The People's Liberty\". An advocate of judicial reform, Itse supports constitutional amendments regarding the recognition of marriage, parental rights, prohibiting a state income tax, and affirming the right to petition the legislature for redress of grievances. He is a nationally prominent advocate of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the assertion of state sovereignty.Though his sovereignty amendment was rejected by his New Hampshire colleagues, it inspired similar proposals in some twenty states as well as the \"Tea Party\" demonstrations in April 2009. In 1979, while he was a senior in college, Itse married the former Lisa Mullins. The couple has five children, born between 1983 and 1995. The youngest, Jarrod, is handicapped. In the 2008 Republican presidential contest, Itse was a supporter of U.S. Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado. Itse is scheduled to address the national committee meeting of the Constitution Party to be held June 11–13 in Newark, New Jersey. In 2014 Itse authored \"States Have Powers - the Powers of the People, use 'em or lose 'em\" (available on Amazon). The book is an expository on his 2012 sovereignty resolution. It explains why the People are in fact in supreme power in America, and the intended distribution of power between the government of the United States and the States and between the three branches of government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial. At their 2015 Liberty Dinner, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance revealed that Itse was chosen as legislator of the year.",

Andrews earned a bachelor's degree from UMass Amherst and an MBA from Xavier University before embarking on a 25-year career with Procter & Gamble (P&G).

She left P&G in 2006 after four years as the company's global diversity & inclusion manager. She then established her own consulting business, Legacy Unlimited. Following incumbent state representative Chris Donelan's announcement that he would run for Franklin County sheriff rather than seek re-election in 2010, Andrews launched a bid to succeed him in the state house. In the Democratic primary election held on September 14, 2010, Andrews polled 37% in a five candidate race, finishing 519 votes ahead of the second-place finisher, who took 24%. In the general election held on November 2, she polled 6,885 (53%), finishing over 1,300 votes ahead of the Republican nominee (who took 42%) and an independent (on 5%). She first took office on January 5, 2011. She was defeated for re-election by Republican Susannah Whipps Lee in November 2014; her term will end January 7, 2015.",

Later, O'Connor travelled north where he founded the town of Temagami and opened Lady Evelyn Hotel, the Temagami Inn and Ronnoco Hotel. When O'Connor moved to Temagami, he was hoping to find some mineral prospects. In 1899, O'Connor created test pits in east-central Strathy Township that later became Big Dan Mine, which is named after him. Other mines in Temagami that bare his name are Little Dan at Arsenic Lake and O'Connor near Lake Temagami. O'Connor continued to move northwards where he discovered deposits of gold. On March 30, 1933, O'Connor died in the city of Timmins where he was living with his family. The cause of his death was bronchopneumonia.",

Im Mai 1968 wurde er prominenter Sprecher der Studenten in Paris. Nach seiner Ausweisung aus Frankreich war er im Sozialistischen Deutschen Studentenbund (SDS) und der APO aktiv. In den 1970er Jahren gehörte er zur Sponti-Szene in Frankfurt am Main und gab das Stadtmagazin Pflasterstrand heraus. Ab 1978 engagierte er sich für die damals entstehende Partei der Grünen und entwickelte sich dort mit Joschka Fischer zu einem Vertreter des „Realo“-Flügels. 1989 bis 1997 war er der erste Dezernent des neu eingerichteten Amts für multi-kulturelle Angelegenheiten in Frankfurt am Main. Von 1994 bis 2014 war er Mitglied im Europäischen Parlament. Ab 2002 war er dort Co-Vorsitzender der Fraktion der Grünen / Europäische Freie Allianz. Er kandidierte abwechselnd für die deutschen Grünen und die französischen Les Verts bzw. Europe Écologie-Les Verts. Zur Europawahl 2014 zog sich Cohn-Bendit aus der aktiven Politik zurück. Er begründete dies mit der gesundheitlichen Belastung, werde aber weiterhin „demonstrieren gehen“. Cohn-Bendit schrieb zahlreiche politische Aufsätze und Bücher und moderiert verschiedene Fernsehsendungen. Er wohnt in Frankfurt am Main, ist seit 1997 mit seiner langjährigen Partnerin Ingrid Apel verheiratet. Er hat mit ihr einen Sohn und zog Ingrids Sohn Niko Apel mit auf.",

  "text" : "Dorothy Mary Wyatt, née Fanning (1925 - 2001) was a Canadian politician, who served as mayor of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from 1973 to 1981. She was the city's first female mayor. Wyatt first worked as a secretary, meeting her husband Donald Wyatt while working for American Overseas Airlines in Gander. She later returned to Memorial University of Newfoundland to study nursing. Wyatt first won election to St. John's City Council in 1969 as the city's first female alderman. She ran for the mayoralty in 1973, winning the election and serving two terms in office. Her term as mayor was marked by accomplishments including the city's hosting of the Canada Summer Games in 1977, a shift from rental-value to capital-value municipal tax assessment, the adoption of a ward system for city council elections, and the construction of many of the city's modern office buildings. Wyatt was defeated by John Joseph Murphy in the 1981 election. She was later reelected as a councillor at large in 1985, and remained a sitting member of city council until her death; she died just two days before the city's 2001 municipal election, and was posthumously reelected to her seat on September 25.

After the independence of Federation of Malaya from the British Empire on 31 August 1957 and later the Formation of Malaysia in 1963, Kuala Lumpur became the capital of Malaysia. Today, there is a street named after him in the heart of Chinatown in Kuala Lumpur, known as \"Jalan Yap Ah Loy\" or \"Yap Ah Loy Road\".",

His most notable duty was as commander of the Snowbirds Air Demonstration Team - 431 Squadron. In 1986, he was made an Officer of the Order of Military Merit. In 1997, he ran for the leadership of the fledgling Saskatchewan Party. He finished 3rd among three candidates. In 1999, in his first run at public office, he narrowly lost election in the Wood River constituency as the Saskatchewan Party candidate. On election night, he tied Liberal candidate Glen McPherson. The returning officer cast the deciding vote in favour of McPherson. This result was later thrown out in court and a by-election was ordered. McPherson did not run and Huyghebaert then won a resounding victory. He was re-elected in 2003. On May 29, 2009, Huyghebaert was appointed to cabinet by Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall in the role of minister of Corrections, Public Safety and Policing.",

Kapitans were appointed chiefs or headmen of the various ethnic communities during the British colonial rule in what is present-day Malaysia. Kapitans played an important role in the history of the Chinese in Malaysia. They wielded considerable influence, contributing to social, economic and political development in areas under their jurisdiction. Yap Kwan Seng, of Hakka descent, was born in 1846 in the Chak Kai district of China. He moved to Malaya at the age of 18 and worked as a tin miner in Seremban. On his death, The Straits Times carried the following obituary: TOWKAY Yap Kwan Seng, the Captain China of Selangor, died at Kuala Lumpur on Friday, of consumption, at the age of fifty-five years, of which he had spent forty in the Straits. He came from the Canton province and had resided thirty-two years in Selangor. He had held the post of Captain China there since 1889. The deceased was popular among all classes and was a liberal giver to charities. He was a Trustee of the Victoria Institution to whose funds he liberally subscribed. He gave $10,000 to the Transvaal War Fund and also a handsome donation to St. Mary's Church building fund. He was always a good friend to his poorer countrymen, for whom he established a practically free dispensary. During the Pahang rebellion he rendered much assistance to the Government and was thanked for his services. He leaves behind him five wives here and three in China, also a large family consisting of fifteen sons and ten daughters.",

  "text" : "Helen Mamayaok Maksagak, CM (April 15, 1931 – January 23, 2009) was a Canadian politician. She served as the Commissioner of the Northwest Territories (Canada) from January 16, 1995 until March 26, 1999 and as the Commissioner of Nunavut from April 1, 1999 until April 1, 2000. She is a notable Copper Inuk. Born on the land near Bernard Harbour in the Canadian Western Arctic, Maksagak was raised in Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik and the Bathurst Inlet area and eventually settled in Cambridge Bay to raise a family of six surviving children with her husband John Sr. Together they were stalwart supporters of the growing indigenous rights movement in the Canadian north. Their home was often a stopping place and site of discussions when young Inuit involved in negotiating the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or participating in Northwest Territories political life passed through the community. Maksagak was appointed as Deputy Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in 1992. In 1995, she was appointed as Commissioner, partially in anticipation of the pending creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999. She was the first woman and first Inuk to hold the office. In April 1999 she transferred with her office to the new Nunavut Territory and continued to provide stability to the new government in transition. She served until April 2000 as the first commissioner of the newly created territory of Nunavut and then as Assistant Commissioner of Nunavut from 2005 until her death in 2009. Helen Maksagak was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada in May, 2003. She served as a member of the Qulliit (Nunavut) Status of Women Council and as an Elder for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. Maksagak died on January 23, 2009 at the age of 77. Helen Maksagak Drive in Iqaluit is named in her memory.",

He received his B.A. degree from Loyola College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1920. While in school, O'Conor was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun from 1919 to 1920. On November 24, 1920, O'Conor married Mary Eugenia Byrnes (1896–1971) and they had five children, Herbert R. Jr., Eugene F., James Patrick, Robert and Mary Patricia. From 1921 to 1922, O'Conor served as the assistant state's attorney for Baltimore. In 1923, he was elected State's Attorney of Baltimore City, and served there until he was elected as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1934. O'Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner SS Morro Castle in 1934. O'Conor identified her body which was found face under close to the wreck site. O'Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O'Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor's Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943. Near the end of World War II, O'Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system. O'Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, Hughes served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery.",

Harry Nice was born in Washington D.C., but was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He later attended Baltimore City College, Dickinson College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1899. He was married to Edna Viola Amos in 1905, with whom he had two sons, Harry Jr, and William, who died in childhood. Nice served as assistant to the State's Attorney in Baltimore, but later resigned to run for the Republican nomination for governor of Maryland in 1919. He lost to Democrat Albert C. Ritchie by a narrow margin. Following the defeat, Nice accepted a position in the Appeals Tax Court of Baltimore City as a judge from 1920 until 1924. In 1934, running under the campaign motto of \"Right the wrong of 1919\", Nice again challenged Ritchie and defeated him by 6,149 votes. Nice rose to become governor during the national depression, which brought great financial hardships to the state budget. To help find a solution to the situation, Nice assigned a committee to investigate ways of alleviating the debt, but was not pleased with the recommendations of raising taxes. Neither he nor the Maryland General Assembly felt it would be wise to raise taxes at such a rate. Also as governor, Nice redesigned the governors' residence at Government House, changing the architectural style from Victorian to Georgian. After losing the support of his party, Nice was defeated by Herbert R. O'Conor in 1938. He attempted to run for the U.S. Senate in 1940, but was unsuccessful and resumed his law practice in Baltimore. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery.",

  "text" : "Hilbrand Pier Anne Nawijn (born August 8, 1948) is a Dutch politician of the Party for the Netherlands (PVN). He was Minister for Integration & Immigration from July 22, 2002 until May 27, 2003 and later a Member of the House of Representatives for the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF). Nawijn was born in Kampen. The son of a burgemeester (mayor), he is a descendant of Firmin Navin, a French Huguenot who had fled to Holland in 1696 to escape persecution. After graduating Emelwerda College in Emmeloord he studied law at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. Following a long career working for the Dutch Ministry of Justice he was elected in 2002 as a member of the Christen-Democratisch Appèl for the city council of Zoetermeer. Nawijn was an early supporter of the openly gay, populist Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn and in 2002, when Fortuyn founded the Pim Fortuyn List, Nawijn earned a place on the list. Despite the assassination of Fortuyn by an animal rights activist, which happened days before the election, the LPF emerged with a successful result, thus bringing Nawijn into the Dutch House of Representatives. He was appointed Minister for Integration and Immigration in the first Balkenende cabinet. Due to the instability of the LPF following Fortuyn's assassination, the first Balkenende cabinet lasted briefly, leading to early elections in 2003. Due to Nawijn's controversial conservative positions such as his support of the death penalty, which horrified many people in the Netherlands, he was placed at the bottom of the LPF's electoral list. This should have made it almost impossible for Nawijn to be reelected, however, the same statements which made him so unpopular to the political establishment won him a following among voters. On election day Nawijn received enough individual votes to once again enter the House of Representatives. Despite still being a member of the LPF, Nawijn often was at odds with the party. In January 2005, he left the fragmented LPF with the goal of founding his own political party which conceptually would lean closer towards the ideas of the far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang. Together with one of the leaders of Vlaams Belang, Filip Dewinter, in June 2005 he announced the founding of a think tank during a controversial meeting in the former house of murdered politician Pim Fortuyn. Marten Fortuyn, Pim Fortuyn's brother, called this action provocative, and \"I had expected otherwise from Nawijn.\" The influential Dutch magazine Elsevier writes: \"According to (the LPF member of parliament) Varela, it was widely known that Pim Fortuyn wanted nothing to do with Dewinter, who's party Vlaams Blok (resurrected as Vlaams Belang) had the previous year been forbidden due to racism.\" In the Dutch municipal elections of 2006, Nawijn managed, with his own new party, to gather 5 out of 39 seats in his hometown Zoetermeer. Later that year he entered the 2006 Dutch elections with a new party, the Partij voor Nederland (Party for the Netherlands), but obtained no seats. During his campaign, Nawijn voiced his support for accepting CIA black sites into the Netherlands in an interview in October 2006 in the Dutch newspaper Spits. In early 2007, Nawijn participated in the Dutch version of So You Wanna Be a Popstar?, broadcast by the Dutch commercial TV channel SBS6, granting him fulfilment of one of his dreams. He stated that \"Now that I have left national politics, I can do such things. An additional advantage is that it will keep me a bit 'in the picture'\". As a result of his performances at the talent contest, which were met with public ridicule, Nawijn signed up for a five-year contract as a singer. His first single came out in May 2007, Hey Jumpen, in the jumpstyle genre, and reached #45 in the Dutch Single Top 100 charts. In February 2008 he returned to his original career in law.",

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014.",

  "text" : "Osbeorn (died c. 1054), given the nickname Bulax, was the son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria (died 1055). He is one of two known sons — probably the older — of Siward. While it is normally assumed he was the son of Siward's Bamburgh wife Ælfflæd, it has been suggested by William Kapelle that Osbeorn's mother was not Ælfflæd. The nickname \"Bulax\" probably represents the Old Norse term for \"Poleaxe\". According to the most reliable sources, he died at the Battle of the Seven Sleepers, fought somewhere in Scotland between Siward and Mac Bethad mac Findlaích, King of the Scots, in 1054. Under this year, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recension D, related that: \"At this time earl Siward went with a great army into Scotland, with both fleet and a land-force; and fought against the Scots, and put to flight the king Mac Bethad, and slew all that were best in the land, and brought thence much war-spoil, such as no man obtained before;   And there were slain his son Osbeorn, and his sister's son Siward, and some of his housecarls, and also of the king's, on the day of the Seven Sleepers (July 27).\"   This battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the Firth of Forth, and is known variously as the \"Battle of the Seven Sleepers\" or the \"Battle of Dunsinane\". The location Dunsinane is not accepted as historical by modern historians, resting as it does on later medieval accounts. The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle being the early 15th-century account by Andrew of Wyntoun. In recension C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the names of the slain are omitted, an omission repeated by the Chronicle of John of Worcester. Henry of Huntingdon related that Osbeorn had been sent to Scotland ahead of Siward:\"[Siward] sent his son to acquire Scotland. And when they reported to his father that he had been slain in battle, [Siward] said, 'Did he receive the mortal wound in front of his body, or behind?' The messengers said. 'In front'. And he replied: 'I rejoice wholly, for I would deem myself or my son worthy of no meaner death'. Siward therefore marched into Scotland and conquered the king battle ... \" Another legendary account, in the Vita et Passio Waldevi, a hagiography of Osbeorn's brother Waltheof, claimed that Osbeorn, called \"Osbert Bulax\", was killed by Northumbrians while his father was absent in Scotland. The accounts in Henry of Huntingdon and the Vita et Passio Waldevi are thought to be derived from a saga devoted to the life of Earl Siward. Geoffrey Gaimar's account related activity in 1053, an agreement made between Siward and Mac Bethad, but a death of Osbeorn is not mentioned. Osbeorn's death left Siward's legacy in danger. When he died the following year, his only son Waltheof was underage and thus did not succeed immediately to the whole territory ruled by Siward, Northumbria going instead to Tostig Godwinson.",

  "text" : "Sadiq Ali (May 2, 1952 – April 18, 2011) was a senior politician of Kashmir, India, a noted poet and writer and an active environmentalist. He was an elected legislator in the Kashmir State Assembly for three consecutive terms. Mr Sadiq Ali was born in Srinagar into an influential business family. His father, the late Mr. Jaffer Ali was a Paper mache artist and businessman. Sadiq Ali graduated from Aligarh Muslim University and earned his MA in Political Science. He has given some important recommendations about the solution of the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. His self-rule report has been widely applauded in both India and Pakistan and his recommendations have been regarded as one of the most workable solutions of this issue. He has also written a comprehensive paper on the deteriorating conditions of the forests of Jammu and Kashmir State; he has further submitted an indepth research paper outlining how the Dal Lake may be saved from further degradation. Mr Sadiq Ali entered politics at a very young age, and was one of the closest associates of Sheikh Abdullah, the founder of National Conference. He was nominated to the State Legislative Council numerous times. He also held the position of treasurer of the JKNC for 23 years. He quit National Conference stating personal reasons, although he never spoke against the NC party or its principles. There was widespread speculation that the only reason Mr Sadiq Ali quit NC was because of the NC leadership's inadequate action against a rival from within NC, whom Mr Sadiq had accused of sabotaging his re-election bid from Zadibal. On March 9, 2008, Farooq Abdullah, the patron of NC, announced to the media that Mr Sadiq Ali had rejoined the party and would be handling the state affairs of the party.",

Estudió en la escuela hasta 10º curso, para unirse con solo 13 años al movimiento independentista indio, pues se vio atraído por las ideas de Manabendranath Roy a muy corta edad. En 1942 se unió al movimiento Quit India, por lo que fue detenido y encarcelado, pasando tres años en prisión. Durante su estancia en la cárcel comenzó a estudiar a los clásicos del marxismo. En 1948, junto a otros colegas como Nihar Mukherjee (que le sucedería en el puesto tras su muerte), decide fundar el SUCI(C). Murió en Bengala el día que cumplía 53 años, en 1976",

She was born in Boon Lake, Minnesota, the daughter of local politician Bowman C. McEwen and the granddaughter of Minnesota Representative Charles D. McEwen. Trained as a schoolteacher, she married Max Ramsland, the son of Minnesota politician Ole Ramsland, in Buffalo Lake, Minnesota in 1906 and moved to Saskatchewan, settling first in Canora and later in Buchanan and Kamsack. Max Ramsland was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 1917 provincial election as the Liberal MLA for Pelly, but died in 1918 in the Spanish flu epidemic, and Sarah Ramsland was elected to succeed him in the resulting byelection. Early in her term she was invited by Premier William Melville Martin to second the formal motion to accept a Speech from the Throne, but declined the honour. Ramsland was reelected in the 1921 election, and served until 1925. A backbench MLA, she rarely spoke in the legislature and was not prominent in the government until her final day in the legislature, when she introduced a resolution calling for an amendment to federal divorce laws that would permit women to apply for divorce on the grounds of a spouse's adultery, a privilege which was then only available to men. She was defeated in the 1925 provincial election by Progressive candidate Charles Tran. She subsequently worked for the provincial library and for a number of women's organizations. In 1942, she married Regina businessman William George Franklin Scythes. She died in Prince Albert in 1964, at the age of 81.",

  "text" : "Shawn A-in-chut Atleo, kurz Shawn Atleo (* 16. Januar 1967 in Vancouver), ist ein kanadischer Politiker. Er ist Angehöriger der Ahousaht und von 2009 bis 2014 National Chief bzw. Chef national der Versammlung der First Nations. Atleo ist seit 1999 Erbhäuptling (hereditary chief) der Ahousaht, die an der Westküste von Vancouver Island, insbesondere auf Flores Island leben, und folgte darin seinem Vater. Atleo entstammt einer Häuptlingsfamilie, die sich 26 Generationen zurückverfolgen kann. Atleo, der Ururgroßvater des Ahousaht-Häuptlings Sam, hatte eine Vision während der Jagd im Tofino Inlet. Ein Otter verwandelte sich in einen Adler. Er machte in seiner Kindheit auf Flores Island vor der Westküste Vancouver Islands Erfahrungen mit Armut, die ihn tief geprägt haben. Schlecht dem extrem feuchten Klima der Westküste angepasste Behausungen und Selbstmorde unter seinen Freunden verstärkten seine Haltung, für bessere Bildung und Behausung, gegen Armut und Krankheit anzugehen. Seine Eltern beschlossen, die Insel zu verlassen. Atleo zog insgesamt 34 mal um, bevor er seinen Highschool-Abschluss machte. Auf dieser Schule lernte er seine spätere Frau Nancy kennen. Zusammen mit ihr hat er zwei erwachsene Kinder und lebt in Nanaimo. Atleo besaß ein Café am Commercial Drive in Vancouver, doch wurde er innerhalb eines Jahres von Starbucks verdrängt. Er zog in die Lobby des Campus’ des British Columbia Institute of Technology, wo er fünf Jahre lang sein Unternehmen erfolgreich führte, bevor er es an seinen Manager verkaufte. Atleo schloss 2003 sein Studium der Erwachsenenbildung an der University of Technology im australischen Sydney ab, das er als Online-Fernstudium absolvierte. Ab 2004 saß er im AFN Executive Committee, dem Exekutivrat der Versammlung der First Nations. 2008 wurde er zum Kanzler der Vancouver Island University, und damit zum ersten indigenen Kanzler in der Provinz, ähnlich wie sein Vater der erste promovierte Indianer an der University of British Columbia gewesen war. 2005 ging durch ein Übereinkommen der BC First Nations Leadership Council aus dem Regional Chief, der Union of BC Indian Chiefs und dem First Nations Summit hervor. Damit konnte die Uneinigkeit der drei indianischen Organisationen der Provinz weitgehend aufgehoben werden. Vor seiner Wahl zum Leiter der AFN war er ihr regionaler Führer in der Provinz British Columbia und er wurde 2006 von den 203 Häuptlingen der Provinz erneut in dieses Amt gewählt. Atleo war an der Erklärung über die Rechte der indigenen Völker der Vereinten Nationen beteiligt und eine der treibenden Kräfte, die das Thema der Residential Schools, auf die Tagesordnung setzten, und für die sich Premier Stephen Harper im Juni 2008 offiziell entschuldigte. Diese Entschuldigung für die schlechte Behandlung der Kinder der Ureinwohner in den für sie eingerichteten, internatartigen Schulen – mehrere tausend Klagen sind hier anhängig – hörte sich Atleo zusammen mit seiner 87-jährigen Großmutter an. Den Slogan für seine Wahlkampagne um die Leitung des AFN – It’s Our Time – formte er nach dem Vorbild Barack Obamas, der mit Yes we can seine Wahl betrieben hatte. Ähnlich wie der US-Präsident wurde er überwiegend von Jüngeren unterstützt. Nach seiner Aussage sind 54 % der Indianer Kanadas nach 1984 geboren, und Kanada sollte diesen „Tsunami der Jugend“ mit Bildung, Ausbildung und Arbeitsplätzen umfassen. Damit wandte er sich auch gegen die massive Einwanderungsförderung einiger Provinzen, die zudem die Löhne sinken ließ. Bei der Wahl setzte er sich gegen Perry Bellegarde, den Grand Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, nach acht Wahlrunden in 22 Stunden durch. Seine Wahl durch die 553 anwesenden (von 639) Häuptlinge (chiefs) nahm er in der Sprache der Ahousaht an. Atleo galt als Exponent der Gruppen, die auf Bildung, Sprachenvielfalt, Geschichte, Unterricht und Kulturwerte setzten, während Bellegarde, Häuptling der Little Black Bear First Nation in Saskatchewan, eher die ökonomische Stärkung vertrat. Atleo konzedierte vor der Versammlung: „Wir wissen, wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit ist politische Unabhängigkeit. Wirtschaftliche Macht ist politische Macht.“ Nach der Wahl galt sein erster Besuch einem Stamm in Saskatchewan, der Carry the Kettle First Nation. Damit brachte er seinen Respekt gegenüber dem in der Wahl Unterlegenen zum Ausdruck, aber auch seinen Willen, mit den sogenannten Treaty Indians eng zusammenzuarbeiten, den Stämmen also, die einen der nummerierten Verträge mit Kanada unterzeichnet haben. Ende August 2009 scheiterten die seit Jahren vorbereiteten, und von Atleo besonders betriebenen Verhandlungen über die Landnutzungsrechte der First Nations in British Columbia, die in ein Recognition and Reconciliation Act, in ein Anerkennungs- und Versöhnungsgesetz münden sollten. In British Columbia bestehen nur wenige Verträge mit den First Nations, im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Provinzen. Ein Teil der Stämme in der Provinz entzog den Unterhändlern offenbar die Unterstützung, ein Teil der Unternehmen entzog diese den Unterhändlern der 2010 wiedergewählten liberalen Regierung von Premierminister Gordon Campbell. Im Juli 2012 setzte er sich im dritten Wahlgang gegen sieben weitere Kandidaten um den Vorsitz im AFN mit 67 % der Häuptlinge des Landes durch. Zweitstärkste Kandidatin war Pamela Palmater, eine Angehörige der Mi'kmaq von der Ostküste. Atleo engagiert sich als Ratsmitglied des World Future Council für die Rechte zukünftiger Generationen. 2014 folgte ihm der 2009 unterlegene Perry Bellegarde übergangsweise im Amt des Grand Chief, nachdem Atleo wegen einer Kontroverse um Bill C-33 des Indian Act zurückgetreten war, in dem die Kontrolle über den Zugriff indigener Bildung durch die Regierung Harper verändert werden sollte. Sein politischer Kurs galt seinen Gegnern als zu eng mit dem der Regierung verbunden.",

  "text" : "Spencer Chandra Herbert is a Canadian politician who was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Representing the British Columbia New Democratic Party, he won the October 29, 2008, by-election in the electoral district of Vancouver-Burrard. He was re-elected to the Legislature, this time in the newly created riding of Vancouver-West End in the May 13, 2009 general election. Chandra Herbert's BC NDP formed the Official Opposition in both the 38th and 39th Parliaments and he was assigned to be the party's critic on tourism, arts and culture. He has introduced several pieces of legislation as private members' bills, though none have been adopted. The Long Term Tenants Protection Act, and his more comprehensive Residential Tenancy Amendment Act, were meant to address evictions and high rent increases that were occurring in the West End. He also introduced the Consumer Protection in Ticket Sales Act, 2009 which would have made ticket scalping illegal and the Gender Identity and Expression Human Rights Recognition Act which would have included gender identity and gender expression into the BC Human Rights Code as characteristic protected from discrimination. He entered the 38th Parliament at age 27, as its youngest Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and remained the youngest throughout the 39th Parliament. Prior to becoming a MLA, he was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. He served as a Parks Commissioner between 2005 and 2008 and was then a member of the Coalition of Progressive Electors. On the Parks Board he voted against removing the requirement for a referendum on an expansion of the Vancouver Aquarium but later voted in favour of the expansion. He advocate for bicycle valet service at large public events, investigating environmentally friendly means of disposing of animal waste, and implementing a zero-net-loss of greenspace policy. He is openly gay and married his partner, Romi Chandra, in March 2010. Afterwards, he legally changed his name to Spencer Chandra Herbert. Both Spencer and Romi have been active supporting causes within the LGBT community. At the provincial level, Chandra Herbert has advocated for a community victim services worker in Davie Village, a specialized telephone line for people to call to report incidents involving gay-bashing or verbal and physical assaults, and for school boards to include LGBT issues, especially in anti-bullying lessons.",

  "text" : "Stephen Durham (born 1947) is an American activist based in New York City, and the Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 general election. The socialist feminist FSP, a Trotskyist party, is running a write-in campaign that also includes Christina López, a Chicana feminist, for vice-president. Durham was born in North Carolina and grew up in Southern California. He attended the University of California at Berkeley during the 1960s, where he took part in protests of the Vietnam War and joined actions to gain Third World Studies. He was an early member of the gay rights movement and attended the first national lesbian and gay gathering, the West Coast Gay Liberation Conference, which took place in 1969 in Berkeley. Durham joined the Freedom Socialist Party and, in 1976, founded the Los Angeles branch of the organization. In 1984, he relocated to New York City, where he has served as the party organizer for many years. Durham worked as a union waiter in California and New York City. He mobilized with his female, of color and immigrant co-workers, during the 1985 New York City Hotel Trades Council strike by 16,000 workers. In this he was aided by his fluency in Spanish and Portuguese, which he gained in high school and retained through frequent travels to Latin America and the Caribbean where he has connected with other feminists and socialists. Durham’s first electoral effort for the FSP was in 1998, running for New York State Assembly the 71st District, a predominantly Latino and African American community. Campaign materials for the FSP claim that the party is “taking the unconventional route of a write-in campaign because corporate funding of the two major parties and restrictive ballot access laws stack the deck against minor parties.” According to Durham, “The FSP ticket is a chance for people to vote not only against something, but for something. The campaign is thrilled to be giving people a way to send a strong protest message, find new kindred souls, and strengthen organizing efforts for a future all workers deserve.” In California in 2012, Durham ran for the presidential nomination of the Peace & Freedom Party, a left-wing electoral ballot coalition. After a struggle against the Secretary of State's unilateral refusal to add Durham and Peta Lindsay, candidate for the Party for Socialism and Liberation, to the ballot, Durham was added to the list of primary candidates.",

He was first elected to North Bay City Council in 1973, and served as a city councillor until his elevation to the office of mayor, including serving as deputy mayor after 1978. He was appointed mayor in June 1984 following the death in office of Merle Dickerson, and was subsequently elected as mayor in the municipal elections of 1985, 1988 and 1991. His term in office was marked by initiatives that included the acquisition of the Dionne Quintuplets homestead as a community museum, the creation of a heritage train attraction in the city's Waterfront Park, the launch of \"Haleyfest\", a Christmas choral concert which still takes place annually in the city, and other economic development initiatives to revitalize the city's downtown and waterfront areas. During his term as mayor he also ran as an Ontario Liberal Party candidate in Nipissing in the 1990 provincial election, but lost to Mike Harris. He ran for another term as mayor of North Bay in the 2006 municipal election, but was defeated by incumbent mayor Vic Fedeli. Lawlor retired after teaching for nearly 45 years at Nipissing University. His son Sean Lawlor is also a former North Bay city councillor and deputy mayor. Since his retirement from Nipissing University, Lawlor has remained active as a consultant throughout Northern Ontario.",

Reynolds attended Woodman’s Academy in Chico, and Chico State Normal School, to which he enrolled at the age of seventeen, and continued for two and a half years. He then quit school to work in the fruit and nut business with his father, in 1898, when the firm of E. T. Reynolds and Son was established. Initially, they leased a warehouse, and eventually they bought a warehouse at the corner of First and Cedar Streets in Chico. In 1902, they built another warehouse, which had a railroad spur adjoining it at First and Cherry Streets. This warehouse still existed into the 21st-century, and was part of the Chico State campus under the same name as \"Reynolds Warehouse.\" By 1915, they were the largest handlers of almonds in the state. Their dried fruit business grew to the capacity of thirty-five hundred tons annually. Reynolds, with in partnership with others, owned the Cana Land Company, which comprised two hundred acres of fruit and nuts at Cana. Reynolds married Helen Adelia \"Nellie\" Davisson, in Suisun, in 1908. She was a Chico Normal School graduate, and school teacher until her marriage. In 1915, he was elected from the third ward as a trustee of the city. He served as chairman of the commission on fire, light and water. In 1919, he was elected president of the board of trustees. On June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a Board of Freeholders charged with framing a City Charter. On April 16, 1923, at-large elections were reinstated under the charter. Under the charter, the board of trustees was renamed the Chico City Council, and its chair was titled the Mayor. Reynolds was the last mayor to be titled \"president\" of the \"board of trustees\" before it became the modern Chico City Council.",

  "text" : "Major James William Coldwell, PC CC (December 2, 1888 – August 25, 1974), usually known as M.J. (Major was his first name, not a military title), was a Canadian social democratic politician, and leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) party from 1942 to 1960. He was born in England, and immigrated to Canada in 1910. Prior to his political career, he was an educator and union activist. In 1935 he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons, representing the Rosetown—Biggar electoral district. He would be re-elected five more times until he was defeated in the 1958 Diefenbaker sweep. He was the CCF's first national secretary in 1934, and became its national leader upon the death of J. S. Woodsworth in 1942. He remained as its leader until 1960, when there was a parliamentary caucus revolt against him. When the CCF was disbanded 1961, he joined its successor party, the NDP. He is mainly remembered for helping to introduce \"welfare state\" policies to Canada, by persuading the Canadian government to introduce an Old Age Security programme, and child benefits during the mid-1940s. Coldwell turned down several offers to cross the floor and join the governing Liberal Party of Canada, including one offer that eventually would have made him the Prime Minister of Canada. After his defeat in 1958, he was offered a Senate appointment, but declined it as well. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1964 and in 1967 became one of the initial inductees into the Order of Canada. After suffering two heart attacks on the same day, he died in Ottawa at the age of 85.",

  "text" : "Marc Godbout (born June 8, 1951) is the former Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ottawa—Orléans riding. He was first elected in the 2004 Canadian federal election, representing the Liberal Party of Canada. Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Godbout has a Master's degree in education from the University of Ottawa. Before entering politics, he worked as a high school history teacher. He has been Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for elementary and secondary education in Ontario and Director General and Secretary Treasurer of the Conseil des écoles catholiques de langue française du Centre-Est de l’Ontario. He entered federal politics by running for the Liberal nomination against sitting Liberal MP Eugène Bellemare. Bellemare, who held the riding for several elections, was removed. After his defeat in the nomination, Bellemare retired from politics. Godbout succeeded in beating the Conservative candidate Walter Robinson in the general election of 2004, by a slim majority. He campaigned on bringing more federal government jobs to the east end of Ottawa. In the 2006 general election, Godbout ran on a platform of Liberal support for municipalities and infrastructure. After eighteen years of the riding being held by the Liberals, Godbout was defeated for re-election when the Conservative Party of Canada won the riding under Royal Galipeau in the federal election of January 23, 2006. Godbout, along with a number of former and present Ontario Liberal MPs endorsed party leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy. At the Liberal Party Convention in Montreal, Godbout supported Michael Ignatieff after Kennedy dropped off the ballot. At the final ballot, Ignatieff was defeated by Stéphane Dion. On April 29, 2007, Godbout was nominated to run in the 40th Canadian federal election in a re-match against Galipeau. In the 2008 Canadian federal election, Godbout lost for the second time in a row to Conservative incumbent Royal Galipeau, and this time by an increased majority. The re-election of Galipeau marks the first time a Conservative candidate has been re-elected in the Orléans riding since 1872. In July 2009, Godbout announced that he would not make another run at reclaiming the riding in the next federal election. He said the decision was a professional one, as he wanted to focus on his business, a consulting firm, operating out of the east end.",

  "text" : "Marianne Cerilli (born 1961) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She served as a New Democratic member of the Manitoba legislature from 1990 until 2003, though she was not called to cabinet when the party formed government in 1999. Cerilli was born in Toronto, raised in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba (from which she holds a B.P.E. and a Bachelor of Education degree). Before entering political life, she worked as a high school athletics coach, and was a counsellor in the Winnipeg School Division. She also worked at the Unemployed Health Centre of Winnipeg, and was a consultant to Manitoba Employment and Youth Services for three years. Cerilli initially intended to run for the NDP in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Broadway in the 1990 provincial election, but lost the party nomination to Conrad Santos by one vote. She instead ran in the northeast Winnipeg riding of Radisson, where she defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Mike Thompson by almost 1500 votes (incumbent Liberal Allan Patterson finished third). The Progressive Conservatives won the general election, and Cerilli joined nineteen other New Democrats in the official opposition. At the time she was the youngest woman ever elected to the Manitoba legislature. Cerilli was re-elected in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal Art Miki by 4891 votes to 2401. The Progressive Conservatives won the general election again; during her time in opposition, Cerilli served as NDP critic for Housing, Workplace Safety, Health and Youth. She was regarded as one of the more left-wing members of caucus, and was the only Manitoba MLA to support Svend Robinson, rather than Lorne Nystrom, for the leadership of the federal NDP in 1995. The NDP were victorious in the 1999 provincial election, and Cerilli personally defeated Progressive Conservative Henry McDonald by 5198 votes to 3114. She was not appointed to cabinet, but served as legislative assistant to the Minister of Family Services and Housing. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party. Prior to the 2003 provincial election, she decided to leave her Radisson riding to run for the nomination in Wolseley. She lost to current MLA Rob Altemeyer. She now teaches part-time at the University of Winnipeg, and is operating a community development business. On September 15, 2006, Cerilli officially registered as a candidate for Mayor of the City of Winnipeg in the 2006 municipal election, but lost to incumbent mayor Sam Katz.",

  "text" : "Mark C. Poloncarz (born November 7, 1967) is the county executive of Erie County, New York. Poloncarz, a Democrat, was elected county executive on November 8, 2011 after defeating the incumbent county executive Chris Collins a Republican by a 53 - 47 percentage point margin. Poloncarz was re-elected on November 3, 2015 with 66% of the vote when he easily defeated the Republican candidate Raymond Walter (33% of the vote) and Green Party candidate Eric Jones (1% of the vote). Poloncarz is only the 2nd Democrat to be elected to the position of county executive in the 51-year history of the position. Entering 2015 Poloncarz was heavily favored to be re-elected county executive; however it was expected he would face a Republican challenge from one of three candidates: incumbent county clerk and former New York Secretary of State Christopher Jacobs, incumbent county comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, or legislator Ed Rath, the grandson of the first Erie County Executive Edward Rath. In the end, all three individuals decided not to run and Walter was chosen by the Republicans. Unlike 2015, when Poloncarz entered the race in May 2011 he was a heavy underdog. However, by focusing on issues of providing efficient, yet cost-effective government, reducing waste, fraud and abuse of the public's tax dollars, supporting the \"People's Mandates,\" and properly funding libraries and arts and cultural institutions, Poloncarz was able to chip away a sizable Collins lead until he won in surprisingly easy fashion. Poloncarz also capitalized on his \"son of a steelworker\" blue collar background against Collins self-proclaimed businessman style. Since taking office as Erie County Executive, Poloncarz worked to change the culture of Erie County government and return it to its core mission: provide the programs and services that residents and taxpayers demand as effectively and efficiently as possible. And as such, he made it a priority to restore funding for what he calls the “People’s Mandates,” which include the rodent control program, parks improvements, road and bridge construction, libraries, summer youth programming and a renewed commitment to arts and cultural organizations. These programs were restored by Poloncarz in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes. As evidence of the fiscal stewardship, in 2014, Standard & Poor’s upgraded the county’s credit rating three steps to “AA-” and in 2015 Fitch Ratings upgraded the county's credit rating to \"A+.\" In early 2015, Poloncarz released “Initiatives for a Stronger Community,” his health and human services plan for Erie County. The plan included 49 separate initiatives to address issues of poverty throughout the county, including issues facing the City of Buffalo, which was identified as the 3rd poorest city in America when Poloncarz took office in 2012. Poloncarz also shepherded a pay equity policy through the Erie County Industrial Development Agency requiring all applicants for tax incentives to agree to a policy to provide salary data to the agency to prove they do in fact pay women equally. In 2015, Poloncarz also worked with the county legislature to pass a budget for 2016 that reduced the county's property tax rate from $4.99 to $4.96 per thousand of assessed value, the second year in a row the county's tax rate was reduced. 2014 was a significant year for the Poloncarz administration, including working with the legislature to pass a balanced budget with a small tax cut, opening the Erie County Health Mall, signing an executive order requiring that all contractors with Erie County comply with equal pay laws for women, restructuring the Department of Social Services to address issues with the Division of Child Protective Services, and managing the emergency response to four major weather-related events: two blizzards, flooding in West Seneca and the worst storm to hit the region in nearly 40 years: Winter Storm Knife a/k/a Snowvember Storm. In 2013, Poloncarz announced his “Initiatives for a Smart Economy,” which represents his administration’s commitment to a comprehensive, innovative approach to economic development and provides the “missing link,” tying a host of diverse initiatives into one regional development effort. Specifically, this plan includes a total of 64 initiatives across a dozen areas, representing the economic gears that, working together, will help drive our economic future. More than half of these Initiatives are complete and showing results around Erie County. In fact, since Poloncarz took office as county executive in January, 2012, more than 16,000 new private sector jobs have been created in the Buffalo-Niagara Metropolitan Area, and the county's unemployment rate has dropped from 8.9% in January, 2012 to 4.7% as of December, 2015. Additionally, Poloncarz has stated the key to his administration’s success is to create strong partnerships with other levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, educational institutions and community groups. Examples include the creation of one of New York State’s first Land Banks, the establishment of the Erie County Medicaid Anti-Fraud Unit, as well as the successful negotiation of a new 10-year lease with the Buffalo Bills that is fair for local and state taxpayers and kept the team in Buffalo following the death of the team's owner Ralph Wilson Jr. At the time Poloncarz ran for county executive in 2011 he was the elected county comptroller in Erie County. Poloncarz was first elected comptroller in 2005 and was re-elected in 2009 in a three-person race by defeating Republican Phil Kadet and Independence Party candidate Michael Abramo by a 52 - 45 - 3 percentage point margin, respectively. Prior to being elected comptroller Poloncarz was an American business and finance lawyer residing in Buffalo, New York.

  "text" : "Margaret L. Bridgman (January 10, 1940 – January 4, 2009) was a Canadian politician. Bridgman was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 1997, representing the Canadian, federal electoral district of Surrey North in Surrey, British Columbia. Born in Kimberley, British Columbia, she was elected to Parliament for Surrey North in the 1993 election as a candidate of the Reform Party of Canada. In 2001, Bridgman unsuccessfully ran for the Reform Party of British Columbia in the riding of Surrey-Newton. Before entering politics, Brigdman was a police constable, a nurse, and a nurse administrator. As a young woman, Bridgman lived and worked in London as a police constable (traffic bobby). Subsequently, she trained in London as a psychiatric nurse, becoming a Registered Nurse (RN) and a Psychiatric Nurse (PN) before returning to Canada. Bridgman went on to earn the Director of Nursing designation from the University of Saskatchewan, rising to become a nurse administrator. In September 1993, the designated Reform Party candidate for Surrey North resigned his nomination. Bridgman was President of the Surrey North Reform Party Constituency Association, and she was selected to run as the Reform Party candidate. On October 25, 1993, Margaret Bridgman was elected the Member of Parliament for Surrey North, unseating the incumbent with a plurality of 6413 votes. Prior to Bridgman's landmark victory, Surrey North and its predecessor ridings had been held either by the New Democratic Party or the Progressive Conservative Party since 1958. Bridgman served as the Reform Party Critic on Health and Assistant Critic on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. She sat as the Reform Party member of the House of Commons Standing Committees on Health and on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, during the 35th Parliament. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons, Bridgman focused on the need for more effective and cost-conscious funding of health care in Canada. Bridgman's interventions in the House of Commons ranged from remarks on health care and Indian Affairs to young offenders, old age security, and the spending priorities of the Canadian parliament. In 1997, Bridgman was successfully challenged for the Reform Party nomination by Chuck Cadman. Bridgman opted not to run as an independent in the 1997 general election, and she did not run, again, in a federal, electoral race. Following the 1997 election, Bridgman returned to nursing in Surrey, British Columbia. After a sustained battle with lung cancer, Margaret Bridgman died at home on January 4, 2009.",

Originally elected as an independent, Byblow joined the Yukon New Democratic Party caucus on September 16, 1981. He retired in 1985, and was succeeded by Jim McLachlan. He was re-elected to the legislature in the 1989 election, and served until 1992.

  "text" : "Maurice Lamoureux is a former politician in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He was an alderman for several years, and served as mayor of Sudbury from 1981 to 1982. Lamoureux was an office supervisor at Falconbridge Ltd. in private life. He retired in 1992, and later worked as a real estate representative with Coldwell Banker Marsh Real Estate. He was first elected as an alderman in the municipal election of 1964. He was twice defeated for the provincial New Democratic Party nomination, and later joined the Progressive Conservative Party. He was chosen as deputy mayor by council in 1978, and became acting mayor in 1981 when Jim Gordon suspended his duties to run for the provincial legislature. Gordon was elected to the legislature in the 1981 provincial election, and members of Sudbury City Council chose Lamoureux as his replacement on March 30, 1981. His only opponent, Sterling Campbell, withdrew before voting took place. Newspaper reports indicate that council declined to hold a by-election, even though almost twenty months remained in Gordon's two-year term. Lamoureux was chosen as mayor at a time of hostile relations between Sudbury City Council and the Sudbury Regional Council. He opposed a round of layoffs at Inco in 1982, and called on local businesses to support striking workers. Lamoureux brought forward what he described as a \"severe attrition policy\" in 1982, cutting 19 jobs to save $500,000 at city hall. Several senior bureaucrats were demoted, and many chose to resign. One of the bureaucrats to lose his job was city engineer Peter Wong, who later challenged Lamoureux for the mayoral position. Wong argued that it was inconsistent for Lamoureux to target the city's high unemployment rate while simultaneously cutting municipal jobs. On election day, Wong defeated Lamoureux for the mayor's position. Lamoureux was later re-elected to city council. In 1987, he argued that the city was losing money from selling surplus land at less than the assessed value. He criticized the federal government's cuts to unemployment insurance in 1989, arguing that it would devastate Sudbury's economy. Lamoureux campaigned for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1993 federal election as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party, and finished third against Liberal incumbent Diane Marleau. In 2000, he was appointed by provincial Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Tony Clement to a transitional board to amalgamate Sudbury and its neighbouring communities into the new city of Greater Sudbury. Board members were paid $400 per day. After his appointment, Lamoureux acknowledged that he was not entirely comfortable with an appointed board imposing terms on elected officials. He supported the board's decision to merge Sudbury Hydro, Capreol Hydro and Nickel Centre Hydro into Greater Sudbury Utilities, and said the board made the right decision in not selling the utilities to Ontario Hydro One. Lamoureux resigned from the transition board in October 2000 to run for the Greater Sudbury Municipal Council in the 2000 municipal election. He defended the work of the transition board, and called for tax cuts through the amalgamation process. He was defeated, finishing fifth in a two-member ward. He later applied to council for a position on Greater Sudbury Utilities, but was not hired. He ran again in the 2003 municipal election, calling for a five-year roads program. He finished sixth in the city's fourth ward. In May 2003, Lamoureux purchased a former nursing home in Sudbury called Garson Manor. He reopened the building the following year as alternative housing for seniors.",

Roman attended New Jersey City University earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in urban education. She worked as a teacher and supervisor for the Jersey City Board of Education. Roman became involved in politics as a member of the Everett Terrace Block Association where she served as a representative attending City Council Meetings. At the urging of McCann, she was elected to the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1984 and served two terms. Running on McCann's ticket, Roman was elected to the city council in 1989. Roman was director of the Education-Business Alliance of the Jersey City Board of Education and president of the City Council when McCann was removed from office following his conviction on Federal fraud charges. Roman continued to fill the vacancy when the city council failed to elect another candidate after 30 days. Roman served as mayor for four months until the city council reorganized and selected a new Council President. Following the announced retirement of Congressman Frank J. Guarini, Roman organized and supported a slate of candidates in the 1992 Democratic Primary. She claimed to organize the ticket to support candidates for the Democratic County Committee farther down the ballot. Roman's candidates were opposed by a slate headed by State Senator Robert Menendez and supported by Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski. Menendez defeated Robert P. Haney by a ratio of 2-1, and Roman's candidates for Democratic County Committee only won one-third of the seats. The City Council of Jersey City reorganized on July 1, 1992 and selected Joseph Rakowski as the new president. Rakowski also became acting mayor and the third mayor in that year. Roman retained her seat on the city council and completed her term. She ran to fill the remainder of the unexpired term in the special election, but came in third out of a field of nineteen candidates.",

  "text" : "Michael \"Mickey\" Cafagna (July 26, 1943 - April 11, 2009) was the third elected mayor of the city of Poway, California, serving from 1998 until his death in 2009. Cafagna was born in Detroit, Michigan, the third son of Italian immigrants. He moved to Poway (then an unincorporated part of San Diego County) circa 1975; following a successful career as a real estate developer, he was appointed to the Poway City Council in 1992, eventually winning the mayoral election in November 1998. As Mayor, Cafagna represented Poway in the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), serving for a time as its chairman. His other contributions include the construction of Poway's city hall and of the South Poway Business Park on Scripps Poway Parkway, his efforts to fund much-needed improvements to freeways and transit systems, and his leadership during the Cedar and Witch Creek fires of 2003 and 2007, respectively. He was most known for his outgoing personality and his ability to make deals for the benefit of the city. His genial manner also aided him in public situations; Deputy Mayor Don Higginson recounted an incident at the 1998 World Series between the New York Yankees and the San Diego Padres where Cafagna - just before his election as Mayor - invited Higginson and about a hundred others to travel to New York for the first two games. During Game 1, the Poway contingent sat among the Yankee fans, who booed them and threw beer on them. While others got up and left, Cafagna remained and offered to buy the Yankee fans a beer. By the end of the game, they were applauding him; when the party returned for Game 2, the Yankee fans cheered him. Even his political opponents, such as Poway's first mayor Bob Emery, acknowledged that while they had been opposed to his philosophies at first (Cafagna was a real estate developer, while Emery advocated slow-growth policy), they began to see things from his point of view, just as he saw things from theirs, and they grew to respect his character and his genial attitude. Cafagna had in fact avoided doing his development business in Poway to avoid conflicts of interest, and as Mayor opposed helter-skelter sprawl throughout the region (often with the \"How much do we have to grow before we destroy the reasons we live here\" speech, as Emery termed it). In 2005, Cafagna was diagnosed with kidney cancer and underwent an operation to remove it. However, it returned nearly four years later, having spread to his lungs. His illness prevented him from conducting day-to-day city government, and as a result Deputy Mayor Higginson became acting mayor. Cafagna was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on March 5 from what was previously thought to be pneumonia, but later determined to be septic shock; he died there on April 11, at the age of 65. After services at St. Michael's Catholic Church, he was buried a week later at Dearborn Memorial Park in Poway. Cafagna was survived by his wife of 43 years, Sharon Green Cafagna, as well as their two children, Kevin and Stacy, and five grandchildren.",

  "text" : "Mike McLarnon is a former Canadian politician, who represented the electoral district of Whitehorse Centre in the Yukon Legislative Assembly from 2000 to 2002. McLarnon was born and raised in Whitehorse, Yukon and operated several businesses in Whitehorse until assuming political office in the Yukon Legislature. While in office, he served as the Deputy Speaker of the Yukon Legislature and the Chair of the Committee of the Whole. He also served on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on behalf of the Yukon. He was elected as a member of the Yukon Liberal Party in the 2000 election. In that election, he beat out the incumbent MLA Todd Hardy, who was the NDP candidate, and Vicky Durrant, the Yukon Party candidate, by a wide margin. However, in 2002 he was one of three MLAs, along with Wayne Jim and Don Roberts, who resigned from the Liberal Party caucus in 2002 to protest the leadership of Pat Duncan, effectively reducing Duncan's government to a minority. He continued to sit as an independent until the time that the following election was called. Analysts claim that the Liberal party's newfound minority party status and subsequent pressure from the opposition is what eventually led to the end of the Liberal party's position in the legislature. In the resulting 2002 election, McLarnon ran as an independent candidate and was defeated by New Democratic Party leader Todd Hardy. Prior to operating his own business and eventually running for political office, McLarnon pursued his higher education at Carleton University (Ottawa) and the British Columbia Institute of Technology (Vancouver). While at Carleton University, McLarnon served in the House of Commons Page Program. McLarnon is married and continues to maintain residence in Whitehorse. He is a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal for his work in representing the political interests of Yukoners.",

Tindal was raised in the rural village of Victoria Square, Ontario, and earned a MA in psychology from the University of Toronto. Before her election, Tindal was already well-known within the United Church of Canada as the co-host of a United Church television program, Spirit Connection. She was also an adult educator, author, video producer, led pilgrimages to Iona (Scotland), was involved in continuing education in Jamaica, and just prior to her election, was Executive Director of Five Oaks Centre, one of the United Church’s education centres. In her remarks to the Council following her election, Tindal spoke of entering into a covenant with the church “as we live into ministry together.” Meeting with reporters afterwards, her first wish was to support the church in its desire to live in covenant relationship with God and with each other in a caring stewardship of Creation. “I am committed to encouraging young leaders... I am deeply committed to [a] right relationship with creation, in and beyond our faith community... I will be inviting the church to imagine new ways of caring for creation ... We are called to portray the integrity of creation.\" Speaking about the United Church's current struggles with declining membership and depleted financial resources, Tindal said, \"What's most important is to discern what's faithful, set a course, trust in God's abundance, and invite people into it.\" Tindal currently lives in Toronto, Ontario with her husband. She has two children, Chris, a candidate in the 2010 Toronto municipal election, and Alex, a comedy writer and performer.",

While the 18th district leans only slightly Democratic, having a Cook PVI D+4, Cardoza only faced serious competition in 2002, when he was first elected to the seat. This race is considered competitive in 2010 because of Mike's experience in local agriculture, his family name, and the current political climate. Berryhill comes from a Republican political family that's well known in the San Joaquin Valley. Mike’s Uncle, Clare Berryhill, served in both houses of the California State Legislature and also served as director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture under Governor George Deukmejian. His first cousins, Tom and Bill Berryhill, currently represent the 25th and 26th districts, respectively, in the California State Assembly. Mike was president of Young Farmers and Ranchers of California and elected to the Turlock Irrigation District Board. He also served several decades on the Ceres School Board, and, in 2005, Berryhill Elementary School was named in honor of Mike and other members of the Berryhill family who served on the school board.",

She has since indicated via her Twitter account that this was not accurate, and she does not agree with those positions. Fragedakis was critical of the KPMG report recommending cuts to services and programs without studying the implications of the proposed cuts.",

Hilkens studierte Journalistik in Tilburg und war zuerst als Musikjournalistin für verschiedene Magazine, zum Beispiel auch für die niederländischen Zeitschrift OOR, tätig. Sie wirkte danach unter anderem bei BN/De Stem mit, und am Tageblatt De Pers. Auch arbeitete sie für verschiedene TV-Sender. Zusammen mit ihrer Mutter stand sie in einer Sendung des Programms De wandeling der KRO vor der Kamera, zum Thema „Frauen und Sexualität“ (niederländisch: vrouwen en seksualiteit); zu diesem Thema erschienen von ihr mehrere Publikationen. Hilkens engagiert sich damit gegen Tendenzen, die sie als Pornofizierung (niederländisch: pornoficatie) des Zusammenlebens bezeichnet. Darunter versteht sie die Zuspitzung menschlicher Kommunikation und menschlichen Zusammenlebens lediglich auf Gesichtspunkte eines bestimmten Verständnisses von sexueller Attraktion. Mit der Sicht auf Sexualität in den einflussreichsten Pornos sei die Herabwürdigung der Frau zum bloßen Lustobjekt verbunden, so Hilkens. Auch gegen Gewaltpornographie sprach sie sich aus.Es sollen stattdessen, so Hilkens, in Darstellungen von Sex, zum Beispiel in Pornos, stärker die Frauen als Menschen mit Gefühlen und einem Willen, sowie Sex als Interaktion zwischen zwei gleichen Menschen gezeigt werden, die Identitäten der Männer und Frauen sollen eine Rolle spielen. Myrthe Hilkens kandidierte 2010 für die sozialdemokratische PvdA zum niederländischen Parlament. Vom 12. April bis zum 2. August 2011 war sie vorübergehend Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Generalstaaten. Von Januar 2012 bis August 2013 war sie erneut Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer.",

Quick dropped his Reform Party congressional bid in May of 2012, and at a news conference announced his public endorsement of a LaRouche PAC candidate, Diane Sare, for Congress.

Er wuchs in Soweto auf, wo er die Schule besuchte. Danach studierte er Psychologie an der University of South Africa (mit Abschluss eines BA), der Witwatersrand-Universität (mit Abschluss eines Masters in Öffentlicher Verwaltung) und an der Bangor University in Wales, wo er einen Mastergrad in Theologie erwarb. 2011 war Aloysias Mmusi Maimane Spitzen- und Bürgermeisterkandidat bei der Kommunalwahl in der Metropolgemeinde City of Johannesburg. Die DA konnte unter seiner Führung ein Ergebnis von rund 35 % (+ 7 Prozentpunkte) der Stimmen erzielen. Das gute Abschneiden seiner Partei brachte Maimane schlagartig nationale politische Aufmerksamkeit ein. Nach der Kommunalwahl übernahm er das Amt des Fraktionsvorsitzenden und Oppositionsführers im Stadtrat der City of Johannesburg. 2012 wurde Maimane zum stellvertretenden Parteivorsitzenden der Democratic Alliance gewählt und konnte sich damit gegen acht weitere Kandidaten durchsetzen. Bei den Wahlen 2014 wurde Aloysias Mmusi Maimane für die DA in die südafrikanische Nationalversammlung gewählt und übernahm dort den Vorsitz der DA-Fraktion. Im Juni 2014 stellte er sein Schattenkabinett vor. Am 10. Mai 2015 wurde Maimane anstelle von Helen Zille zum Parteivorsitzenden der DA gewählt. Maimane ist verheiratet und hat zwei Kinder. Seine Frau ist eine weiße Südafrikanerin. Nach den Angaben auf der DA-Webseite spricht er fließend sieben südafrikanische Sprachen.

  "text" : "Mario Felice Ferri (born January 6, 1948, Pescosolido, Italy) is an Italian-Canadian community organizer, activist, and a former deputy mayor of Vaughan, Ontario, who co-founded an organization credited with helping to force the closure of Canada’s largest municipal waste facility, the Keele Valley Landfill. At the time of its closure the waste facility was the third largest in North America near the heart of Vaughan, the fifth largest city in the Greater Toronto Area. The waste landfill site became the centre of a 14 year battle between the citizens of Vaughan and both the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, which owned and operated the site. Mr. Ferri co-founded Vaughan CARES, an activist group that became prominent in the fight to close the waste facility. As a community organizer Ferri also contributed to numerous cultural organizations and helped organize large events, as well as administering community recreational facilities in Toronto, Vaughan and other surrounding communities. In his roles as a York Region Separate School Board trustee, municipal and regional councillor and deputy mayor he undertook several community campaigns and frequently acted as a spokesperson for the school board, the City of Vaughan and for York Region. In October 2014 Ferri was elected to his fifth term as a councillor for the City of Vaughan and his third term as a councillor for the Region of York, Ontario.",

He was born in Harleston, Northamptonshire, England and baptized in Saint Andrews Church on February 27, 1604. He was the son of Gregory and Joan Camfield. He came to the New Haven Colony from England prior to 1637. He was a collector for Yale College in 1645. He served as an officer in the Cavalry Troop of Connecticut from 1650-66. In February 1652, Camfield sold his home lot in New Haven. That year, he moved to Norwalk, becoming one of the area's original settlers. He lived in Norwalk for fourteen years, becoming one of the settlement's and the colony's prominent citizens. He was a deputy of the Connecticut General Court from Norwalk in 1654. In 1662, he was a magistrate and judge for the court in Fairfield. He was one of the 19 signers of the Petition to King Charles II for the Charter of the Colony. In 1666, Matthew removed to Newark, Province of New Jersey along with Robert Treat, where he was one of the founders of that town. His home lot was located at about the present north-west corner of Washington and Market Streets. Apparent his departure from Norwalk is based upon some dissatisfaction with the union of the New Haven and Hartford colonies. Canfield Island in East Norwalk is named for him. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery.",

Educated in Montreal at Sir George Williams University and Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal, he was a telephone technician. In 1962, he married Claudia June Burns. After serving two years on Halifax County Council, MacKay entered provincial politics in the 1978 election, defeating Liberal incumbent George Doucet in the new Sackville riding. He was re-elected in the 1981 election. In the 1984 election, MacKay was defeated by New Democrat John Holm, finishing third behind Liberal Bill MacDonald. Controversy arose during the campaign, when MacKay admitted he used a false address to claim expenses as a member living away from the capital. In April 1985, an Auditor General's report asked MacKay to repay over $7,000 in extra expenses. The money was paid back and MacKay was not charged criminally. In February 2004, a political comeback bid ended when MacKay's candidacy for the Conservative nomination in Halifax West for the 2004 federal election was rejected by the party. MacKay attempted to return to provincial politics in the 2006 election, running for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in Hants East, but finished third.",

According to Robertson, in accordance with the process for resigning from the legislature he had submitted his resignation notice to two fellow MLAs, McFadyen and Peter McLaren, but a procedural error in McFadyen and McLaren's handling of the document had left the resignation improperly registered.",

Hague has a widely known reputation for corruption and bossism and has been called \"the grandaddy of Jersey bosses.\" By the time he left office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the Plaza Hotel. His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million at the time of his death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income. His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his \"guests\" to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash. However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallinan, the drawers were a traditional feature of 19th century partners desks and that \"[t]he last thing [Hague] would need to do is take a bribe personally.\" As of September 2013, the desk was in storage awaiting restoration. During the height of his power Hague's political machine, known as \"the organization,\" was one of the most powerful in the United States controlling politics on local, county, and state levels.

He served from 1 July 1896 to 1901. He was also an amateur painter, photographer and antique collector. He was born in Belper, Derbyshire, Britain and was educated at the Dollar Academy in Scotland and St Peter's School, York. He was a descendant of Mathew Swetenham, Henry IV's bow bearer. He was one of close to forty former British Empire officials to oppose the Malayan Union. Swettenham co-authored a \"A Dictionary of the Malay Language\" with Hugh Clifford. The dictionary, which was published in stages between 1894 and 1902, was abandoned after the letter 'G' as by then it had been made redundant by the publiciation of R.J. Wilkinson's \"A Malay English Dictionary\". He also published four books \"Malay Sketches\", \"Unaddressed Letters\", \"Also & Perhaps\" and \"Arabella in Africa\", the latter being illustrated by the famous mural painter and illustrator, Rex Whistler.

After the death of his father in 1891, Green relocated to Montreal to attend McGill University where he would obtain his medical degree.Upon his graduation from McGill in 1898, Green worked as a physician on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway Crowsnest Pass line, in the Kootenay Valley, working on horseback. During the time he operated a hospital and treated many during an epidemic of typhoid. He later settled at Cranbrook, British Columbia, in the Kootenay Valley in 1899 to establish a medical practice. He was one of the first and only physicians, a medical pioneer at Cranbrook. A partnership with Dr. James Horace King of Cranbrook which started in 1903 was described as a \"cornerstone in local medicine\", with modern innovations being in use at the time, two examples being the first x-ray machine in the city being purchased for their hospital and the use of automobiles within the practice. In the British Columbia general election, 1941, Green was elected as a Conservative to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for the district of Cranbrook. He was elected again in 1945 as a coalition member, serving until his retirement in 1949. He married Lillian Barbara Staples of Stillwater, Minnesota in June 1905. One of his sons, William Otis Green also became a doctor in the Cranbrook area, with whom he later shared a practice with. Frank W. Green died in 1953 of heart problems at St. Eugene Hospital in Cranbrook, which he had established. He was later cremated in Calgary. His wife Lillian died on October 22, 1965 at Cranbrook. The F. W. Green Medical Centre and F. W. Green Memorial Home continuing care centre at Cranbrook are both named after him.",

His father, Dr. William Fee moved to Melbourne in 1884, and Frank Fee moved to Melbourne from Franklin, in 1887. He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. He served as city alderman in Fort Pierce from 1904 to 1905, and as mayor from 1905 to 1907. Fee apparently had advanced views for his times. He opposed the death penalty and he supported compulsory education.",

The returning officer cast the deciding vote for Tidman, declaring him the winner. The Liberals appealed the result and a judge declared the vote null and void and ordered a by-election. On November 16, 1971, Bezanson won the by-election, defeating Progressive Conservative Fred Chisholm by 323 votes. Bezanson was re-elected in the 1974 election.

He was mayor of Glace Bay from 1913 to 1915 when he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force fighting in World War I. He was elected a Conservative MLA in 1925 representing Cape Breton Centre and his support from miners helped ensure the Conservative Party's victory in that election. Harrington became Minister of Labour in the government of Edgar N. Rhodes and became Premier of Nova Scotia when Rhodes left provincial politics to ender the federal cabinet in 1930. During Harrington's term he was able to end ongoing labour disturbance among miners in Cape Breton which had afflicted the previous two premiers. He improved the provincial department of mining, fought for the coal and steel industries in Ottawa, and passed legislation calling for a national policy on coal and steel. However, his government was unable to combat the Great Depression and was defeated by the Liberals in the 1933 election. Harrington remained in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly until 1937. His government was the last Conservative government until Robert Stanfield was able to take power in 1956.",

  "text" : "Glenn De Baeremaeker is a city councillor in Toronto, Canada, who represents Ward 38, one of the two Scarborough Centre wards. The son of a working-class family, he has a Masters in international development and spent six months in Ethiopia at the height of the 1980s famine. He originally rose to prominence for his work with the Save the Rouge group fighting to keep the Rouge Valley area of Scarborough free from development. A strong environmentalist, De Baeremaeker is a vegan. Working as an assistant to city councillor Doug Mahood, De Baeremaeker ran for a seat on Scarborough city council in 1994 but lost to David Soknacki. Continuing his environmental work, De Baeremaeker became one of the leaders in the effort to save the Oak Ridges Moraine from development. When Brad Duguid left city council in 2003 to run for the provincial Liberals, De Baeremaeker decided to run for the empty seat and triumphed by a wide margin. De Baeremaeker is notable for cycling to City Hall from his home in Scarborough almost every day year round. He is a strong advocate for safer road conditions for cyclists. De Baeremaeker is also known for his support of former Mayor David Miller's policies, in particular his support of the civic workers' deal to end the 2009 Toronto municipal strike.",

This order was suspended, and the initial judgement was overturned on appeal. Mammoliti re-joined the executive committee in October 2013. Previously, Mammoliti served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1995. In 2002, he switched names from the anglicized George to the Italian Giorgio. On October 15, 2009, he declared his candidacy for mayor in Toronto's 2010 election. In July, after registering no more than 4% in public opinion polls over several months, Mammoliti withdrew from the mayoral contest in order to stand for re-election as a city councillor. On July 9, 2014, Toronto City Council suspended Mammoliti for three months for holding fundraisers contrary to the Council's code of conduct. On September 15, police have launched an investigation into the matter.",

Johann Erich Biester unterrichtete ihn in Griechisch und Latein. In sein Vaterland zurückgekehrt, wurde er 1782 in der Garde des Erbstatthalters Wilhelm V. angestellt, studierte aber später in Leiden Rechtswissenschaften, stand 1787 während der Unruhen auf oranischer Seite und wurde nach Unterdrückung derselben Pensionär (Stadtschreiber) von Rotterdam, von welchem Posten er nach der Eroberung Hollands durch die Franzosen 1795 zurücktrat, um in Amsterdam ein Kaufmannsgeschäft zu übernehmen. Durch seinen fehlgeschlagenen Plan, eine Kolonie für die Anhänger des Hauses Oranien am Kap der Guten Hoffnung zu gründen, büßte er den größten Teil seines Vermögens ein; dagegen trug er 1813 wesentlich zur Befreiung Hollands vom französischen Okkupation bei, indem er, als die Verbündeten siegreich vordrangen, die Anhänger des Prinzen von Oranien in Den Haag vereinigte. Als Präsident der Kommission, welche mit der Entwerfung der neuen Verfassungsurkunde beauftragt war, übte er einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die übrigen Kommissionsmitglieder aus, so dass er der Haupturheber des niederländischen Staatsgrundgesetzes war. Darauf erhielt er das Departement der auswärtigen Angelegenheiten, wurde Vizepräsident des Staatsrats und 1815 Graf, nahm aber schon 1816 wegen Kränklichkeit seine Entlassung. Als Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Generalstaaten, in die er 1815 gewählt worden war, gehörte er zur Opposition gegen den Minister van Maanen. Auf seinen Platz in der Ersten Kammer verzichtete er, weil die Verhandlungen derselben nicht öffentlich waren. Er war vom 20. September 1815 bis 22. Mai 1819 Staatsminister der Niederlande, wurde dann aber wegen Kritik an der Finanzpolitik Wilhelm I. der Niederlande dieses Titels enthoben. Er ist einer von nur sechs niederländischen Staatsministern bei denen das der Fall war. Er starb am 5. August 1834 im Haag. Er schrieb: \"Über den Handel nach Indien\" (1801, 2 Bde.), \"Memoiren über den Handel nach Java\" (1804), \"Beiträge zur Staatshaushaltung des Königreichs der Niederlande\" (Delft 1818-29, 10 Bde.; 2.

He therefore served in the 35th, 36th and 37th Canadian Parliaments. Pillitteri is currently the longest serving consecutive Member of Parliament the Niagara Falls riding has ever had. Pillitteri left federal politics in 2004 and did not seek a fourth term in federal office. Rob Nicholson decided to put his name forward to run as the Conservative candidate in the next election only once he learned that Pillitteri had retired. Nicholson regained the riding that year.",

Popularly known as Ashai Sahib by his colleagues, political contemporaries and subordinates, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was the first Kashmiri Muslim to attain a bachelor's degree. In reward for his service and academic achievements, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah appointed Ghulam Ahmad Ashai as the first Registrar of the University of Kashmir, both for academic and administrative matters, from 1948 to 1953. He led the first convocation of the University of Kashmir at Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir) Park and was followed by a distinguished panel including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pro-Indian Sheikh Abdullah. Ashai's involvement with Kashmir University started when he was appointed as the Special Officer assigned with the responsibility of starting Kashmir's first university. Ashai spent the next two years touring universities across India building up strategic ties and relations with renowned and established universities. In the 1980 Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference government, in recognition of Ashai’s contributions as founding registrar designated the main road leading to the present university campus in Hazratbal as Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road. A commemorative plaque was installed at the entrance of the university, but it has since been removed. The family claims that illegal orders were given to have the plaque removed and the road christening annulled. However, according to official papers, the road is still legally named as \"Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road\".",

He co-authored \"Press Councils and Democracy\" which he presented to the 41st Canadian Regional Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in New Brunswick in July 2002 and was subsequently published in the Parliamentary Review. Appointed in 2000 to the All Party Committee on Tobacco Control, Addley was instrumental in developing recommendations which transformed Saskatchewan's approach to tobacco control including the precedent setting tobacco display ban which eliminated the last legal avenue for tobacco companies to advertise to children. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 in Saskatchewan's favour, the law was emulated across the country and around the world. In 2006 the Lung Association of Saskatchewan presented Addley its Award of Merit for outstanding service in promoting lung health in Saskatchewan. Appointed Legislative Secretary to the Premier on Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment in January 2005, his \"Healthy Choices in a Healthy Community Report\" resulted in the Premier's Project Hope strategy which was honoured by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) for leadership and commitment to the field of addiction. In October 2005 Addley was appointed to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Healthy Living Services and Minister Responsible for Seniors. In May 2007 his Cabinet duties were expanded to include Minister Responsible for Investment Saskatchewan Inc. and Minister Responsible for Information Services Corporation of Saskatchewan. He is married with three children.",

A Republican, he is a former member of the Utah State House. He formerly represented the state's 49th house district in Sandy and Cottonwood Heights. He formerly served as the Speaker of the House. Curtis was first elected to the State Legislature in 1994, defeating a fellow Republican in the primary. Curtis grew up in his district in Sandy and served a two-year LDS mission to New Zealand. He has worked for a private law firm; as a prosecutor for West Jordan City; and as staff counsel for County Mayor Nancy Workman. Curtis graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in accounting and then received a law degree from the University of Utah. Beginning in October 2008, Curtis was plagued by accusations from several former state employees who claimed that Curtis abused his government position to benefit his legal clients financially. One of these former employees, Doug Clark, claimed that Curtis cut funding and caused layoffs to anyone who opposed his plans to build a public transit facility in the midst of an ancient Native American settlement in Draper, Utah. Changing the location of the proposed facility would have kept land owners in the area from moving forward with subsequent development plans. Clark said that Curtis told him, *“Doug, I am the speaker of the House. If I want something, I get it. ... I want you to talk to DNR to figure out a way to get that road through there. I know this may sound a little strange. You may think it is unethical — because it probably is — because effectively I’m asking you as a state employee to work for me and do work for my law client.” On November 4, 2008, Curtis became the first sitting Speaker of the House in Utah to fail to win re-election in 40 years. Democrat Jay Seegmiller won by over 10% - nearly 1,400 votes. With this result, it became apparent that the public was fed up with Curtis's alleged abuse of power. For the 2009 legislative session, Curtis returned to Utah's Capitol Hill - not as a state representative - but as a lobbyist representing several large companies, including Intermountain Healthcare, UTA, Altria Group, parent company of Philip Morris.",

Gordon was born on June 20, 1927 to George and Lillian (Salat) St. Angelo in Huntingburg, Indiana. He served in the Navy at the end of World War II. He then attended North Central College, where he was active in student politics. He there met his future wife Beatrice Mae Larson, who was from Watertown, South Dakota. Gordon became active in Democratic Party politics in 1954. He was elected Dubois County Chairman in 1958. An early key supporter of then Senator John F. Kennedy, he became 8th District Chairman in 1960. St. Angelo worked on two presidential campaigns including holding the position of National Co-Chairman of Humphrey for President Committee. He was also manager of Roger Branigin's successful campaign for the governorship of Indiana in 1964. After managing the campaign of Governor Roger D. Branigan in 1964, Gordon was elected state Democratic Party Chairman, a position he held until 1974. His tenure was longer than that of any party chairman in Indiana. From 1974 to 1996, he was Vice-President of Community Development for the Lilly Endowment, and during this time was a vocal proponent for the development of free market economies in North and South America. Gordon's political reach extended beyond the state. He was Deputy Democratic Party National Chairman from June to November, 1968, when he helped manage the Hubert Humphrey presidential campaign. In 1974 Gordon left politics to become Senior Program Officer of community development at the Lilly Endowment, where he loved working for twenty three years. There he was instrumental in expanding the role of non-profits in public policy, with many positive civil- and individual-rights implications. His building of coalitions between non-profit think tanks was instrumental in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1973, he ran for National Democratic Party chairman, being narrowly defeated by Larry O'Brien. Gordon also served on the boards of the University of Indianapolis (1965-1993), St. Meinrad College, WFYI, the United Way, the Welfare Service League, the State Employment Commission, the Indiana Division of the National Civil Rights Commission, and the Indianapolis 500 Festival Committee. Starting with his work at the Lilly Endowment, Gordon and Beatty took special interest in historic New Harmony, Indiana which they visited often. He was appointed by Governor Evan Bayh to the New Harmony Commission and served on the board of the Robert Lee Blaffer Foundation until his death (Chairman, 1995-2006). He received honorary doctorates from the University of Indianapolis and the University of Southern Indiana. He received \"Sagamore of the Wabash\" awards for his service to Indiana from Governors Welsh, Branigan, Whitcomb, Bowen, Orr, Bayh and Daniels. In 1996, St. Angelo helped create a foundation with Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman and his wife, Rose Friedman to promote and help establish educational choice in America. He served as President & CEO of the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation for School Choice until 2009. He was succeeded by Robert Enlow. Though he started his career in the Democratic party, he was a supporter of many Republican candidates since the mid-seventies. For example, he endorsed Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, a Republican, for both of his gubernatorial campaigns. St. Angelo died on October 18, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana.",

Garrett was raised in Maine and moved back to California in 1969, where he later attended Beverly Hills High School and California State College at Bakersfield. He moved to Georgia in 1991 and currently serves as the secretary of the Cobb County Libertarian Party. After serving in a number of roles with the both county and state Libertarian organizations in Georgia, Hayes sought and won the party nomination for governor in 2002 and again in 2006. Hayes received 2.3% of the vote in 2003 and 3.8% of the vote in 2006. In his second run at office, Hayes set several benchmarks for third party politics in the state, beginning with being the first Libertarian to run twice for governor. Hayes’s campaign was the first Libertarian gubernatorial campaign to produce and run television advertisements in Georgia. He also garnered the highest polling numbers to date for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in the state, polling as high as 9% in one non-partisan poll, leading to press speculation that Hayes might force an unprecedented runoff electionbetween incumbent Republican Sonny Perdue and Democratic rival Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor. Though a runoff did not in fact result, Hayes still gathered both the highest number and the highest percentage of votes for a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate in Georgia. Hayes currently co-hosts a weekly Libertarian-themed political radio talk show on radio station WHIE in Griffin, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta.",

Il étudie à Albany puis la médecine auprès de Theodric Romeyn Beck (1791-1855) au Fairfield Medical School et manifeste un fort intérêt pour la botanique. En février 1828, son père meurt brutalement. Il s’oriente alors vers des études de droit auprès de John Canfield Spencer (1788-1855) et est admis au barreau en 1831. L’année suivante, il se marie avec la fille de John Spencer, Laura Catherine, union dont naîtra neuf enfants. Il s’installe à Buffalo en 1836. Clinton y fonde un cabinet d’avocat et participe à l’organisation d’une délégation locale du parti démocrate. Il participe à la campagne de Martin Van Buren (1782-1862) en 1838. En 1842, il est élu maire de Buffalo. En 1852, il devient président du conseil de l’université de Buffalo.

  "text" : "Gerrit Jan (Gert) Schutte (Nieuwpoort, 24 mei 1939) is een Nederlands politicus en voormalig ambtenaar. Nadat hij de mulo had afgerond begon hij in 1956 zijn werkzame leven als gemeenteambtenaar bij de gemeente Giessenburg. Vervolgens werkte hij bij de gemeenten Schoonhoven, Elst en Nieuwpoort. In 1968 kwam hij als plaatsvervangend gemeentesecretaris bij de gemeente Zeist terecht waaraan hij tot 1981 verbonden zou blijven.Schutte volgde van 1956 tot 1965 diverse opleidingen op het gebied van de lagere overheid. Van 1969 tot 1974 gaf hij zelf les in het gemeenterecht aan een dergelijk opleidingsinstituut. Van 1974 tot 1978 zat hij voor het Gereformeerd Politiek Verbond (GPV) in de Provinciale Staten van de provincie Utrecht. In 1981 deed hij voor diezelfde partij zijn intrede in de Tweede Kamer. Tot 1989 vormde hij een eenmansfractie, daarna maakte hij tot 2001 met Eimert van Middelkoop de fractie van het GPV uit. Al die jaren was hij ook fractievoorzitter.Schutte stond bekend als 'het staatsrechtelijke geweten van de Kamer'. Hij vatte dit op als dat andere Kamerleden te weinig oog voor de staatsrechtelijke kant van het politieke bedrijf zouden hebben. Sinds 2001 was hij lid van de Kiesraad. Van 2003 tot 2005 leidde hij een onderzoek naar de HBO-fraude. Begin 2005 was hij lid van de commissie die zich bezighield met de voorbereiding van het referendum over de Europese Grondwet en in de tweede helft van 2006 leidde hij een onderzoek naar een ongeval in de binnenstad van Utrecht waarbij tijdens een concert een werftrap was bezweken waardoor er een dode was gevallen en meer dan twintig mensen gewonden raakten. Gert Schutte die ook nog columnist bij het Friesch Dagblad en de Persunie is geweest, is lid van de Gereformeerde Kerken vrijgemaakt.",

In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for Mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 election but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June.

Bikman has extensive business experience, having successfully owned and managed an oilfield service company for 25 years. He cofounded and led ChopStix Restaurants from 2006 to 2010 and ChopStix International Franchising from 2010 to 2012. Bikman has been a sessional instructor at the University of Lethbridge’s faculty of management and at Lethbridge College. He has also served intermittently as a member of the Chinook Arch Regional Library Board and as a scout leader in the village of Stirling. Bikman has been a critic of the Alberta government's decision to cut funding supports for persons with developmental disabilities in the 2013-2014 budget. After the 2012 election, he faced some controversy when, in an interview with CTV News shortly after the his election, he attributed his party's defeat to urban voters, who largely remained loyal to the governing Progressive Conservatives, possessing less \"common sense\" than the rural voters who turned to the Wildrose Party. Bikman was first elected in the 2012 provincial election, as part of the Wildrose Party caucus. On December 17, 2014, he was one of nine Wildrose MLAs who crossed the floor to join the Progressive Conservative caucus. Bikman failed to earn the PC nomination as a candidate of his riding for the May 5, 2015 election.",

As Secretary for the Minority, Myrick is chief procedural advisor to the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator Harry Reid, and supervises the minority's reaction to the day-to-day Senate schedule. In so doing, he often works with the Secretary for the Majority, Laura Dove. Roll Call reporters and editors have repeatedly cited Myrick among leading Capitol Hill staffers. Myrick helped manage Senate passage of, among other things, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, the 2013 Farm Bill, and the immigration reform bill of 2013. Myrick served as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Chief of Staff in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In this post, Myrick oversaw the Majority Leader’s staff and was responsible for helping craft policy, develop strategy, and conduct outreach on behalf of the Majority Leader and Democratic Caucus. The Senate elected Myrick Secretary for the Majority on January 5, 2011. After the Republicans took back the majority in the 2014 elections, Myrick moved from Secretary for the Majority to Secretary for the Minority. Myrick joined Senator Reid’s office in 2003, when Reid, then Senate Minority Whip, asked him to serve as his Floor Counsel. In this position, Myrick quickly became one of Senator Reid’s top aides, and in 2005 he was named Deputy Chief of Staff. Reid is the third Senate Democratic Leader for whom Myrick has worked. He started his Senate career as an intern for Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell while attending the University of Maine. After graduating, he moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a staff assistant in Senator Mitchell’s office and as a member of Mitchell’s Cloakroom staff. While working in the Democratic Cloakroom, Myrick attended night classes at the Washington College of Law at American University, earning a J.D. in 1995. When Mitchell retired in 1995, Gary joined the Senate Floor Staff under incoming Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. Myrick lives in Arlington, Virginia, with his wife, Lauren, and their son, Henry.",

  "text" : "Count Per Brahe the Younger (18 February 1602 – 2 September 1680) was a Swedish soldier and statesman. He was a Privy Councillor from 1630 and Lord High Steward from 1640. Brahe was born on Rydboholm (now in Österåker Municipality) in Uppland. He was the grandson of Per Brahe the Elder (1520–1590), one of Gustavus Vasa's Privy Councillors, created count of Visingsborg by King Eric XIV, known also as the continuator of Peder Svart's chronicle of Gustavus, and author of Oeconomia in 1585, a manual for young noblemen. Per Brahe the younger, after completing his education by several years’ travel abroad, became in 1626 chamberlain to Gustavus Adolphus, whose lasting friendship he gained. He fought with distinction in Prussia during the last three years of the Polish War (1626–1629) and also, as colonel of a regiment of horse, in 1630 in Germany. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632 his military yielded to his political activity. He had been elected president or Lantmarskalk in the Riksdag of 1629, and in the following year was created a Privy Councillor. In 1635 he conducted the negotiations for an armistice with Poland (Treaty of Stuhmsdorf). In 1637–1640 and again in 1648–1654 he was Governor General in Finland, to which country he rendered inestimable services by his wise and provident rule. He reformed the whole administration, introduced a postal system, founded ten new towns, improved and developed commerce and agriculture, and very greatly promoted education. In 1640 he opened the Royal Academy of Turku, of which he was the founder, and first chancellor. Still today the expression \"Kreivin aikaan\", or \"at Count's Time\" in the Finnish language means \"at the correct/good time\". The base of his statue in Turku bears the inscription \"I was well pleased with the land and the land with me\". After the death of King Charles X in 1660, Brahe, as Lord High Steward, became one of the regents of Sweden for the second time (he had held a similar office during the minority of Queen Christina, 1632–1644), and during the difficult year 1660 he had entire control of both foreign and domestic affairs. He died on 2 September 1680 at his castle Bogesund in Uppland. He also held the castles Visingsborg at Visingsö and Brahehus on the mainland by Gränna, where during his lifetime he had held more than regal pomp. The town of Raahe (Swedish: Brahestad) in Finland is named after him.",

He was born in Östergötland and was at one time chairman of the Moderate Youth League district there. He studied law in Uppsala 1968–71. In 1971, he was elected national chairman of the Moderate Youth League and served until 1976, when he was elected to the Riksdag for Östergötland. In 1986, he became secretary general of the Moderate Party. He stayed in the post until 1991, when the Moderate Party won the election and Carl Bildt became Prime Minister of Sweden. Unckel was then appointed Minister of Education. In that position, he spearheaded the educational reforms that revolutionised the Swedish education system. Among other things, students were allowed to choose among the local schools. After the loss in the election in 1994, Unckel became the party spokesman on labour policy. In 1998 he became chairman of the Committee on the Constitution and one year later he was appointed leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group. The election in 2002 was disastrous for the Moderate Party and several senior figures had to resign from the board of the party. Per Unckel was one of them. He was seen as a part of the old regime - the so-called \"Bunker\" around Carl Bildt, together with the likes of Anders Björk and Gunnar Hökmark. His old Moderate Youth League district, however, paid their respects by electing him honorary chairman. In 2003, he was appointed secretary-general of the Nordic Council of Ministers and retired from Swedish politics. He served until December 2006. He later served as the Chairman of the Governing Board of the European Humanities University. Unckel died on 20 September 2011 from cancer, aged 63.",

Dzhaparidze, étnicamente georgiano, se unió a los bolcheviques en 1898, partido en el que se ganó el apodo de Aliosha (Alesha), trasladándose entonces a Bakú, capital azerí. Ayudó a fundar el Hummet, partido socialista musulmán y fue elegido delegado de la Unión Caucásica del Partido Obrero Socialdemócrata de Rusia (POSDR) en el III Congreso del POSDR celebrado en Londres en 1905. Durante su vida política fue muchas veces encarcelado o exiliado por sus actividades anti-zaristas en el Imperio Ruso. Tras la Revolución de Febrero de 1917 se convirtió en miembro del Comité Regional del Cáucaso, uniéndose a la Comuna de Bakú y siendo uno de los legendarios 26 Comisarios de Bakú. Desempeñó varias responsabilidades en la comuna. Dzhaparidze, junto a Stepán Shaumián, Meshadi Azizbekov, Iván Fioletov y otros comisarios, trataron de expandir la ideología comunista a través de todo el Cáucaso. Poco después de la caída de la comuna, la noche del 20 de septiembre de 1918, fue ejecutado por un pelotón de fusilamiento en una remota localidad entre las estaciones de Pereval y Ajcha-Kuima del Ferrocarril Trans-Caspio junto a otros comisarios. Dzhaparidze fue uno de los cuatro principales comisarios que ganaron un notable estatus en la Unión Soviética como héroe caído de la Revolución Rusa. Una calle de Sochi (Rusia) aún se llama en su honor y posee un pequeño busto en Moscú. Su monumento en Bakú, capital de Azerbaiyán, fue demolido en 2009.",

  "text" : "Peter William Jenkins (born April 30, 1944) is a Canadian politician, who has served as deputy premier and health minister in the territorial government of the Yukon, and as mayor of Dawson City. Jenkins, a hotelier, first ran for the territorial legislature in 1989 but lost to NDP cabinet minister Art Webster. In that vote, Jenkins' campaign manager was future Liberal Premier Pat Duncan. Prior to entering provincial politics, he served as mayor of Dawson City from 1980 to 1994, earning the nickname \"Pirate Pete\" after he registered for satellite television service under the name of a dead local pioneer and then redistributed the television signals to residents of Dawson City for free. Jenkins was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1996 election in Klondike for the Yukon Party. He defended his seat in the 2000 election, the only Yukon Party member to do so. He assumed the leadership of the party after the election. He held the position as sole MLA and leader until May and June 2002, when Dennis Fentie crossed the floor from the NDP and won the leadership party's leadership, defeating Jenkins and former party president Darcy Tkachuk on the first ballot. He defended his seat successfully in the 2002 general election and was sworn into cabinet in November, serving as Health Minister and Deputy Premier until November 28, 2005 when he resigned from the party and cabinet. Jenkins said this was because \"the heart and soul of my community has been ripped out by the inefficiences of government at the municipal level, the territorial level.\" Fentie told the press at the time it was due to the ongoing loans file, which involved Jenkins owing $300,000 to the territorial government he was a part of. This eventually was cleared off the books in March 2006. Jenkins sat as an Independent MLA in the Assembly until dissolution, and chose not to run in the 2006 general election. Jenkins later ran for another term as mayor of Dawson City in the 2009 municipal election, defeating incumbent John Steins by seven votes. He was defeated in the 2012 municipal election by Wayne Potoroka.",

  "text" : "Patrick A. Nash (March 2, 1863 – October 6, 1943) was a political boss in the early and mid-twentieth century in Chicago, which is in Cook County, Illinois, United States. He was in large part responsible for consolidating elements of the Cook County Democratic Party into a political machine. He evolved from a local sewage contractor to a political boss by carefully selecting his political allies. His prominence stems from the death of Anton Cermak and his political career is intertwined with that of Edward Joseph Kelly. The success of this machine was attributed to its decision to be more inclusive than its predecessors. This meant that Nash had success at dealing with a variety of politicians such as William L. Dawson.",

On September 14, 2011, Governor Mark Dayton appointed Carruthers as a judge to the Minnesota Fourth District Court. Carruthers came to Minnesota in 1961 with his parents, who were Canadian citizens. He graduated from St. Anthony Village High School and the University of Minnesota before attending the University of Minnesota Law School. He worked for several years as an attorney before seeking public office. He also served on the Metropolitan Council from 1983–1986. He won election to the House in 1986 from Brooklyn Center, representing District 47B, which included portions of Hennepin County. He also maintained a private practice and served as prosecutor for the city of Shorewood during this same time period. While in the House, Carruthers served as chair of the Metropolitan Affairs Subcommittee on Government Structure, the Local Government and Metropolitan Affairs Subcommittee on Metro Affairs, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Data Privacy, the Rules and Legislative Administration Committee, and the Rules and Legislative Administration Subcommittee on Administration. In 1993, Carruthers was chosen to be Majority Leader when Irv Anderson became Speaker. He served as majority leader during the next two legislative sessions and became chair of the Rules and Legislative Administration Committee. When Anderson stepped down from the House leadership in 1997, he succeeded him as Speaker. He remained in that position until 1999, when the DFL majority was defeated by the Republican Party, and Steve Sviggum succeeded him as Speaker. He served one more term in the House before retiring in 2001.",

Krieger. Being 30 years old at the time of his election, Jordan is the youngest mayor in the history of Jersey City. After graduating from medical school in 1968, Jordan ran a drug rehabilitation center in Jersey City. His political involvement began when he joined a local reform group called the Community Action Council. Jordan was first elected as a reform candidate in a special election following the resignation of Thomas J. Whelan after Whelan's conviction for extortion and conspiracy. Jordan's election was hailed as an end to machine control of Jersey City politics, and was credited to support from a large number of young voters. He was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1973. Jordan was the first mayor to propose a major redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront. During his term, Jordan appointed Shirley Tolentino as the first African-American woman to serve as a full-time municipal court judge in New Jersey. In 1977, Jordan simultaneously ran for reelection in Jersey City's non-partisan May election and for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Jersey, with the primary held in June. Jordan used an aggressive television advertising campaign that was estimated to cost up to $200,000. After losing the mayoral election, he withdrew from the gubernatorial primary and supported incumbent Governor Brendan Byrne. Jordan's campaign later received a $30,000 campaign contribution from Byrne's campaign, allowing him to retire 25% of his campaign debt. Jordan retired from politics and returned to his medical career following his withdrawal from the primary. He later served as the Chairman of Emergency Medicine at Trinitas Hospital in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Jordan currently serves as a member of the New Jersey State Board of Human Services and served as its chairman from 1991 until 1996. He is also the treasurer of the State Board of Medical Examiners.",

He was the author of several books of military history, including his controversial work The Donkeys (1961), which is considered to have inspired the musical satire Oh, What a Lovely War! Clark became known for his flamboyance, wit and irreverence. Norman Lamont called him \"the most politically incorrect, outspoken, iconoclastic and reckless politician of our times\". He is particularly remembered for his three-volume diary, a candid account of political life under Thatcher and a moving description of the weeks preceding his death, when he continued to write until he could no longer focus on the page. Clark was a passionate supporter of animal rights, joining activists in demonstrations at Dover against live export, and outside the House of Commons in support of Animal Liberation Front hunger-striker Barry Horne. When he died after radiation therapy for a brain tumour, his family said Clark wanted it to be stated that he had \"gone to join Tom and the other dogs.\"",

His opposition to Canadian confederation dissolved when he didn't get the appointment he expected as Attorney-General in the Anti-Confederate Party's government. Wetmore crossed the floor and joined the Confederation Party which formed the government in 1866. When New Brunswick joined Canada in 1867 many prominent pro-Confederation politicians assumed positions in the Canadian House of Commons, the courts or other offices. Wetmore was able to assume the leadership of the remaining Confederation Party forces in the legislature becoming Premier in 1867. Wetmore's government helped finance extensions to rail lines in the province. His government also incorporated the College of Saint Joseph and granted full property rights to all married women living apart from, or deserted by, their husbands. On May 25, 1870 he retired from politics to accept a position on the New Brunswick Supreme Court.",

  "text" : "Andrew Damien Wilkie (born 8 November 1961, Tamworth, New South Wales, Australia) is an Australian politician and independent federal member for Denison. He has been an army officer and an intelligence analyst. In 2003 Wilkie resigned from his position in Australia's Office of National Assessments intelligence agency in the lead up to the Iraq War, because he said he feared the humanitarian consequences of invasion such as Saddam using his Weapons of Mass Destruction, or assisting terrorists. Following his resignation he said: Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.\" He opposed Australia's contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government and ran for Parliament against John Howard as a Green's Candidate in 2004. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a \"lie\". Since 2003 he has been active in Australian politics. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences. Wilkie finished first on the primary vote at the 2013 federal election and increased his margin.",

As mayor, he oversaw the city's purchase of its first piece of fire-fighting equipment and appointed Denis Swenie as fire chief. In 1850, he became one of the original trustees of Northwestern University. He moved to Waukegan, Illinois in 1856.

Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896. Arthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900. Sewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.",

  "text" : "Alexander Turk (March 5, 1906 – January 1, 1988) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1953 to 1958. Born in Larne, Northern Ireland, the son of Nathaniel Turk and Mary O'Lynn, Turk came to Canada with his family in 1910, and was educated at Lord Selkirk School. In 1931, he married Annie Owens. He was a wrestling promoter and president of the Giants Baseball Club, and was known in politics as a charismatic showman. Some credit him with introducing modern professional wrestling to Manitoba in 1946 with his company, the NWA-affiliated Alex Turk Promotions. In later years, he would promote Verne Gagne, Pat O'Connor, Bruno Sammartino, Haystacks Calhoun, Lou Thesz and others in the region. He was eventually pushed out of business by competition from the American Wrestling Association. Turk's election to the Manitoba legislature was somewhat unexpected. In the 1953 election, he ran as a candidate of the Liberal-Progressive Party in Winnipeg North, a constituency dominated by the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the communist Labour Progressive Party. He finished seventh out of eleven candidates on the multi-member constituency's first count, behind two other Liberal-Progressive candidates. He did well on transfers, however, and defeated fellow Liberal-Progressive J.M. Kozoriz for the final position. In the legislature, he served as a backbench supporter of Douglas Campbell's government. Turk was on the left-wing of the Liberal-Progressive Party. In 1954, he was the only member of the government caucus to support a CCF bill calling for comprehensive health insurance. The following year, he was the only Liberal-Progressive MLA to endorse a bill calling for progressive prison reforms. Winnipeg's multi-member constituencies were eliminated in the 1958 election, and Turk lost to Steve Peters of the CCF by 856 votes in the newly created riding of Elmwood. He ran again in the 1959 election, but finished third. After leaving provincial politics, Turk was elected to the Winnipeg City Council. Though a member of the conservative Civic Election Committee, he again showed himself to be a progressive representative on issues relating to workers, pensioners and the handicapped, and often voted with the CCF group. In 1964, he lost his seat on council to another CEC candidate.",

In 2006, he began a private prosecution against Michael Barrymore for alleged drugs and drink offences committed on the night Stuart Lubbock was found dead at the entertainer's home. Bennett co-wrote a book with Terry Lubbock, the father of Stuart Lubbock, Not Awight: Getting Away With Murder, explaining their theory that Stuart Lubbock died as a result of a violent attack on him which Barrymore and his associates that night covered up. He has also campaigned against the parents of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared while on a family holiday in Portugal in 2007. He asserted that they should have been prosecuted for child neglect and accused them of covering up what happened to their daughter, a charge which ultimately led to the family successfully pursuing legal action against him.",

He was Deputy Chairman of the State Duma's Committee on Credit Organizations and Financial Markets, and a member of the LDPR Supreme Council.From 1991 to 1993, he was active as a music manager for Aleksey Afanasiev and the bands Bravo and Mirage. He ran for mayor of Moscow in 1999 and again in 2003, unsuccessfully both times. Mitrofanov served in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union. He holds degrees in international relations from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and from the USA-Canada Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 2005 he made and released a controversial erotic movie titled Yuliya, which portrayed two people called Misha and Yuliya in various sex scenes who resembled then Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko and President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili. He is also known for his strident nationalist comments. For instance in November 2008 he claimed that the economic crisis of 2008 will shut down Ukraine’s industry and that its collapse would make Ukraine a part of the Russian Federation. He left the LDPR in August 2007 to join the A Just Russia party led by Sergei Mironov. Opinion polls at the time suggested that the LDPR would fail to gain representation in the Duma following the election in December 2007, while Fair Russia was expected to gain seats. The LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Mitrofanov's departure would actually improve Mitrofanov's former party's image. Mitrofanov stood as the top candidate for the Fair Russia federal list in Penza at the Russian legislative election, 2007. Ironically, he failed to be re-elected, ending a political career that had lasted since 1993, while the LDPR beat Fair Russia winning a larger share of the national vote. In 2011 he was elected to the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sixth on the list of party A Just Russia from Vologda region. A member of the Just Russia faction.

As Deputy Speaker, he was the highest ranking African American in the New York State Legislature. During his political career he became a political foe of Western New York politician James D. Griffin and of New York State Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. He was a founding member of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. At the national level, Eve was once one of three alternates to the 15-person 1984 Democratic Party Platform Committee. Eve was an observer and negotiator during the 1971 Attica Prison riot and the first official to enter the facility to hear the demands of the inmates. An advocate for liberal causes such as economic development, education, job training and development, social services, crime prevention and parole reform, day care and housing, Eve was also a leader in the movement to legislate Harriet Tubman Day as a New York State holiday.

After working for the World Bank and in the private sector, he purchased a farm where he established a commercial vineyard and co-founded the Virginia Wineries Association. In 2002, Governor Mark Warner named Weed 5th District Trustee for the Virginia Land Conservation Trust Fund. In 2006, Weed faced competition for the Democratic Party nomination. Former Roanoke City Manager Bern Ewert argued that Weed had been beaten \"like a drum\" in 2004 and would probably lose again. Nevertheless, on May 20, 2006, Weed was chosen as the Democratic nominee by a 114-73 vote of the delegates to the party convention. In Weed's 2006 campaign, he emphasized the need for better treatment of military veterans. One of his campaign proposals was to establish a college for disabled veterans in the district. In both his campaigns, he advocated withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.",

He was encouraged to pursue a New York Senate Seat, but was not nominated by the Democratic Party when the seat first became available in a special election. However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican.",

Taib was also the President of Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), which is part of the Barisan Nasional coalition. He is of ethnic Melanau descent. Taib is informally known as Pak Uban, which translates into \"white-haired uncle\". Among Chinese speaking communities he is known as Pek Moh (白毛) which means \"white hair\". Another informal name for him, in reference to the British Brooke family that ruled Sarawak as White Rajahs in the 19th and early 20th century, is the \"last white rajah\" or \"white-haired rajah\". Holding the post of Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1981 to 2014, he was the longest serving Chief Minister in Malaysia. He assumed the Chief Minister post at the age of 45. Being a member of the Malaysian Parliament for 38 years, Taib is also the second longest-serving parliamentarian in Malaysia after Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Taib and his wider family are regularly accused of corruption and personally benefiting from Sarawak's natural and economic resources. On 12 February 2014, Taib handed over his resignation letter to the Governor of Sarawak to vacate his chief minister post, officially ending his 33 years of chief ministership. His former brother-in-law, Adenan Satem, succeeded him as Chief Minister with effect from 1 March 2014. At the same time, he received the official credentials as the 7th Sarawak Head of State from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at Istana Negara on 28 February, and officially took the oath of office on the following day. He became the second Sarawakian (after his uncle, Abdul Rahman Ya'kub) to be appointed as the Governor after formally relinquishing the post of Chief Minister.",

August 2014 Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrats der Ukraine. Er war Mitbegründer der rechtsextremen Sozial-Nationalen Partei der Ukraine, des Vorläufers der heutigen Swoboda-Partei und war zeitweise auch in der Führung der nationalistischen Organisation Patriot der Ukraine aktiv. In seiner politischen Laufbahn wechselte er mehrfach die Parteizugehörigkeit, bei den Parlamentswahlen 2012 kandidierte er auf der Liste von Julija Tymoschenkos Vaterlandspartei und wurde erneut in die Werchowna Rada gewählt. Während der Euromaidan-Proteste galt Parubij als „Kommandeur des Maidan“, wobei er eng mit dem Führer des Rechten Sektors, Dmytro Jarosch, kooperierte. Bei der Bildung der Übergangsregierung Jazenjuk im Februar 2014 erhielt Parubij das Amt des Vorsitzenden des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates der Ukraine, von dem er am 7. August 2014 zurücktrat. Während der Krise in der Ukraine 2014 leitete er von April bis August, als der Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates, die Operationen im Osten der Ukraine, die als „Anti-Terror-Operation“ bezeichnet wurden. Während dieser Zeit sprach sich Parubij für die Einführung einer Visumpflicht für russische Staatsbürger aus. Jazenjuk nahm gegenüber der Frage der Visa-Regelung in Brüssel eine vorsichtigere Haltung an, angesichts der Tatsache, dass eine große Zahl der Bürger, in erster Linie im Süden und Osten des Landes, interessiert seien an der Beibehaltung des visumfreien Verkehrs nach Russland, da sie dort arbeiten oder Familie hätten. Bei der Parlamentswahl 2014 kandidiert er auf Platz vier der Volksfront. Nach der Wahl wurde er stellvertretender Parlamentsvorsitzender der Werchowna Rada. Am 14. April 2016 wurde Andrij Parubij in Nachfolge des neuen Ministerpräsidenten Wolodymyr Hrojsman mit 284 Abgeordnetenstimmen zum neuen Parlamentspräsidenten der Werchowna Rada gewählt.",

  "text" : "Arjan El Fassed (Vlaardingen, 5 augustus 1973) is een voormalig Tweede Kamerlid voor GroenLinks. Hij stond negende op de kandidatenlijst van GroenLinks voor de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2010 en was daarmee verkozen. Op 17 juni 2010 werd hij geïnstalleerd. Hij was woordvoerder ontwikkelingssamenwerking, defensie, landbouw en digitale agenda. El Fassed werkte daarvoor bij Oxfam International, waar hij interim-hoofd humanitaire campagnes was. Sinds 2002 werkte hij bij Oxfam Novib als lobbyist en beleidsadviseur op het gebied van humanitaire hulp en mensenrechten. Hij hield zich met name bezig met internationale conflicten en mensenrechten. Daarvoor werkte hij bij verschillende internationale ngo's: Tussen 1996 en 1998 werkte hij als onderzoeker bij CPRS, waar hij zich bezighield met democratische transitie. Daarna was hij onderzoeker bij de ombudsman PICCR, dat zich bezighoudt met corruptie en mensenrechten in de Palestijnse gebieden. Tussen 1998 en 1999 was hij projectmedewerker bij het Onderhouds-Behoeftebepaling en Verwervings Traject van de Nederlandse landmacht. Tussen 1999 en 2001 was hij beleidsadviseur bij ICCO waar hij zich bezighield met de Hoorn van Afrika en het Midden-Oosten. Tussen 2000 en 2002 werkte hij bij de Palestijnse mensenrechtenorganisatie LAW. Over die periode schreef hij het boek \"Niet iedereen kan stenen gooien\". Terug in Nederland werkte hij als senior lobbyist voor Oxfam Novib en was hij interim-hoofd humanitaire campagnes voor Oxfam International. Tussen 1991 en 1996 studeerde El Fassed politieke wetenschappen aan de Universiteit Leiden, waar hij zich specialiseerde in internationale en vergelijkende politicologie. Daarvoor bezocht hij het Groen van Prinsterer Lyceum en de Van der Schaar-school. El Fassed ontplooide een aantal internetinitiatieven. Als een actie om aandacht te krijgen voor vluchtelingenkampen in de Palestijnse gebieden, kocht hij een straatnaam in een Palestijns vluchtelingenkamp die hij naar zijn eigen Twitteraccount noemde. Ook was hij voorzitter van Sendamessage.nl, een stichting die foto's van door Palestijnen op muren gespoten boodschappen verkoopt. Sendamessage.nl kreeg aandacht van CNN, Al Jazeera en Time Magazine. El Fassed werd in november 2010 bekritiseerd omdat neonazi's samenwerkten met Al-Awda, een mede door hem opgerichte organisatie. Electronic Intifada, een andere mede door El Fassed opgerichte organisatie, kwam onder kritiek te staan doordat deze gefinancierd werd door de Nederlandse hulporganisatie ICCO terwijl op de website van de organisatie de Israëlische overheid nazipraktijken wordt verweten en het zionisme gelijk wordt gesteld met de Holocaust. Sinds 2009 is El Fassed niet meer betrokken bij Electronic Intifada. Arjan El Fassed heeft een Palestijnse vader en een Nederlandse moeder. Hij is getrouwd en heeft drie kinderen. Zijn oom aan vaderskant was burgemeester van Nabloes. Deze raakte zwaargewond bij een aanslag. In 2008 verscheen zijn boek Niet iedereen kan stenen gooien: Een Nederlandse Palestijn op zoek naar zijn wortels en identiteit, over zijn eigen familiegeschiedenis en het conflict in het Midden-Oosten. Bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen 2012 stond El Fassed op plaats nummer 7 van de kandidatenlijst. Als gevolg van de verkiezingsnederlaag van GroenLinks keerde hij niet terug in de Kamer. Op 8 april 2013 is hij in dienst getreden als directeur van de Open State Foundation.",

  "text" : "Alex M. Torpey (born August 10, 1987 in New York City) is a non-party affiliated American politician and consultant. Torpey was elected as the 48th Village President (equivalent of mayor) of South Orange, New Jersey in May 2011 for a four-year term by a 14-vote margin. At the age of 23 years at the time of being sworn in (May 16, 2011), he was the youngest Village President in South Orange’s history, and at that time the youngest serving mayor in the state of New Jersey. Torpey was one of the youngest mayors in the United States to oversee a municipality the size of South Orange, which has 16,000 full-time residents plus approximately 7,000 Seton Hall University students at their South Orange campus. On June 20, 2014, nearly 1 year before his first term was over, he announced he would not seek re-election to a second term. Torpey's term ended May 18 when he swore-in South Orange's second-youngest, and first female, Village President, Sheena Collum, whom he supported in the election, and had served with for two previous years on South Orange's governing body. Torpey was born in New York City, and raised first in Maplewood, then South Orange, and is an alumnus of Columbia High School (2005). Torpey completed his undergraduate degree in Political Science, American Government and Law at Hampshire College, while also serving as student government president. He also holds a Master of Public Administration in emergency management from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. Torpey founded is a managing partner of Veracity Media LLC, a social-impact consulting firm. Torpey also founded a nonpartisan initiative, Rethink Leadership, to help encourage young people to consider elected office and local government as a way to become more involved and active in their government and public policy issues. Torpey was named a 2013-2014 James Madison Fellow at the bi-partisan Millennial Action Project for his work in encouraging young people towards civics participation. Torpey also serves on the advisory board of the New Jersey chapter of the New Leaders Council and on Sustainable Jersey's Community Information and Citizen Engagement Initiative. Starting in the fall semester of 2014, Torpey was appointed adjunct faculty of governance and technology at Seton Hall University, co-teaching with Dr. Matt Hale, master of public administration students on topics of collaboration and technology innovation in government. Torpey’s philosophy of governance relies heavily on the use of technology, media and communications to increase interactivity, transparency and efficiency towards the ends of better government. He has written and lectured on these topics frequently prior to his election and since. While in office, Torpey primarily worked on a number of fiscal, economic development, public safety, transparency, community engagement and organizational development initiatives, in addition to petitioning utility companies for better preparedness efforts after Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy; along with several other New Jersey mayors, performing one of the first legal same-sex marriages in the state in 2013 (as well as being a vocal advocate on the issue); advocating for better open data standards, a tuition-credit program for volunteer first responders and updates to homelessness and veterans support programs. In addition to his official municipal responsibilities as Village President, Torpey served as a member and EMT of the South Orange Rescue Squad. Torpey also served as South Orange's municipal Office of Emergency Management Coordinator.",

Ryan led the party to 5.9 per cent of the popular vote in the 1974 provincial election, the first full election in which it competed, but did not succeed in winning any seats. Ryan won 14.6 per cent of the vote in his own riding. In the 1978 provincial election, the party's popular vote declined to 0.9 per cent provincewide, and the party was able to field just five candidates.

He was a Member of Parliament from 1960 to 1991, being elected as a candidate of the left wing AKEL party. He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) from 1943 to 1986. His contribution to the development of labour relations and labour legislation in Cyprus has been crucial and many consider him the person with the most significant role in shaping the trade union movement on the island. Legislations such as the Social Security Law of Cyprus in 1956 (Πρώτος Νόμος Περί Κοινωνικών Ασφαλίσεων, Νόμος Αρ. 31 του 1956), the introduction of the Cost of Living Allowance, the eight-hour working day and the forty hour working week, legislation on unfair dismissal and the labour disputes tribunals, the shaping of the collective agreements in many sectors of economic activity as well as the tripartite cooperation between trade unions, employers’ organisations and government all bear his mark. He first joined the outlawed Communist Party of Cyprus in 1939 and became a member of left wing AKEL party in 1941 upon its foundation.He was Secretary General of the Pancyprian Trade Union Committee, the first coordinating body of trade unions in Cyprus and the precursor of PEO. He was accused along with all the Committee members for sedition and insurrection against the Colonial order and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in 1946. This was a major political trial of the colonial era and his address to the court was a memorable anti-colonial statement. Andreas Ziartides participated as the Cypriot representative in the founding congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) held in 1945 in London. He served on the General Council and the Executive Committee of the WFTU for many years and was its Vice President for a while. In the early nineties he, along with others in the AKEL leadership, disagreed with the line followed by the Party and was dismissed from his leadership position. This led to his and others’ departure from AKEL and the formation of ADESOK, in Greek: ΑΔΗΣΟΚ (Ανανεωτικό Δημοκρατικό Σοσιαλιστικό Κόμμα), a reformist leftist party. ADESOK was later merged with Free Democrats Movement (founded by former President of Cyprus George Vassiliou) and formed a new party named United Democrats. A form of interview/biography of Andreas Ziartides was authored by Panikos Paionides in his book \"Ανδρέας Ζιαρτίδης: Χωρίς φόβο και πάθος\" Television interviews of Andreas Ziartides were documented by journalist Pavlos Pavlou (Greek: Παύλος Παύλου) in his book Dimosia Katathesi (Greek: Δημόσια Κατάθεση).",

  "text" : "Alvaro Farinacci (born September 11, 1944) is a Canadian politician. Elected as a municipal councillor for the first time back in 1983, Alvaro Farinacci quickly succeeded in gaining the confidence of the Mayor and Council, as reflected in his appointment to the Executive Committee the following year. Due to his vast experience as a certified real estate broker and member of the Board of Directors of the Montreal Real Estate Board for 17 years, he was entrusted with the responsibility of a number of matters relating to urban development. At the same time, Mr. Farinacci also held various other positions over those years, including chairman of the Commission de l'aménagement du territoire et du développement économique (land use planning and economic development committee), member of the Comité de toponymie (toponymy committee) and, for 16 years, was a member of LaSalle's Comité consultatif d'urbanisme (urban planning advisory committee), where he in fact served as that committee's first chairman. Mr. Farinacci also very significantly contributed to LaSalle's economic growth. He was a founding member of the Corporation de développement économique de LaSalle (CDEL) in 1984 and then served as CDEL's chairman for a number of years. He was also one of the founders of the Comité de sécurité industrielle (committee on safety in the workplace). Recalling that the Mayor had given him the mandate \"to develop a structure designed to arouse interest in order to promote and attract investments to LaSalle\", Alvaro Farinacci mentioned how very proud he was of his contribution to the birth of CDEL, \"which was one of the biggest successes in the history of LaSalle\".From 2001 to 2013, he was a Council member of the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal, which greatly benefited from his real estate experience and expertise, entrusting him with the position of vice-chairman of the Commission permanente du logement social (standing committee on social housing). At the present time, he is a member of Ville de Montréal's Commission sur le développement économique et urbain et l'habitation (committee on economic and urban development and housing).A certified real estate agent for 40 years, a businessman actively involved in his community, Alvaro Farinacci has also played a major role in LaSalle's community and cultural life, for instance, as a member of the Board of Directors of Centre culturel Henri-Lemieux and the Fondation de l'Hôpital LaSalle, where he was a Board member and vice-chairman for 25 years.",
