Following his retirement from Royal Insurance, he became a private insurance consultant for a number of years. In the 1999 election, he was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the provincial riding of Saint John Lancaster as a Progressive Conservative and shortly afterwards became the New Brunswick Minister of Labour. In 2000, he became minister for the new Department of Training and Employment Development, a portfolio which encompassed much of his old labour portfolio as well as some social welfare programs and community colleges. McFarlane was defeated in the 2003 election and left the cabinet as a result. McFarlane lost his seat to Liberal Abel LeBlanc. McFarlane promptly returned to politics in 2004 when he was elected mayor of Saint John by defeating incumbent Shirley McAlary by a margin of over 25%. Ironically, one of McAlary's key backers was Abel LeBlanc. Mayor McFarlane faced severe and lasting criticism and allegations of corruption and incompetence for his role in granting Irving Oil tax concessions in 2005, concessions that have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.",

She resigned her seat on council upon being elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1991 provincial election. A member of Frank McKenna's Liberal Party, she was immediately named to cabinet and became deputy premier in 1994. She served in a variety of roles in cabinet until the defeat of the Liberals in the 1999 election. She defeated PC candidate Robert N. Stairs to retain her seat in Bathurst, one of only 10 Liberals to survive what was their worst ever electoral defeat. In opposition she was a top critic and the media reported she had lost the vote in her caucus to become interim leader of her party by a margin of 4-3 following the resignation of Camille Thériault. Her most high-profile role in opposition was that of finance critic. She did not seek re-election to the legislature in 2003 but has remained active in her party. She was elected vice president of the New Brunswick Liberal Association on October 4, 2003 and re-elected on October 15, 2005. During the 2004 federal election, she was co-chair of the Liberal campaign in New Brunswick. She was the Liberal candidate for the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Acadie—Bathurst in the 2006 federal election, but finished second to Yvon Godin of the New Democratic Party. She served as co-chair of the successful Liberal campaign as it prepared for the 2006 provincial election. She succeeded Greg Byrne as president of the New Brunswick Liberal Party when he resigned after being appointed to the cabinet following the 2006 election and served the post until stepping down in the Fall of 2007.",

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1995, and again from 2001 to 2012 who represented ridings north of Toronto in the city of Vaughan. Sorbara served as a cabinet minister in the governments of David Peterson and Dalton McGuinty. He resigned from cabinet October 11, 2005, following a police investigation involving his family's real estate development firm and was reinstated on May 23, 2006 after a judge ruled that there was no cause for including Sorbara's name on a search warrant. Sorbara chaired the party's successful 2007 election campaign but announced on October 26, 2007 that he was leaving the cabinet to spend more time with his family but would continue as a backbench MPP. On August 1, 2012, Sorbara announced that he was retiring from the legislature but would stay on as chair of the Liberal's election campaign.",
