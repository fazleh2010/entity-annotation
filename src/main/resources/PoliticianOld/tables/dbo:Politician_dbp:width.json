  "text" : "John Jeremy Thorpe, PC (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the Liberal Party between 1967 and 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, based on his earlier relationship with Norman Scott, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and the furore surrounding it, ended his political career. Thorpe was the son and grandson of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with neither of the main parties attaining a majority (\"Hung parliament\"), Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government. The February 1974 election proved to be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence on the grounds that the prosecution had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.",

  "text" : "John Hutchyns Tyndall' (14 July 1934 – 19 July 2005) was a British National Socialist. As a prominent figure in British nationalism during the second half of the twentieth century, Tyndall was involved during the 1960s with neo-Nazi movements, most notably being the deputy leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement under Colin Jordan. However, he is best known for leading the National Front (NF) in the late 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Born in Devon, Tyndall undertook national service prior to reading the work of Adolf Hitler and involving himself in extreme-right politics. In the mid-1950s he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Growing frustrated with the LEL's approach, in 1957 he co-founded the National Labour Party (NLP) with John Bean. In 1960 the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Tyndall grew close to Jordan and together they embraced an overt Neo-Nazi approach to racial nationalism, establishing a paramilitary group called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement. In 1962 he was convicted and imprisoned for establishing a paramilitary organisation. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall then formed his Greater Britain Movement, another explicitly Neo-Nazi group, in 1964. In 1967 Tyndall joined the newly established National Front, which was then led by Chesterton. He took on the role of Vice Chairman and eventually assumed the position of Chairman in 1972. His leadership was however threatened by both a 'populist moderate' faction and a Strasserite faction. In 1974 he was deposed as Chairman and briefly expelled from the party the following year. On his return he resumed his position as Chairman, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980, forming his short-lived New National Front. In 1982 he established the new British National Party, which grew into the most prominent extreme-right group in the UK by the late 1980s. Electoral success however largely eluded the party. Tyndall's refusal to moderate any of the party's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of 'modernisers', who succeeded in ousting him in 1999, when he was replaced by Nick Griffin. Tyndall retained his affiliation with the BNP for the following few years prior to his death.",

  "text" : "Jonathan Jennings (March 27, 1784 – July 26, 1834) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine-term congressman from Indiana. Born in either Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806. Jennings initially intended to practice law, but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself, and pursued interests in land speculation and politics. Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career. In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown, in Clark County. He was elected as the Indiana Territory's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate. By 1812 he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government. Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812. As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816, which authorized the organization of Indiana's state government and state constitution. He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention, held in Corydon in June 1816, where he helped draft the state's first constitution. Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government. In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements. Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life. His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years. Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings's life and impact on the development of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings's importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen's assessment that the state \"owes him more than she can compute.\"",

  "text" : "James Thomas \"Jim\" Walsh (born June 19, 1947) is an American Republican politician from Syracuse, New York. Currently a government affairs counselor for K & L Gates in Washington, DC, Walsh retired from the United States House of Representatives in 2009 after serving for twenty years. Walsh represented a portion of Central New York, that is now known as the state's 24th Congressional District. While in Congress, Walsh was a member of the United States House Committee on Appropriations for 16 years, also chairing several of its subcommittees. As chair of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, alone, Walsh had spending oversight of more than $100 billion during the 109th Congress. In his capacities as chair and member of committees, subcommittees, and caucuses in Congress, Walsh secured hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds for veterans affairs, healthcare, technology, the environment, higher educational institutions, and many other areas. Walsh was further active in the peace process in Northern Ireland, for which the Walsh Visa was created and named in his honor. As co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Hearing Health Caucus, Walsh secured passage of laws aimed at guaranteeing universal hearing screenings for newborns and infants in the United States. In 2009, an act that he proposed and which was enacted that achieved this effort was renamed for him in his honor, becoming known as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Walsh's change of perspective regarding both of then-President George W. Bush's troop surge of 2007 and ideology regarding the Iraq War, caused Walsh's views to gain headlines in the news media, as well as for additionally desiring a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. For one decade during the 1970s and 1980s, Walsh was active on the Syracuse City Council, serving as its leader for five years. In 1999, he issued a challenge with several goals that is known as The Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative (SNI) for revitalization of the city. The many phases of SNI have been successful in improving neighborhoods and housing in numerous areas of the city. Generally known as a moderate, pro-labor Republican, Walsh currently lives in Washington, DC with his wife, Dede. Walsh's father, William F. Walsh, served as Mayor of Syracuse during the 1960s, as well as a Republican Congress Member of the House of Representatives in the 1970s.",

  "text" : "Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin. Willkie was born in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was initially employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C&S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&S, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&S's property for a good price, and gained public esteem. A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters – many youthful – enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces under Hitler rampaged through western Europe in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states. After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.",

  "text" : "William Wilberforce (24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833) was an English politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to eradicate the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he became an Evangelical Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform. In 1787, he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad. In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.",

Stork was defeated when he ran for reelection in the Swift Current provincial riding in 1938. In October 1938, he refused to stand for nomination in the federal Maple Creek riding after his name was put forward. By the following year, he had become an organizer for the Liberal party. Stork moved to Regina, where he was involved in the oil business, and later moved to Calgary. After the death of his second wife in 1958, he moved to London, Ontario, still employed in the oil industry. Stork became seriously ill in 1968 and died two years later.",

  "text" : "Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ruhollah Mūsavi Khomeini (Persian: روح‌الله خمینی‎‎, [ruːholˈlɑːhe χomeiˈniː] , 24 September 1902 – 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader, revolutionary and politician. He was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei. Khomeini was a marja (\"source of emulation\") in Twelver Shia Islam, a Mujtahid or faqih (an expert in Islamic law) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the theory of velayat-e faqih, the \"Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority)\", to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists. This principle (though not known to the wider public before the revolution), was appended to the new Iranian constitution after being put to a referendum. Khomeini called democracy the equivalent of prostitution. He was named Man of the Year in 1979 by American news magazine TIME for his international influence, and has been described as the \"virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\" where he remains a controversial figure. In 1982, Khomeini survived one military coup attempt. Khomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis, his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, and for referring to the United States as the \"Great Satan\". Khomeini has been criticized for these acts and for human rights violations of Iranians (including his ordering of execution of thousands of political prisoners), and the pursuit of victory in the Iran–Iraq War that ultimately proved futile. He has also been lauded as a \"charismatic leader of immense popularity\", a \"champion of Islamic revival\" by Shia scholars, who attempted to establish good relations between Sunnis and Shias, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini held the title of Grand Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. He is generally referred to as Ayatollah Khomeini by others. In Iran, his gold-domed tomb in Tehrān's Behesht-e Zahrāʾ cemetery has become a shrine for his supporters, and he is legally considered \"inviolable\", with Iranians regularly punished for insulting him.",

He complained of the \"Blatant promotion of opposing points of view\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston after seeing that Derek Warfield had a radio channel dedicated to his music. Beggs, it was the same as \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights stating: \"It is something that should not have been on board and we removed it immediately we became aware of it.\"",

A resident of Cheektowaga, New York, Gorski is a former County Executive of Erie County, New York, which includes Buffalo, New York and many of its suburbs. He was the first Democrat elected Erie County Executive and the first Erie County Executive elected to three four-year terms. Gorski was an Erie County Legislator and a member of the New York State Assembly prior to three-term service as county executive. During his second term as County Executive, he ran for Congress to succeed Democrat Henry Nowak, but he was defeated in the general election by Republican Jack Quinn. Like many Buffalo Democrats, including Buffalo Mayors Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, Gorski was known for being more conservative than the mainstream Democratic Party platform, and was regularly cross-endorsed by the Conservative Party of New York. As county executive, he rivaled his contemporary Buffalo Mayors and on some issues his contemporary New York State Governors in power: He succeeded in bringing the World University Games to Buffalo, and since the National Football League Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, New York it was his responsibility to broker a deal to keep the team from leaving town. He also helped the National Hockey League Buffalo Sabres finance Marine Midland Arena (now known as First Niagara Center). During his early years he brought about economic recovery and kept the county on solid financial footing during his tenure. He has been described as the only County Executive to balance the budget. Gorski is a Vietnam War veteran and remained active in Veteran's affairs while in office. Since leaving the county executive's office, he has worked in private business in Buffalo, New York. Gorski spent his first nine years of public life working for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) and was subsequently was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo.",

Gespräche mit US-Politikern und mit Rüstungsherstellern, laut dem Tagesspiegel schrieb er hierzu auf seiner Facebook-Seite: Bei der Parlamentswahl in der Ukraine 2014 kandidierte Sementschenko auf dem zweiten Platz der Liste der Partei Samopomitsch und wurde in die Werchowna Rada gewählt. 2015/2016 kandidierte Sementschenko als Bürgermeister der zentralukrainischen Stadt Krywyj Rih, verlor aber mit lediglich 11 % der Stimmen gegen Jurij Wilkul vom Oppositionsblock (73 %).",

  "text" : "George Lansbury, PC (22 February 1859 – 7 May 1940) was a British politician and social reformer who led the Labour Party from 1932 to 1935. Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929–31, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of social justice, women's rights and world disarmament. Originally a radical Liberal, Lansbury converted to socialism in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to parliament in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women's suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action. In 1912 Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution. These positions contributed to Lansbury's failure to be elected to parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar, and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in the Poplar \"rates revolt\" of 1921. After his return to parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931 Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but stayed with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the party's leader. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 party conference he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.",

He also held a seat on the 25-member Politburo of the Communist Party of China between 2007 and 2012. Born to a working-class family in Liaoning province, Xu spent much of his earlier career in northeastern China. He moved to Beijing in 1990 to become political commissar of the 16th Group Army, later serving as editor of the PLA's flagship newspaper, the PLA Daily. In 1996 Xu became political commissar of the Jinan Military Region. He became Vice-Chairman of the CMC in September 2004. He retired from office in March 2013. Xu was detained and put under investigation on suspicion of bribery in March 2014, in one of the highest profile corruption investigations in PLA history, and was expelled from the Communist Party in June 2014. It was alleged that Xu had traded \"massive bribes\" for the promotion of officers under him during his time as Vice-Chairman of the CMC. Xu was undergoing legal proceedings and facing a court martial but charges were dropped after he died of bladder cancer in March 2015.",

Anthonie Duyck studierte die Rechte an der Universiteit Leiden, und avancierte im Jahre 1589 zum Ankläger in der Körperschaft des Staatsrates der Niederlande, Raad van State genannt. Als Leiter des Staatsrates unterstützte er Moritz von Oranien-Nassau bei dessen militärischen Unternehmungen in den Jahren von 1591 bis 1602. Duyck verfasste darüber sehr lange Berichte, und im Jahre 1602 wurde Duyck zum Archivar am Hof van Holland bestellt. Gegen seinen Willen musste Duyck an der Seite von François van Aerssen als einer der Ankläger gegen Johan van Oldenbarnevelt auftreten. Nach einem kurzen Intermezzo von Andries de Witt wurde Duyck im Jahre 1621 zum Ratspensionär von Holland und Westfriesland ernannt. Da Duycks mehr ein Beamter als ein Staatsmann war, hatte Moritz von Oranien-Nassau mit ihm leichtes Spiel in der Umsetzung seiner politischen Überzeugungen. Duyck hatte dieses Amt bis zu seinem im Jahre 1629 erfolgten Tod inne. Anthonie Duycks Tagebücher über die Moritz von Oraniens begangenen Feldzüge wurden unter dem Namen Journaal van Maurits' krijgsverrichtingen van 1591–1602 verlegt.",

  "text" : "(For other people named Arthur Eve, see Arthur Eve (disambiguation).) Arthur O. Eve (born March 23, 1933) is a retired American politician who served as a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly (1967–2002) and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly (1979–2002) representing districts in Buffalo, New York. He was the first Dominican-American elected to public office in the United States, and the first African American to win the Buffalo Mayoral Democratic Primary but was defeated in the following mayoral election. Eve was elected a New York State Assemblyman in 1966 and by the time of his retirement in 2002 had served in the New York State Assembly (143rd District 1967–82, 141st District 1983–2002) longer than any other incumbent member. As Deputy Speaker, he was the highest ranking African American in the New York State Legislature. During his political career he became a political foe of Western New York politician James D. Griffin and of New York State Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. He was a founding member of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. At the national level, Eve was once one of three alternates to the 15-person 1984 Democratic Party Platform Committee. Eve was an observer and negotiator during the 1971 Attica Prison riot and the first official to enter the facility to hear the demands of the inmates. An advocate for liberal causes such as economic development, education, job training and development, social services, crime prevention and parole reform, day care and housing, Eve was also a leader in the movement to legislate Harriet Tubman Day as a New York State holiday. He is the father of attorney and former candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York Leecia Eve.",
