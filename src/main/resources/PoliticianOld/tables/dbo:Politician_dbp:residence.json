During his time in office, he instituted street paving for Bayonne. He lost a chance for a third term when he was defeated by Republican Councilman William C. Farr, who also was endorsed by the Democrats and the Independent Parties in a highly contested election. A year after the election, Newman switched to the Democratic Party.

  "text" : "Edson Jonasi Zvobgo (2 October 1935 – 22 August 2004) was a founder of Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF, was the Patriotic Front's spokesman at the Lancaster House in late 1979, a Harvard-trained lawyer, and a poet. His name is often misspelled by the media, either as Eddison instead of Edson or Zvogbo instead of Zvobgo. He was born in then Southern Rhodesia in 1935, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1960, Zvobgo won a scholarship to Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts aged 25. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be arrested and detained for political activism against white rule in Rhodesia, along with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. Zvobgo was freed in 1971, and he spent a period in exile in Canada. He then studied law at Harvard and international relations at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, followed by a position as associate professor teaching criminal law at Lewis University College in Illinois. Zvobgo played a key role in international negotiations at Lancaster House that ended the bitter bush war and led to British-sponsored all race elections ahead of independence in 1980. He was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the Constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one-party state. Initially a staunch supporter of Zanu-PF policies, in later years he criticised Robert Mugabe's autocratic rule. In 1992 Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of Minister of Mines. In 1996 he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken. This accident was considered suspicious by many. Shortly after the accident Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to Minister Without Portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". Despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily News, and to arrest at least 31 independent journalists. He became the subject of an internal party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and after describing the laws as a weapon to stifle opposition to the government, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. Zvobgo had also been accused of holding private talks with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as the ruling party abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. Zvobgo died on 22 August 2004 after a lengthy battle with cancer. His wife Julia Tukai Zvobgo, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February 2004 at the age of 67. He is survived by his seven children, Kerina, Edson Junior, Tsungirirai, Jonasi, Esther, Tendai and Farai Emily.",

  "text" : "Hoos was born in Neuwied am Rhine, Germany on August 31, 1850. He was an upholster and after immigrating to the United States, started a furniture business in Jersey City. His wife Dora Wilkins, of Hanover, Germany, died in 1890. In 1897, he was pushed by Democratic political boss, Robert Davis, to run for Mayor of Jersey City. The mayoral election of 1897 was very controversial. The Republican controlled state legislature passed the McArthur Act which postponed Jersey City and Newark's elections from the Spring to November to make them coincide with the state elections. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that this was unconstitutional. The Republicans appealed the Supreme Court's decision to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals. Since the decision was under appeal, the Republicans claimed that the elections planned for April 14 should not be held at that time until the court ruled on their appeal and if they were held then their results would not be valid until after the appeal was ruled on. The Democrats claimed they would be held and their results would be valid. Hoos won the election against Republican J. Herbert Potts, 15,264 votes to 12,018. however, Mayor Peter F. Wanser refused to vacate the mayor's office claiming the election was not valid until their appeal was heard in court. Hoos had to formally demand Wanser to leave the office on May 3, 1897. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled in September in favor of Hoos. Hoos won re-election over Republican Edward M. Watson by an even bigger margin of 7,000 votes on April 11, 1899. Hoos had served two terms (May 3, 1897 to December 31, 1901), but Boss Davis knew the voters wanted a change and dumped Hoos from the ticket in 1901 in favor of Edward L. Young (New Jersey), son of Edward Faitoute Condict Young (Davis' financial backing). It did not matter to the voters who swept in Republican Mark M. Fagan as mayor. Hoos died on October 24, 1912 and was buried in New York Bay Cemetery in Jersey City alongside his wife and three of his children.",

He then established a stage coach line from Greenville (modern day Jersey City) to the ferry at Bergen Point. Brady, who was a Democrat, was appointed in 1885 by President Grover Cleveland to be the Postmaster of Bayonne. In 1903, Brady was elected mayor of Bayonne defeating Republican Pierre P. Garven and served for two years. In 1906, he returned to the company he helped found and worked there until his death at age 78. After a two-year illness, Brady died on March 13, 1928 in his home.

Servas was born Ploutarhos Loizou Savvidis (Πλούταρχος Λοΐζου Σαββίδης) and changed his surname to Servas while still a student in secondary education. Servas was born in Limassol, Cyprus in 1907. He studied social sciences in Moscow. He returned to Cyprus in the 1930s and had to sign a declaration saying he would not be involved in politics in order to be allowed to set foot in the country. He became the general secretary of the illegal Communist party of Cyprus and founder and first general secretary of AKEL (1941–1945). He was also the first elected Mayor of Limassol 1943–1946 and 1946–1949. As a mayor he participated in the consultative assembly and advocated accepting the British plan of self-government for Cyprus in 1948. For that opinion he became isolated within his party and was expelled in 1952. He supported Ioannis Clerides in the 1960 elections, but wasn't an active politician again himself. He worked mainly as a reporter and a writer. He wrote books such as: Spain on Fire (1936), The Labour Issue (1936), AKEL and Local Issues (1942), Portraits of Palmer's Era (1946), Corea (1949), Prague Spring (1973), How Did We Manage to Get to Zero; The Cypriot Tragedy (1975), Old and New China (1977), Responsibilities (first volume 1980, second volume 1984, third volume 1985). His death on 14 February 2001 caused controversy in Cyprus as in his will he had asked to be cremated. There were no crematoria in Cyprus and there was a heated debate between those supporting the availability of cremation as an alternative and those (mainly religious Orthodox Christians) who disapproved of it.",
