Thompson has been a lifelong Buffalonian and held political and politically related professional positions in Buffalo before his service in elective politics. Thompson was appointed to the city council in 2001 and was twice re-elected. He was discouraged from pursuing his interest in election to the United States House of Representatives in 2005. He was encouraged to pursue a New York Senate Seat, but was not nominated by the Democratic Party when the seat first became available in a special election. However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican.",
