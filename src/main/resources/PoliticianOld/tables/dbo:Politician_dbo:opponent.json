In 2007, Destiny New Zealand was disbanded, with Lewis instead becoming leader of the newly formed The Family Party.

In March 2007, Benson filed in Alaska to make her second bid for the U.S. House of Representatives, but was defeated in the August 2008 Democratic primary by Ethan Berkowitz--the same person with whom she ran on the 2010 governor-lieutenant governor ticket--who was that year a \"Red to Blue\" candidate supported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

While the 18th district leans only slightly Democratic, having a Cook PVI D+4, Cardoza only faced serious competition in 2002, when he was first elected to the seat. This race is considered competitive in 2010 because of Mike's experience in local agriculture, his family name, and the current political climate. Berryhill comes from a Republican political family that's well known in the San Joaquin Valley. Mike’s Uncle, Clare Berryhill, served in both houses of the California State Legislature and also served as director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture under Governor George Deukmejian. His first cousins, Tom and Bill Berryhill, currently represent the 25th and 26th districts, respectively, in the California State Assembly. Mike was president of Young Farmers and Ranchers of California and elected to the Turlock Irrigation District Board. He also served several decades on the Ceres School Board, and, in 2005, Berryhill Elementary School was named in honor of Mike and other members of the Berryhill family who served on the school board.",

He was the nominee for the Republican and Conservative parties ultimately losing to incumbent Borough President Helen Marshall. Sica's earliest education was at St. Stephen's Elementary School. Sica graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School. He then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts from Pace University (Government and Business), a B.A. from Atlantic Union College (Religion), attended New York Law School, and did religious graduate work with Andrews University. Sica served New York City in various capacities. He worked in the New York City Department of Hospitals, which is now called the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. He was a senior investigator for the New York City Department of Finance, a NYC Housing Authority Assistant, a detective-investigator for the Queens County District Attorney's Office, and Marshal for the City (mayoral appointment). In 1980, Sica's career changed when he became a minister of various Seventh-day Adventist Churches in the city. Prior to running for borough president, Sica ran for the State Assembly's 24th district in 2000, and lost to Mark Weprin (72% to 28%). Sica then went on to run for Council District 23 in 2001 and lost to David Weprin (Mark's brother) 69% to 31%. During his run for the Council District, Sica outlined his wishes to promote a reduction in crime, the lowering of taxes, and reform of the city's education system through increased investment by the state. In the race for the State Assembly, Sica received the support of the Republican Party, the Conservative Party, and the Right to Life. In his 2001 bid for the City Council, he was additionally endorsed by the Independence Party. Sica was unopposed for the Republican and Conservative parties' nomination in the race for Queens Borough President. Additionally, Borough President Helen Marshall ran unopposed for the nomination of the Democratic and Working Families parties. After counting the absentee ballots and affidavit ballots cast either for Marshall or Sica, the result turned out to be seventy-five percent for Marshall and twenty-five percent for Sica. Sica's strongest assembly district was A.D. 23 (comprising Howard Beach, Ozone Park, and Far Rockaway) where he garnered 39% of the votes cast. Sica is married to Naomi (Jungling) Sica, Ed.D. Sica has four adult children and four grandchildren. Sica is active in the American Legion, having served in the Army's Military Police. On September 18, 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to continue representing the Republicans of the 24th Assembly District in the New York Republican State Committee. In October 2007, Philip T. Sica was elected to be a Vice-Chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and is again serving as its Chaplain.",
