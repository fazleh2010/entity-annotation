John Primatt Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud GCB CBE (3 February 1906 – 20 November 1982) was a British civil servant and diplomat. Born in Bristol, Maud was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford. He gained a Second in Classical Moderations in 1928 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats') in 1928.At Oxford he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS). In 1928, he gained the one-year Henry P. Davison scholarship to Harvard University where he was awarded an A.B. in 1929. From 1929 to 1932 he was a Junior Research Fellow University College, Oxford and from 1932-39 Fellow (Praelector in Politics) and Dean of the college. He was awarded a Rhodes Travelling Scholarship to Africa in 1932 and held a University Lectureship in Politics at Oxford University, 1938-9. During World War II, he was Master of Birkbeck College and was also based at Reading Gaol, working for the Ministry of Food. He became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1942, and after the war, he worked at the Ministry of Education (1945–1952), rising to Permanent Secretary and then the Ministry of Fuel and Power until 1958. He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1946, and was raised to a Knight Grand Cross in 1955. Inter alia, Maud appeared on the BBC programme The Brains Trust in 1958. He was High Commissioner to the Union of South Africa from 1959 to 1961, and Ambassador from 1961, when the country became a republic and left the Commonwealth. In 1963, he became Master of University College, Oxford, where he had been a Fellow before the Second World War. In March 1964, Maud was appointed by Sir Keith Joseph, at the request of local council associations, to head a departmental committee looking into the management of local government. The Maud Committee reported three years later. During the course of the inquiry, Maud was chosen to head a Royal Commission on the reform of all local government in England. He was awarded a life peerage, hyphenating his surname to become Baron Redcliffe-Maud, of the City and County of Bristol in 1967. The Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England, popularly known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, was published in 1969. It advocated the wholesale reform of local council boundaries and the institution of large unitary councils based on the principle of mixing rural and urban areas. Accepted by the Labour government of Harold Wilson with minor changes, the opposition from rural areas convinced the Conservative opposition to oppose it and no further action was taken after the Conservatives won the 1970 general election. He retired as Master of University College in 1976, to be succeeded by the leading lawyer Lord Goodman. His 1973 portrait by Ruskin Spear can be seen in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Another portrait hangs in the Hall at University College in Oxford. Redcliffe-Maud was married to Jean Hamilton, who was educated at Somerville College, Oxford. His son, Humphrey Maud, was one of Benjamin Britten's favourite boys while he was at Eton. Sir John intervened to curtail Humphrey's frequent visits to stay with Britten on his own. The incident is described in John Bridcut's Britten's Children. John Redcliffe-Maud is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. His archive is held by the London School of Economics Library. Redcliffe-Maud House at the University College Annex known as \"Stavertonia\" in North Oxford is named in honour of him.",

By 1765 he had entered business on his own as a shipper and importer. He became prosperous and in 1772 he married his mentor's daughter, Hannah Tracy. Shortly after he went into a partnership with his wife's brothers, John and Nathaniel Tracy. The firm of Jackson, Tracy, & Tracy failed during the revolution. So, after 1782, Jonathan took a series of salaried jobs. In 1780 Jackson joined John Hancock and other community leaders in the founding of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.",

  "text" : "James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose KT CB CVO VD (1 May 1878 – 20 January 1954), was a Scottish nobleman, naval officer, politician and engineer. The eldest son of Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose, he was educated at Eton College. In 1906 he married Lady Mary Douglas-Hamilton, the only child of the 12th Duke of Hamilton. They had four children, Lord James Graham (later the 7th Duke), Lady Mary Graham, Lord Ronald Graham and Lady Jean Graham. As a mariner, he served in the Mercantile Marine and ASC in South Africa, during which time he obtained the first film ever taken of a total eclipse of the Sun during a Royal Astronomical Society expedition to India in 1899, and took part in a mission in 1900 for Lloyd's of London to the South African Government to establish wireless telegraphic stations on the coast. Having been instrumental in founding the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in 1903, he served in the Auxiliary Naval Service during World War I and was later Commodore of the RNVR Clyde Division, then the East Coast of Scotland RNVR, and fulfilled the role of Commodore of the entire RNVR from 1921 until he retired in 1927. As a result, from 1946 to 1968, whichever ship was attached to the Tay Division of the Royal Naval Reserve (in Dundee) was always temporarily renamed HMS Montrose after the 6th Duke. In 1992, the seventh Duke-class frigate HMS Montrose was so-named for the same reason. In his political life, he was unpaid Assistant Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1905, and Naval Aide-de-Camp to His Majesty. However, he was unsuccessful as the Scottish Unionist Party (effectively the Conservative Party in Scotland) parliamentary candidate for Stirlingshire in 1906, and as the Conservative Party candidate at the 1906 by-election at Eye, Suffolk, and at the subsequent general election in 1910; although holding the courtesy title of the Marquess of Graham from 1907 (when his father was the 5th Duke), he contested these elections as James Graham. He entered the House of Lords as the 6th Duke when he succeeded to the title in 1925. When the Home Rule movement decided to split from the avowedly anti-Home Rule Scottish Unionist Party in 1932, he became chairman of the new centre-right Scottish Party, and successfully steered it towards a merger with the centre-left National Party of Scotland in April 1934, therefore founding the modern Scottish National Party. He joined the Liberal Party in 1936. As an engineer, he was the inventor of the world's first naval aircraft carrier, when in 1912, as a director of William Beardmore and Company, of Dalmuir, he designed a 14,450 ton merchant vessel intended for delivery to the Lloyd Sabaudo Line of Italy as the SS Conte Rosso. When war broke out in 1914, work on the vessel ceased, but was resumed in 1916 as an aircraft carrier. The conversion work was completed in September 1918 and the vessel was commissioned as HMS Argus - recognised as the first ever \"flat top\". The Duke was also designer and owner of the first seagoing heavy oil motorship. He was President of the British Institution of Marine Engineers in 1911, and President of the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1916 and 1917. Afterwards, he was Vice-President of the Institution of Naval Architects, a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a Trustee for the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, a Member of the Royal Company of Archers, and Commodore of the Sea Cadets in Scotland. In 1935 he became the second President on the National Institute for the Deaf, a post he held until his death.",

  "text" : "Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin. Willkie was born in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was initially employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C&S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&S, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&S's property for a good price, and gained public esteem. A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters – many youthful – enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces under Hitler rampaged through western Europe in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states. After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.",

He married firstly to the former Olive Chancey (1838–1864) of Clinch County, Georgia, by whom he had two sons who died young. The Bracks removed to Alexandria, Louisiana before the outbreak of the American Civil War. During that conflict, the future mayor served in Company C of the 27th Louisiana Infantry Regiment. After the war, the widowed Brack came to Florida, where he married his second wife Amy (July 5, 1847 - May 25, 1880). They had three daughters before her untimely death: Olive, Bessie, and Josphine Brack. It is unclear exactly when Brack settled in the Orlando area. He was certainly there by October 16, 1873, when he was mentioned as guardian ad litem for the orphans of Mrs. Lucinda Hughey Terrell in a lawsuit filed in the circuit court of Orange County, Florida. In 1875, when Orlando was formally incorporated, Brack was elected its first mayor. He was subsequently re-elected to a second one-year term. After leaving office, the former mayor remained in the Orlando area as a farmer and fruit grower until at least 1880. He was married there to his third wife Eliza Alpha Tyson on March 6, 1881. They had eight children: John Percy (\"Jack\"), Rosa Banner, Gussie, Emma Hortense, Ruby B, Blanche Alice, and Lillian Bell Brack, William Jackson, Jr The Bracks left Orlando to live on the north shore of Lake Tohopekaliga in what is now Osceola County, Florida, where they operated a general store and sawmill at \"Brack's Landing.\" From that point, he also captained a 35-foot sidewheel steamboat called \"Spray\" along the inland canals that connected the Kissimmee River valley to Fort Myers, Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. The former mayor retired to a cattle ranch near Narcoossee, Florida, where he died April 30, 1901. He is buried at Mount Peace Cemetery in Saint Cloud, Florida.",

He was born in Joliet, Illinois on September 22, 1867, the son of William F. Stewart (b. Ohio) and Julia Ann Hutchins (b. Maysville, Kentucky). He married Annie Mabel Nash in Titusville on May 24, 1888. She was the daughter of Clarence and Annie Hyatt Nash, a wealthy family from Norwalk, Connecticut with a home in Daytona. He and his wife Annie Mabel Nash Stewart came to Melbourne in 1888. They were well educated and cultured, but wanted to be pioneers. He was elected mayor in 1890 when he was only 23. He opened a hardware store and mortuary on New Haven Ave named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Frank Fee, who would also serve as mayor. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. In 1908, he was a presidential elector for the Republican Party. Documentation exists from as early as 1898 in the form of letters and invoices, books and newspaper articles reflecting his business was already located at 1002 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL. In 1919, Stewart's Front Street store burned down, along with most of the downtown businesses in \"The Great Fire.\" After this time, the downtown was no longer in that area, but moved to the west side of U.S. 1. Stewart moved his business to New Haven Avenue. He may have moved his business to 1002 E New Haven Ave before the fire of 1919. In 1920, he was a co-founder of the Melbourne Golf and Country Club. He died in Melbourne, Florida, on June 18, 1936. He was buried in Daytona Beach, Florida.",

Robbins was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, son of Capt. B. Robbins, and educated at the Yarmouth Academy. He arrived in Wellington in 1874, and was a storekeeper in Hawera from 1881. In Hawera he organised a local dairy factory and the National Dairy Association. He was on various local boards; Fire Board (3 years), Hospital Board (chairman 1906-09), and the Wanganui Education Board 1897-1906. His first public service was as a member of the school committee in Hawera for a good decade, where he was chairman for most of that time. He was a member of the Hawera Borough Council for fifteen years and Mayor of Hawera for seven years. Robbins stood in the 1893 election in the Egmont electorate and came second of three candidates. He contested the Hawera electorate in the 1896 and 1905 elections. He came a close second in 1896, and came third in 1905. Robbins moved to Tauranga in 1911, and was Mayor of Tauranga twice, from 1912 to 1915 and 1929 to 1933. He retired from the mayoralty in 1915 and did not contest the election, which was won by Charles MacMillan over John Cuthbert Adams. Robbins stood against the incumbent, William Herries of the Reform Party, in the 1919 election in the Tauranga electorate and was beaten with a margin of over 30% of the vote. He initially declared himself an Independent Progressive Liberal but received the endorsement of Joseph Ward and was the official candidate of the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Legislative Council by the First Labour Government. He died in January 1953 aged 96 and is buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery on 18th Avenue in Tauranga. He married in 1877 Jane Anne Ross (died 6 March 1950).",

He saw the aggressive Germanization of Polish territories controlled by the German Empire as the major threat to Polish culture and therefore advocated a degree of accommodation with another power that had partitioned Poland, the Russian Empire. He favored the re-establishment of Polish independence by nonviolent means, and supported policies favorable to the Polish middle class. During World War I, in Paris, through his Polish National Committee he was a prominent spokesman, to the Allies, for Polish aspirations. He was a principal figure instrumental in the postwar restoration of Poland's independent existence. Dmowski never wielded official political power, except for a brief period in 1923 as minister of foreign affairs. Nevertheless, he was one of the most influential Polish ideologues and politicians of his time. A controversial personality all his life and since, Dmowski believed that only a Polish-speaking andRoman Catholic could be a good Pole; his thinking marginalized other minorities, and he was vocally anti-semitic. In 1926 he attempted to emulate Italian fascism. He remains the prototype of Polish right-wing nationalism and has been called \"the father of Polish nationalism.\" Throughout most of his life, he was the chief opponent of the Polish military and political leader Józef Piłsudski and of the latter's vision of Poland as a multinational federation.",

  "text" : "Sir Richard Nagle (1636 – 6 April 1699) was an Irish politician and lawyer. He held the positions of Attorney-General for Ireland, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Lord Justice of Ireland and Secretary of State and War for Ireland under King James II. He fled to France in 1691, joining James II at Saint Germain, where he resumed his duties as nominal Secretary of State and War. He later served as Commissioner of the Household. Richard was born into an Old English family at Carrigacunna Castle, in County Cork, the son of James Nagle of Annakissy, and James' wife, Honora Nugent. This was his family's seat. His brother Pierce was a future High Sheriff of Cork. Although Richard was initially destined to join the clergy, he was educated in law at Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in Dublin. \"Active and skillful\", he had a successful career as a lawyer. The Earl of Tyrconnell brought Richard to England with him in 1685 to meet James II. James created him Attorney-General for Ireland and knighted him in 1686. He also appointed him to the Privy Council of Ireland. As an MP for Cork, Nagle was elected Speaker by the Irish House of Commons in 1689. This parliament is known to posterity as the \"Patriot Parliament\". It spurned the outcome of the Glorious Revolution, recognising King James's divine right to the Irish crown over William of Orange's parliamentary one. William, made King of England during the revolution, was set on conquering Ireland from James, and to achieve that end he launched the Williamite War. Richard was diametrically opposed to the Act of Settlement 1662 (he was the author of A Letter from Coventry, an anti-settlement pamphlet), which had punished royalists and Catholics who had fought against parliament in the Civil Wars; he unsuccessfully advocated its repeal in this session. James's forces were routed by William's at the Battle of the Boyne, in 1690; King James retreated to Dublin. It was here he convened a council that advised him to flee to France. Nagle was one of its members. They reasoned that if he did not leave \"he would run a great risk of being taken by the enemy\". James followed their advice. Nagle, accompanied by Tyrconnell, visited him at his court-in-exile, Saint Germain, at the end of 1690. In Nagle's absence, his duties as Secretary of State were executed by the Baron Nugent of Riverston. Upon the death of Tyrconnell, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Nagle became one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. The others were Francis Plowden and Baron Fitton of Gawsworth. They administered what remained of Jacobite Ireland in the place of the Lord Lieutenant, though they did not assume command of the armed forces. Sir Richard Nagle married Jane (Joan) O'Kearney on September 19, 1669 at Clonbrogan, Ireland. Jane's sister, Mary O'Kearney, married Sir Richard's brother, Pierce Nagle of Annakissy, the high sheriff of County Cork in 1689.",

He was the first of nine children of Theodore Titus, and Catharine Flick Howell. He was raised in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. He was enrolled for some time at the United States Military Academy at West Point, but did not graduate. In 1845, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia. Titus was a leader of the Narciso López filibuster expeditions that invaded Cuba in 1850-1851. He was a grocer and sawmill operator in Jacksonville, until migrating with his family to \"Bleeding Kansas\" in April 1856 to join pro-slavery forces. He resided at \"Fort Titus,\" a double-log cabin one mile south of Lecompton, that came under artillery attack from John Brown's raiders on Aug. 16, 1856. He was wounded, captured, and exchanged for Free-State prisoners, before joining filibuster William Walker in Nicaragua in Feb. 1857. After his force was defeated at Castillo Viejo a few weeks later, Titus went to New York. He and his brother Elliot moved to the Sonoita Valley, Arizona, where they operated various ore mines during 1858-1860. Titus returned to Jacksonville during the American Civil War and served as assistant quartermaster in the Florida Militia. He was also working for the Florida Provision Company, a business owned by his father-in-law, Edward S. Hopkins. The firm sold supplies to the Confederate Army. While transporting a load of Confederate draft dodgers to Nassau in 1863, Titus lost his steamer to the Northern blockade and was captured on the Indian River. He eluded imprisonment and later returned to Florida with his family, preceding a post-war wave of newcomers. He moved to New York with his family in 1865, but returned to Florida in November 1867, settling at Sand Point which at that time had a population of 250. Titus built a sawmill, general store and hotel at that location. Titus was appointed postmaster, and soon thereafter renamed the settlement \"Titusville.\" The name of Titusville was determined by a dominoes game with Captain Clark Rice on October 16, 1873. He lobbied tirelessly to have Titusville named as county seat. His efforts were realized on October 7, 1879 when a vote was taken and the result supported relocation of the county seat to Titusville. He was also the Justice of the Peace, a notary public for Volusia County, and a marine insurance underwriter's agent. Rheumatic gout kept him confined to a wheelchair during the last years of his life.",

He was born in Hamilton City, (which at the time was a part of Colusa County) the son of Edward Tillotson Reynolds and Frances Elizabeth Barnard Reynolds who were early settlers of Colusa County. Reynolds attended Woodman’s Academy in Chico, and Chico State Normal School, to which he enrolled at the age of seventeen, and continued for two and a half years. He then quit school to work in the fruit and nut business with his father, in 1898, when the firm of E. T. Reynolds and Son was established. Initially, they leased a warehouse, and eventually they bought a warehouse at the corner of First and Cedar Streets in Chico. In 1902, they built another warehouse, which had a railroad spur adjoining it at First and Cherry Streets. This warehouse still existed into the 21st-century, and was part of the Chico State campus under the same name as \"Reynolds Warehouse.\" By 1915, they were the largest handlers of almonds in the state. Their dried fruit business grew to the capacity of thirty-five hundred tons annually. Reynolds, with in partnership with others, owned the Cana Land Company, which comprised two hundred acres of fruit and nuts at Cana. Reynolds married Helen Adelia \"Nellie\" Davisson, in Suisun, in 1908. She was a Chico Normal School graduate, and school teacher until her marriage. In 1915, he was elected from the third ward as a trustee of the city. He served as chairman of the commission on fire, light and water. In 1919, he was elected president of the board of trustees. On June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a Board of Freeholders charged with framing a City Charter. On April 16, 1923, at-large elections were reinstated under the charter. Under the charter, the board of trustees was renamed the Chico City Council, and its chair was titled the Mayor. Reynolds was the last mayor to be titled \"president\" of the \"board of trustees\" before it became the modern Chico City Council.",

His father-in-law, Matthew Marvin, Sr. gave Smith half of his home lot and orchard. In 1672, he owned \"a parcel of land in Indian Field,\" not far from the Norwalk-Westport boundary. He was named a freeman in 1674. In 1679, he served as town treasurer. He was on a committee, along with Matthew Marvin, Sr., and John Bowton to obtain a minister for the settlement, which appointed Reverend Thomas Hanford. He served as a deputy of the Connecticut General Court in 1691. He was a townsman in 1698, 1702, 1706, and 1712. In 1702, he was selectman.

  "text" : "Michael \"Mickey\" Cafagna (July 26, 1943 - April 11, 2009) was the third elected mayor of the city of Poway, California, serving from 1998 until his death in 2009. Cafagna was born in Detroit, Michigan, the third son of Italian immigrants. He moved to Poway (then an unincorporated part of San Diego County) circa 1975; following a successful career as a real estate developer, he was appointed to the Poway City Council in 1992, eventually winning the mayoral election in November 1998. As Mayor, Cafagna represented Poway in the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), serving for a time as its chairman. His other contributions include the construction of Poway's city hall and of the South Poway Business Park on Scripps Poway Parkway, his efforts to fund much-needed improvements to freeways and transit systems, and his leadership during the Cedar and Witch Creek fires of 2003 and 2007, respectively. He was most known for his outgoing personality and his ability to make deals for the benefit of the city. His genial manner also aided him in public situations; Deputy Mayor Don Higginson recounted an incident at the 1998 World Series between the New York Yankees and the San Diego Padres where Cafagna - just before his election as Mayor - invited Higginson and about a hundred others to travel to New York for the first two games. During Game 1, the Poway contingent sat among the Yankee fans, who booed them and threw beer on them. While others got up and left, Cafagna remained and offered to buy the Yankee fans a beer. By the end of the game, they were applauding him; when the party returned for Game 2, the Yankee fans cheered him. Even his political opponents, such as Poway's first mayor Bob Emery, acknowledged that while they had been opposed to his philosophies at first (Cafagna was a real estate developer, while Emery advocated slow-growth policy), they began to see things from his point of view, just as he saw things from theirs, and they grew to respect his character and his genial attitude. Cafagna had in fact avoided doing his development business in Poway to avoid conflicts of interest, and as Mayor opposed helter-skelter sprawl throughout the region (often with the \"How much do we have to grow before we destroy the reasons we live here\" speech, as Emery termed it). In 2005, Cafagna was diagnosed with kidney cancer and underwent an operation to remove it. However, it returned nearly four years later, having spread to his lungs. His illness prevented him from conducting day-to-day city government, and as a result Deputy Mayor Higginson became acting mayor. Cafagna was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on March 5 from what was previously thought to be pneumonia, but later determined to be septic shock; he died there on April 11, at the age of 65. After services at St. Michael's Catholic Church, he was buried a week later at Dearborn Memorial Park in Poway. Cafagna was survived by his wife of 43 years, Sharon Green Cafagna, as well as their two children, Kevin and Stacy, and five grandchildren.",

He came to the New Haven Colony from England prior to 1637. He was a collector for Yale College in 1645. He served as an officer in the Cavalry Troop of Connecticut from 1650-66. In February 1652, Camfield sold his home lot in New Haven. That year, he moved to Norwalk, becoming one of the area's original settlers. He lived in Norwalk for fourteen years, becoming one of the settlement's and the colony's prominent citizens. He was a deputy of the Connecticut General Court from Norwalk in 1654. In 1662, he was a magistrate and judge for the court in Fairfield. He was one of the 19 signers of the Petition to King Charles II for the Charter of the Colony. In 1666, Matthew removed to Newark, Province of New Jersey along with Robert Treat, where he was one of the founders of that town. His home lot was located at about the present north-west corner of Washington and Market Streets. Apparent his departure from Norwalk is based upon some dissatisfaction with the union of the New Haven and Hartford colonies. Canfield Island in East Norwalk is named for him. He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery.",

His father, Dr. William Fee moved to Melbourne in 1884, and Frank Fee moved to Melbourne from Franklin, in 1887. He opened a hardware store and mortuary named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Charles H. Stewart, who had also served as mayor. Fee was in the hardware business in Pennsylvania. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce. He served as city alderman in Fort Pierce from 1904 to 1905, and as mayor from 1905 to 1907. Fee apparently had advanced views for his times. He opposed the death penalty and he supported compulsory education.",

In sein Vaterland zurückgekehrt, wurde er 1782 in der Garde des Erbstatthalters Wilhelm V. angestellt, studierte aber später in Leiden Rechtswissenschaften, stand 1787 während der Unruhen auf oranischer Seite und wurde nach Unterdrückung derselben Pensionär (Stadtschreiber) von Rotterdam, von welchem Posten er nach der Eroberung Hollands durch die Franzosen 1795 zurücktrat, um in Amsterdam ein Kaufmannsgeschäft zu übernehmen. Durch seinen fehlgeschlagenen Plan, eine Kolonie für die Anhänger des Hauses Oranien am Kap der Guten Hoffnung zu gründen, büßte er den größten Teil seines Vermögens ein; dagegen trug er 1813 wesentlich zur Befreiung Hollands vom französischen Okkupation bei, indem er, als die Verbündeten siegreich vordrangen, die Anhänger des Prinzen von Oranien in Den Haag vereinigte. Als Präsident der Kommission, welche mit der Entwerfung der neuen Verfassungsurkunde beauftragt war, übte er einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die übrigen Kommissionsmitglieder aus, so dass er der Haupturheber des niederländischen Staatsgrundgesetzes war. Darauf erhielt er das Departement der auswärtigen Angelegenheiten, wurde Vizepräsident des Staatsrats und 1815 Graf, nahm aber schon 1816 wegen Kränklichkeit seine Entlassung. Als Mitglied der Zweiten Kammer der Generalstaaten, in die er 1815 gewählt worden war, gehörte er zur Opposition gegen den Minister van Maanen. Auf seinen Platz in der Ersten Kammer verzichtete er, weil die Verhandlungen derselben nicht öffentlich waren. Er war vom 20. September 1815 bis 22.

Kerr's leadership was complicated by a split in the party in 1905 in which he and other senior Labor figures opted to form a coalition with the Liberal Party to achieve statewide reforms. Although initially he commanded the confidence of the party, a state conference of the party in 1907 rejected Kerr's leadership and the Liberal-Labor coalition, opting to go into the 1907 state election alone. Kerr continued in parliament as an independent Labor member but was challenged by official Labor candidates until his defeat in his seat in 1909. He died on 18 January 1930 in Brisbane and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.",

  "text" : "Aksel Larsen (August 5, 1897 – January 10, 1972) was a Danish politician who was chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark and chairman and founder of the Socialist People's Party. Larsen became leader of the Communist Party in 1932, and was elected to the Danish Parliament (Rigsdagen) in 1932. Together with other Danish communists, Larsen had to go into hiding in 1941 when the Danish police began arresting all party members. After the liberation of the Second World War Larsen became a minister in the interim government, and subsequently led his party to its best-ever result in the October 1945 election, in which it took 10% of the vote. The election however, resulted in a Liberal government, and Larsen's party was mostly shunned by the other party leaders. Following the rising in Hungary in 1956, Larsen condemned the Soviet Union's action. This led him into conflict with the members of the party leadership who had a greater loyalty to Moscow; a conflict that ended with his expulsion in November 1958. Larsen's reaction was to establish the Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti), which, thanks to Larsen's personal popularity, entered parliament at the 1960 election at the expense of the Communists, who from then on played only a very peripheral role in Danish politics. Aksel Larsen -- who was especially in later years highly respected among politicians, even if his party was seen as somewhat irresponsible -- remained as leader of the Socialists until 1968, when he handed over to Sigurd Ømann. He remained an MP until his death in 1972. In 2005, the Danish Institute for International Studies concluded that Larsen held a secret working relationship between 1958 and 1964 with one of Denmark's allied partners in the Cold War, stating that \"Larsen... obviously was an agent of a Western intelligence service.\"",
