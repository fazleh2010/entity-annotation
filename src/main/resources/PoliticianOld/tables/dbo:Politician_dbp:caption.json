Bartel was appointed Minister of Railways between 1919 and 1920, in 1922–1930 he was a member of Poland's Sejm. After Józef Piłsudski's May Coup d'état in 1926, he became prime minister and held this post during three broken tenures: 1926, 1928–29, 1929–1930. Bartel was the Deputy Prime Minister between 1926–1928 and Minister of Religious Beliefs and Public Enlightenment, when Piłsudski himself assumed the premiership, however, Bartel was in fact \"de facto\" prime minister during this period as Piłsudski did not concern himself with the day-to-day functions of the cabinet and the government. In 1930 upon giving up politics, he returned to the university as professor of mathematics. In 1930 he became rector of the Lwów Polytechnic and was soon awarded an honorary doctorate and membership in the Polish Mathematical Association. In 1937 he was appointed the Senator of Poland and held this post until World War II. After the Invasion of Poland by the Soviets and subsequent occupation, he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical Institute. In 1940 he was summoned to Moscow and offered a seat in the Soviet parliament. Following Operation Barbarossa, on 30 June 1941 the German Wehrmacht entered Lwów and began the persecution of the local intelligentsia. Bartel was imprisoned by the Gestapo two days later and offered to create a Polish puppet government with himself as the head. His eventual refusal of accepting the terms imposed by the occupant was considered as an act of treason against the German authorities. By the order of Heinrich Himmler Bartel was murdered on 26 July 1941, shortly after the Massacre of Lwów professors had ended.",

  "text" : "Kenneth Sweigard (September 21, 1919 – July 11, 2005) was a Pentecostal evangelist from Grande Prairie, Alberta, and politician who led the Social Credit Party of Canada from 1983 to 1986. In the 1980 election, Social Credit's five remaining Members of Parliament (all from Quebec) were defeated. The party had not had any MPs from its old base of Alberta and British Columbia since 1968. Sweigard first ran as a Social Credit candidate in the 1980 federal election. Standing in Peace River, Alberta, he came in fifth place with 462 votes. He placed behind the three major parties and the candidate for the Rhinoceros Party of Canada. Sweigard first sought the party’s leadership in 1982, when he lost to Martin Hattersley. Sweigard attended the party's leadership convention dressed as U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, wearing a top hat and carrying a walking stick. His entourage, dressed in 1860s style, held placards reading \"Free the Slaves\" and chanted \"Free the economic slaves\", a reference to the social credit theory of monetary reform and opposition to the charging of interest on borrowed money. Hattersley resigned as leader in June 1983 when the party would not expel three outspoken party members from Alberta, including Jim Keegstra who had been accused of anti-Semitism. Sweigard, who described Keegstra as a \"fine Christian gentleman\", was elected interim leader by means of a telephone conference call of 17 party members, with 9 votes to 5 votes for party vice-president Richard Lawrence and three for Adrien Lambert. As leader, he ran in the 1984 election in Timiskaming, placing last with 151 votes. Nationally, under his leadership, the party suffered what was, at the time, its worst performance to date receiving only 16,659 votes nationwide. Sweigard attempted to win the leadership on a permanent basis at the party's national convention in 1986 but fared poorly, despite telling delegates that he had been visited by an angel who had endorsed his candidacy. Sweigard received only 9 of 114 votes, finishing well behind winning candidate Harvey Lainson and runner-up Jim Keegstra. After losing the leadership, he ran again in the 1988 election in Peace River, where he came in last in a field of six candidates with 354 votes. He died at Grande Prairie in 2005.",

On May 1, 2014, Kelly took over the remainder of Ford's duties when Ford entered drug rehabilitation and started a leave of absence from Toronto City Council. These powers were returned when Ford returned to his job on July 1. Even though Kelly had all the powers of the mayoral office for 3 months, Ford still technically held the title of Mayor, while Kelly was still referred to as the Deputy Mayor.",

Aus der Mindanao Independence Movement ging dann die Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) hervor, die politische Reformen von der philippinischen Regierung verlangte. Jedoch gelang es der Organisation nicht, die Regierung für Reformen zu gewinnen. So trug die M.N.L.F. unter Misuaris Führung den Konflikt zwischen 1972 und 1976 gegen die Regierung Ferdinand Marcos und ihren Unterstützern mit Gewalt aus. Das Vorhaben scheiterte und Misuari ging nach Saudi-Arabien ins Exil. 1986 kehrte er nach dem Sturz Marcos in die Philippinen zurück. Von 1996 bis 2001 war wer Gouverneur der Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Im April 2008 wurde er als Chef der MNLF abgesetzt.",

Er war der Kandidat für einen Senatssitz von Connecticut bei den Senatswahlen vom 7. November 2006. In den parteiinternen Vorwahlen, die die Kandidatur festlegen, besiegte er den Amtsinhaber Joe Lieberman. Lamont ist Erbe eines Millionenvermögens und Angehöriger exklusiver Country Clubs, was zu Heucheleivorwürfen im Wahlkampf führte. Jedoch verfehlte er den Einzug in den Senat. Er unterlag Lieberman, der als unabhängiger Kandidat 50 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen errang und damit den Wiedereinzug in den Senat schaffte. Lamont kam nur auf 40 Prozent der Stimmen. Viele Anhänger der Republikanischen Partei gaben Lieberman ihre Stimme und versagten dem republikanischen Kandidaten Alan Schlesinger die Gefolgschaft. Lieberman wurden allgemein größere Chancen als Schlesinger eingeräumt, Lamont zu schlagen. Außerdem gilt Lieberman als wertkonservativ und war so für viele Anhänger der Republikaner wählbar. Im November 2009 kündigte Lamont an, dass er eventuell für die Gouverneurswahlen 2010 in Connecticut kandidieren wolle; im Februar 2010 reichte er seine Kandidatur offiziell bei der Demokratischen Partei ein. Auf einem Parteitag im Mai 2010 unterlag er seinem internen Herausforderer Dan Malloy deutlich. Da Lamont aber die interne Hürde von 15 Prozent der Parteitagsstimmen klar schaffte, konnte er an den Vorwahlen der Demokraten vom 10. August 2010 dennoch teilnehmen, wo er aber ebenfalls klar gegen seinen Konkurrenten Malloy verlor.",

His positions after the war included Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for twenty-three years, and member of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland, to which he was appointed in 1946. He was shot and killed (aged 86), along with his son, James (aged 48), by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1981 at Tynan Abbey, their home, which was burnt to the ground during the attack.",

  "text" : "Gaius Julius Caesar (Classical Latin: [ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar]; 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence. After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\", giving him additional authority. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Marcus Junius Brutus. A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.",

  "text" : "John Jeremy Thorpe, PC (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the Liberal Party between 1967 and 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, based on his earlier relationship with Norman Scott, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and the furore surrounding it, ended his political career. Thorpe was the son and grandson of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with neither of the main parties attaining a majority (\"Hung parliament\"), Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government. The February 1974 election proved to be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence on the grounds that the prosecution had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.",

Smallwood abandoned his youthful socialism and collaborated with bankers, turning against the militant unions that sponsored numerous strikes. The results of his efforts to promote industrialization were mixed, with the most favourable results in hydroelectricity, iron mining and paper mills. Smallwood was charismatic and controversial. Never shy, he dubbed himself \"the last Father of Confederation.\" While many Canadians today remember Smallwood as the man who brought Newfoundland into the Canadian Confederation, the opinion held by Newfoundlanders and their diaspora remains sharply divided as to his legacy.",

  "text" : "John Hutchyns Tyndall' (14 July 1934 – 19 July 2005) was a British National Socialist. As a prominent figure in British nationalism during the second half of the twentieth century, Tyndall was involved during the 1960s with neo-Nazi movements, most notably being the deputy leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement under Colin Jordan. However, he is best known for leading the National Front (NF) in the late 1970s and founding the contemporary British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Born in Devon, Tyndall undertook national service prior to reading the work of Adolf Hitler and involving himself in extreme-right politics. In the mid-1950s he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Growing frustrated with the LEL's approach, in 1957 he co-founded the National Labour Party (NLP) with John Bean. In 1960 the NLP merged with Colin Jordan's White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Tyndall grew close to Jordan and together they embraced an overt Neo-Nazi approach to racial nationalism, establishing a paramilitary group called Spearhead. Bean and other BNP members were unhappy with this and expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement. In 1962 he was convicted and imprisoned for establishing a paramilitary organisation. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall then formed his Greater Britain Movement, another explicitly Neo-Nazi group, in 1964. In 1967 Tyndall joined the newly established National Front, which was then led by Chesterton. He took on the role of Vice Chairman and eventually assumed the position of Chairman in 1972. His leadership was however threatened by both a 'populist moderate' faction and a Strasserite faction. In 1974 he was deposed as Chairman and briefly expelled from the party the following year. On his return he resumed his position as Chairman, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980, forming his short-lived New National Front. In 1982 he established the new British National Party, which grew into the most prominent extreme-right group in the UK by the late 1980s. Electoral success however largely eluded the party. Tyndall's refusal to moderate any of the party's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of 'modernisers', who succeeded in ousting him in 1999, when he was replaced by Nick Griffin. Tyndall retained his affiliation with the BNP for the following few years prior to his death.",

De Witt controlled the Netherlands political system from around 1650 until shortly before his death in 1672 working with various factions from nearly all the major cities, especially his hometown, Dordrecht, and the city of birth of his wife, Amsterdam. As a republican he opposed the House of Orange. He was also strongly liberal, preferring lesser power to the central government and more power to the regenten. However, his negligence of the Dutch land army (as the regents focused only on merchant vessels, thinking they could avoid war) proved disastrous when the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar. In the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of three countries, he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague.",

  "text" : "Jonathan Jennings (March 27, 1784 – July 26, 1834) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine-term congressman from Indiana. Born in either Hunterdon County, New Jersey, or Rockbridge County, Virginia, he studied law before immigrating to the Indiana Territory in 1806. Jennings initially intended to practice law, but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at Vincennes and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself, and pursued interests in land speculation and politics. Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career. In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near Charlestown, in Clark County. He was elected as the Indiana Territory's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro-Harrison supporters and running as an anti-Harrison candidate. By 1812 he was the leader of the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction of the territorial government. Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812. As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the Enabling Act in 1816, which authorized the organization of Indiana's state government and state constitution. He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention, held in Corydon in June 1816, where he helped draft the state's first constitution. Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government. In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements. Jennings had been a heavy drinker of alcohol for much of his life. His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife, Ann, and his development of rheumatism. Jennings's alcoholism led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830. In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm. When his finances collapsed, his creditors sought to take his land holdings and Charlestown farm. To protect his friend, U.S. Senator John Tipton purchased Jennings's farm and permitted him to continue living there. After Jennings's death, his estate was sold, but it left no funds to purchase a headstone for his grave, which remained unmarked for fifty-seven years. Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings's life and impact on the development of Indiana. Early state historians, Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. and William Wesley Woollen, gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro-slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state. More critical historians during the prohibition era, such as Logan Eseray, described Jennings as a crafty and self-promoting politician and focused on his alcoholism. Among the modern historians, Randy Mills places Jennings's importance between the two extremes, but agreed with Woolen's assessment that the state \"owes him more than she can compute.\"",

  "text" : "(\"John Maud\" redirects here. For the bishop, see John Maud (bishop).) John Primatt Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud GCB CBE (3 February 1906 – 20 November 1982) was a British civil servant and diplomat. Born in Bristol, Maud was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford. He gained a Second in Classical Moderations in 1928 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats') in 1928.At Oxford he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS). In 1928, he gained the one-year Henry P. Davison scholarship to Harvard University where he was awarded an A.B. in 1929. From 1929 to 1932 he was a Junior Research Fellow University College, Oxford and from 1932-39 Fellow (Praelector in Politics) and Dean of the college. He was awarded a Rhodes Travelling Scholarship to Africa in 1932 and held a University Lectureship in Politics at Oxford University, 1938-9. During World War II, he was Master of Birkbeck College and was also based at Reading Gaol, working for the Ministry of Food. He became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1942, and after the war, he worked at the Ministry of Education (1945–1952), rising to Permanent Secretary and then the Ministry of Fuel and Power until 1958. He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1946, and was raised to a Knight Grand Cross in 1955. Inter alia, Maud appeared on the BBC programme The Brains Trust in 1958. He was High Commissioner to the Union of South Africa from 1959 to 1961, and Ambassador from 1961, when the country became a republic and left the Commonwealth. In 1963, he became Master of University College, Oxford, where he had been a Fellow before the Second World War. In March 1964, Maud was appointed by Sir Keith Joseph, at the request of local council associations, to head a departmental committee looking into the management of local government. The Maud Committee reported three years later. During the course of the inquiry, Maud was chosen to head a Royal Commission on the reform of all local government in England. He was awarded a life peerage, hyphenating his surname to become Baron Redcliffe-Maud, of the City and County of Bristol in 1967. The Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England, popularly known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, was published in 1969. It advocated the wholesale reform of local council boundaries and the institution of large unitary councils based on the principle of mixing rural and urban areas. Accepted by the Labour government of Harold Wilson with minor changes, the opposition from rural areas convinced the Conservative opposition to oppose it and no further action was taken after the Conservatives won the 1970 general election. He retired as Master of University College in 1976, to be succeeded by the leading lawyer Lord Goodman. His 1973 portrait by Ruskin Spear can be seen in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Another portrait hangs in the Hall at University College in Oxford. Redcliffe-Maud was married to Jean Hamilton, who was educated at Somerville College, Oxford. His son, Humphrey Maud, was one of Benjamin Britten's favourite boys while he was at Eton. Sir John intervened to curtail Humphrey's frequent visits to stay with Britten on his own. The incident is described in John Bridcut's Britten's Children. John Redcliffe-Maud is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. His archive is held by the London School of Economics Library. Redcliffe-Maud House at the University College Annex known as \"Stavertonia\" in North Oxford is named in honour of him.",

  "text" : "Johan Skytte (Nyköping, 1577 – Söderåkra, 15 March 1645) was a Swedish politician. Skytte was son of the Mayor of Nyköping, Bengt Nilsson Skräddare. While attending school in his home town and for the nine years he was studying at foreign universities, he used the surname Schroderus, a Latinised form of the German Schröder – his father's surname – which means \"tailor\". Already at his return from his foreign studies in 1602, he was hired as tutor of the young Prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, the future king, and was ennobled the following year, taking the name Skytte after an extinct noble family from which he claimed descent on the maternal side. He was sent to London in 1610 on a diplomatic mission, an attempt to seek the hand of Elizabeth Stuart, the daughter of James I for the young prince. In 1611, he was made governor of Vestmannia, in 1617 a high councillor and in 1622 chancellor of Uppsala University, which he remained until his death. Skytte participated in drafting the 1617 Coronation Oath of king Gustav Adolf. Having in 1624 been created a baron (friherre), receiving the barony of Tuutarhovi in Ingria, Livonia, which had just been added to the Swedish Realm, and in 1629 appointed Governor-General of Livonia, Ingria and Karelia, he was in 1632 appointed chancellor of the new Academia Gustaviana (University of Tartu), in addition to his Uppsala chancellorship, and made plans for a new appellate court in Tartu (in today Estonia). In 1632, Skytte returned from Livonia and was in 1634 made president of the Göta appellate court (Göta hovrätt) in Jönköping. The same year he became chancellor of Uppsala University, 1622, Skytte donated the Skyttean professorship of Eloquence and Government to the university. His own house in Uppsala, the originally medieval building called the Skytteanum, is still used by Department of Government; the professor skytteanus/skytteana has his/her residence in an apartment in the house. Since 1995, the Skytte Foundation at Uppsala University awards an annual prize in Political Science (see Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science). Of the several schools in Sweden named after Skytte, one was actually founded on the initiative of Johan Skytte, the Skyttean school (Skytteanska skolan) which was established in Lycksele in Lapland in 1631, but moved to Tärnaby in 1867. Because of this contribution to education in the relatively under-developed northern Sweden, the Royal Skyttean Society in Umeå was named after him when it was established in 1956. He was parent to Vendela Skytte and Bengt Skytte.",

  "text" : "James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose KT CB CVO VD (1 May 1878 – 20 January 1954), was a Scottish nobleman, naval officer, politician and engineer. The eldest son of Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose, he was educated at Eton College. In 1906 he married Lady Mary Douglas-Hamilton, the only child of the 12th Duke of Hamilton. They had four children, Lord James Graham (later the 7th Duke), Lady Mary Graham, Lord Ronald Graham and Lady Jean Graham. As a mariner, he served in the Mercantile Marine and ASC in South Africa, during which time he obtained the first film ever taken of a total eclipse of the Sun during a Royal Astronomical Society expedition to India in 1899, and took part in a mission in 1900 for Lloyd's of London to the South African Government to establish wireless telegraphic stations on the coast. Having been instrumental in founding the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in 1903, he served in the Auxiliary Naval Service during World War I and was later Commodore of the RNVR Clyde Division, then the East Coast of Scotland RNVR, and fulfilled the role of Commodore of the entire RNVR from 1921 until he retired in 1927. As a result, from 1946 to 1968, whichever ship was attached to the Tay Division of the Royal Naval Reserve (in Dundee) was always temporarily renamed HMS Montrose after the 6th Duke. In 1992, the seventh Duke-class frigate HMS Montrose was so-named for the same reason. In his political life, he was unpaid Assistant Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1905, and Naval Aide-de-Camp to His Majesty. However, he was unsuccessful as the Scottish Unionist Party (effectively the Conservative Party in Scotland) parliamentary candidate for Stirlingshire in 1906, and as the Conservative Party candidate at the 1906 by-election at Eye, Suffolk, and at the subsequent general election in 1910; although holding the courtesy title of the Marquess of Graham from 1907 (when his father was the 5th Duke), he contested these elections as James Graham. He entered the House of Lords as the 6th Duke when he succeeded to the title in 1925. When the Home Rule movement decided to split from the avowedly anti-Home Rule Scottish Unionist Party in 1932, he became chairman of the new centre-right Scottish Party, and successfully steered it towards a merger with the centre-left National Party of Scotland in April 1934, therefore founding the modern Scottish National Party. He joined the Liberal Party in 1936. As an engineer, he was the inventor of the world's first naval aircraft carrier, when in 1912, as a director of William Beardmore and Company, of Dalmuir, he designed a 14,450 ton merchant vessel intended for delivery to the Lloyd Sabaudo Line of Italy as the SS Conte Rosso. When war broke out in 1914, work on the vessel ceased, but was resumed in 1916 as an aircraft carrier. The conversion work was completed in September 1918 and the vessel was commissioned as HMS Argus - recognised as the first ever \"flat top\". The Duke was also designer and owner of the first seagoing heavy oil motorship. He was President of the British Institution of Marine Engineers in 1911, and President of the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1916 and 1917. Afterwards, he was Vice-President of the Institution of Naval Architects, a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a Trustee for the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, a Member of the Royal Company of Archers, and Commodore of the Sea Cadets in Scotland. In 1935 he became the second President on the National Institute for the Deaf, a post he held until his death.",

  "text" : "John Shields Tipton (* 14. August 1786 bei Sevierville, Tennessee; † 5. April 1839 in Logansport, Indiana) war ein US-amerikanischer Armeeoffizier und Politiker (Demokratische Partei). Er vertrat den Bundesstaat Indiana im US-Senat. Der im heutigen Sevier County geborene Tipton verlor schon früh seinen Vater, der von Indianern getötet wurde. Sein Großonkel, der ebenfalls John Tipton hieß, gehörte zu den prominenten Persönlichkeiten des Gebietes, weshalb er zeitweise zum Ziel von Aktionen der Anhänger eines von Tennessee unabhängigen State of Franklin wurde. Als er 17 Jahre alt war, zog John Tipton ins Harrison County im Indiana-Territorium. Dort heiratete er 1806 Martha Shields; die Ehe wurde 1816 geschieden. Er wurde in seiner neuen Heimat als Farmer tätig und trat einer Miliz bei, die ihn und andere Siedler vor Indianerangriffen schützen sollte. Während der Schlacht bei Tippecanoe kommandierte er die Kompanie der Yellow Jackets; später standen die Indiana Rangers im Britisch-Amerikanischen Krieg unter seinem Befehl. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt bekleidete Tipton den Rang eines Majors. Nach dem Friedensschluss wurde er zum Brigadegeneral befördert. In der Folge schlug Tipton eine politische Laufbahn ein. Er war von 1819 bis 1823 Abgeordneter im Repräsentantenhaus von Indiana; während dieser Zeit gründete er die heutige Stadt Columbus, die ursprünglich den Namen Tiptonia trug. Er gehörte Kommissionen an, in denen über die neue Staatshauptstadt diskutiert wurde, und beteiligte sich an der Beilegung von Grenzstreitigkeiten zwischen Indiana und Illinois. 1823 wurde er United States Indian Agent und führte in dieser Funktion offizielle Verhandlungen mit den Stämmen der Potawatomi und der Miami. Als die Gespräche mit den Potawatomi nicht erfolgreich verliefen, leitete Tipton deren gewaltsame Umsiedlung ins heutige Kansas ein; die Aktion, die mehr als 40 Indianer das Leben kostete, wurde unter dem Namen Potawatomi Trail of Death bekannt. Tipton, der 1825 ein zweites Mal geheiratet hatte, wurde im Jahr 1831 von der Indiana General Assembly zum Nachfolger des verstorbenen US-Senators James Noble gewählt; zwischenzeitlich hatte Robert Hanna dessen Mandat kommissarisch wahrgenommen. Am 9. Dezember 1831 zog Tipton in den Senat ein, wo er nach einer Wiederwahl im folgenden Jahr bis zum 3. März 1839 verblieb. Während dieser Zeit war er unter anderem Vorsitzender des Committee on Roads and Canals sowie des Committee on Indian Affairs. Aus gesundheitlichen Gründen verzichtete er auf eine erneute Kandidatur; zwei Wochen nach seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Senat verstarb er in Logansport, einer von ihm mitbegründeten Stadt. Das Tipton County in Indiana und dessen Verwaltungssitz Tipton sind nach John Tipton benannt.",

Taylor's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1849 and he was a sheep farmer in various parts of the South Island before finally settling on a run near Riverton in Southland, where he had his homestead 'Waldeck' built. He entered the House of Representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate through a by-election in 1858 but fell out with many of his constituents over a broken election promise, as he helped the Southland Province to break away from the Otago Province. He eventually became Southland's second Superintendent and served from 1865 to 1869, and also represented an electorate on the Southland Provincial Council for a few months. In 1865, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council and with one break in membership due to non-attendance, he remained a member until his death. He served for one year as mayor of Riverton (1872–73) but did not stand again due to poor health. Taylor had a painful illness and died in 1875.",

Several years later, he moved to Buffalo and established his commission and malting businesses there. Manning was elected mayor in a special election held on January 9, 1883, as the Democratic candidate. He continued the string of vetoes begun by Mayor Grover Cleveland; they saved the city a great financial loss. Manning retired from politics after losing his campaign for re-election. He continued to grow and expand the malting business and built several grain elevators in the 1890s, each with a large storage capacity. On May 30, 1902, the largest fire Black Rock had ever seen consumed Manning's Frontier Canada plant. He died on April 28, 1908 at Brooklyn, New York and is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery.",

He was a Commissioner on the Cook County Board of Review, a property tax assessment appeal panel. Throughout his career, Berrios combined government sector jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, and private sector proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales. His political campaign strategies included ballot access challenges to potential opponents. He has been the focus of investigations into allegations of ethics violations and political corruption with respect to campaign fund-raising and nepotism. In the press and in the courts, Berrios has repeatedly defended his right as an elected official to hire relatives and to accept campaign contributions from those with business before his office.",

  "text" : "Джарруллах Алалувайт (араб. جار الله العلويط‎) — командующий стратегическими ракетными силами Саудовской Аравии с 2013 года, генерал-майор. Начиная с 2013 года его имя, звание и фотографии не секретны, а открыты для печати, так же как и информации о существовании стратегических ракетных сил как отдельного рода войск Саудовской Аравии. В частности, он лично открывал в июле 2013 года новый штаб и академию стратегических ракетных сил в Эр-Рияде, столице Саудовской Аравии. Генерал-майор Джарралла Алалувайт по-видимому является единственным командующим стратегических ракетных сил (как отдельного рода войск) среди арабских и исламских стран. Пакистан также имеет стратегические баллистические ракеты, но они не сведены в отдельный род войск, а находятся в подчинении у пакистанской армии в виде отдельного корпуса (командование Стратегическими Силами Армии (англ.)). Пост командующего стратегическими ракетными силами становится в настоящее время всё более важным с учетом ядерной программы Саудовской Аравии, которая была ускорена с 2009 года согласно заявлениям короля Саудовской Аравии Абдуллы и принца Турки ибн Файсал Аль Сауда.",

Zhong Hui rose to prominence in the 250s when he became a close aide to Sima Zhao, the regent and de facto ruler of Wei. He advised Sima Zhao on how to deal with the Third Rebellion in Shouchun from 257–258 and was highly regarded by the latter. With Sima Zhao's help, Zhong Hui steadily moved up the ranks and became one of the key figures in the Wei government. In 263, the Wei imperial court ordered Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead separate armies to attack and conquer Wei's rival state, Shu Han. During and after the campaign against Shu, Zhong Hui framed Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu for treason and cowardice respectively, thereby eliminating them and putting himself in full control of all the Wei forces in Shu by the time Shu surrendered to Wei. In 264, with backing from Jiang Wei, a former Shu general, Zhong Hui started a rebellion against Sima Zhao. However, the revolt failed when Zhong Hui's plan to purge several Wei officers – because he was worried that they would not support him – was leaked out. The officers escaped from custody, regrouped with their men, mutinied against Zhong Hui, and killed him and Jiang Wei.",

  "text" : "Erich Honecker (German: [ˈeːʁɪç ˈhɔnɛkɐ]; 25 August 1912 – 29 May 1994) was a German politician who, as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, led the German Democratic Republic from 1971 until the weeks preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. From 1976 onward he was also the country's official head of state as chairman of the State Council following Willi Stoph's relinquishment of the post. Honecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned during the Nazi era. Following World War II, he was freed and soon relaunched his political activities, founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955. As the Security Secretary of the Party’s Central Committee in the new East German state, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore responsibility for the \"order to fire\" along the Inner German border. In 1971, he initiated a political power struggle that led, with Soviet support, to his replacing Walter Ulbricht as First Secretary of the Central Committee and as chairman of the state's National Defense Council. Under his command, the country adopted a programme of \"consumer socialism\" and moved toward the international community by normalising relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN, in what is considered one of his greatest political successes. As Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s under the liberalising reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system and was consequently forced to resign by his party in October 1989 as the Communist regime sought to retain its power. Honecker's eighteen years at the helm of the soon-to-collapse German Democratic Republic came to an end. Following German reunification, he escaped to the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991 but was extradited back to Germany a year later to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuses committed by the East German regime. However, the proceedings were abandoned due to illness and he was freed from custody to travel to join his family in exile in Chile, where he died in May 1994 from liver cancer.",

  "text" : "Emmeline Pankhurst (née Goulden; 15 July 1858 – 14 June 1928) was a British political activist and leader of the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote. In 1999 Time named Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating: \"she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back.\" She was widely criticised for her militant tactics, and historians disagree about their effectiveness, but her work is recognised as a crucial element in achieving women's suffrage in Britain. Born in Moss Side, Manchester to politically active parents, Pankhurst was introduced at the age of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years her senior known for supporting women's right to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her sex. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses. In 1903, five years after her husband died, Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an all-women suffrage advocacy organisation dedicated to \"deeds, not words.\" The group identified as independent from – and often in opposition to – political parties. It became known for physical confrontations: its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers. Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists received repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions. As Pankhurst's eldest daughter Christabel took leadership of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew. Eventually the group adopted arson as a tactic, and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family. In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU, among them Pankhurst's daughters Adela and Sylvia. Emmeline was so furious that she \"gave [Adela] a ticket, £20, and a letter of introduction to a suffragette in Australia, and firmly insisted that she emigrate.\" Adela complied and the family rift was never healed. Sylvia became a socialist. With the advent of the First World War, Emmeline and Christabel called an immediate halt to militant suffrage activism in support of the British government's stand against the \"German Peril.\" They urged women to aid industrial production and encouraged young men to fight, becoming prominent figures in the white feather movement. In 1918 the Representation of the People Act granted votes to all men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30. This discrepancy was intended to ensure that men did not become minority voters as a consequence of the huge number of deaths suffered during the First World War.Pankhurst transformed the WSPU machinery into the Women's Party, which was dedicated to promoting women's equality in public life. In her later years, she became concerned with what she perceived as the menace posed by Bolshevism and joined the Conservative Party and was selected as a Conservative Party candidate for Stepney in 1927. She died on 14 June 1928, only weeks before the Conservative government's Representation of the People Act (1928) extended the vote to all women over 21 years of age on 2 July 1928. She was commemorated two years later with a statue in London's Victoria Tower Gardens.",

  "text" : "Ehsan Jafri (1929 – 28 February 2002) was an Indian politician and former member of the 6th Lok Sabha for the Congress Party, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, which was one of the episodes of mob violence against Muslims during the 2002 Gujarat riots. It has been alleged that on February 28th 2002, he was killed by a mob armed with machetes when he pleaded with them to spare the lives of the women and children who had taken refuge in his home. The Special Investigating Team concluded that he was killed after he fired at an agitated mob outside his house. His widow Zakia Jafri has subsequently argued that the state of Gujarat and its then Chief Minister, now the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, was partly responsible for the violence and for the lack of police intervention in favor of the victims at Gulbarg Society. This argument has been rejected by a Special Investigation Committee which concluded that Modi had no responsibility for the incident.",

In 1799, he graduated from Williams College, then made his way to Oneida County, New York where he studied law. In 1806, he was admitted to the New York State bar and moved to Buffalo. For nearly two years Walden was the only lawyer west of Batavia. He invested heavily in real estate in this area, owning what became known as Walden Farm at what is now Fillmore and Walden Avenue. In 1812, he married Suzanna Marvin. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Cattaraugus, Chautauqua and Niagara Co.) in 1812. During the War of 1812 Walden leased land to the Federal government and the Buffalo Barracks are erected. The front portion of the barracks later became what is the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site. He was one of the few who stayed behind during the burning of Buffalo and trying to save as many lives as possible. Walden's home was used by General Winfield Scott as his headquarters. After the war, he erected the first brick dwelling in Buffalo. He was one of the four original trustees of the village of Buffalo and served as a member of the Buffalo Harbor Company, which improved Buffalo's harbor to attract the village as the western terminus of the Erie Canal. Walden became the first judge of Erie County Court in 1823 and held the position for five years. He was a presidential elector in 1828. On March 13, 1838, the Common Council met and made Walden its choice for mayor. During his term, the entire school system was reorganized. After his term as mayor, Walden retired to his farm in Lake View, New York. He died there on November 10, 1857, and was buried in the Myer-Walden mausoleum in Forest Lawn Cemetery.",

Electors from Waiuku presented a requisition to Hamlin in November 1869 to stand for election in the Raglan electorate for the Auckland Provincial Council, which he accepted. Three representatives were elected on 20 December, and of four candidates, Joseph May came first and Hamlin came second. Hamlin remained a member of the provincial council until the abolition of provincial government in 1875. He represented the South Auckland seats of Franklin in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1876 to 1881; and then the replacement electorate of Franklin South from 1881 to 1890. He then represented the reconstituted Franklin electorate from 1890 to 1893 when he retired. He was never defeated. He served as Chairman of Committees from 1882 to 1890.

  "text" : "Edgerton Winnett Day (November 26, 1863 – February 11, 1919) was a Canadian politician and pioneer settler in the area that became province of Alberta, Canada. Born in 1863 in an area later incorporated into the Canadian province of Ontario, Day completed his education, and took up a job as a stagecoach driver. Soon after, he would find employment at the Massey-Harris company, an agricultural equipment manufacturer. During this time, Day first surveyed the land that he would eventually settle later on in his life. After briefly working as a loan company, Day moved to the west, after having aspirations of doing so since his youth. As the Canadian Pacific Railway gained entitlement to a portion of land in the prairies, Day became interested in purchasing a large portion, and did so in 1904. He then completed plans for what would later become the town that bears his name, Daysland, in present-day Flagstaff County, Alberta. Daysland was formed in 1905, when the railway line to the area was completed. Soon after, a large colonial-style house was built as a home for Day and his wife. Fitted with the latest appliances and technology at the time, it soon became the centre of the town, serving as an ice rink and tennis court, and hosting events, including auctions. After the opening of a post office in 1907, Daysland was officially incorporated as a town, with Day elected its first mayor. He would continue to serve in the capacity until his resignation in 1910. Two years later, Day moved to Edmonton, where he served as a major in the Army Reserve until his death from a long illness in 1919.",

  "text" : "Ernst Carel Bakker (Hellendoorn, 16 april 1946 – Hilversum, 8 februari 2014)  was een Nederlands politicus voor D66. Hij studeerde rechten en sociologie maar behaalde geen academische graden in deze wetenschappelijke disciplines. Van 1971 tot 1978 was hij werkzaam als fractiemedewerker bij de toenmalige Tweede Kamerfractie van D66, van 1978 tot 1981 assisteerde Bakker als zodanig Jan Terlouw die destijds als fractieleider D66 in de Tweede Kamer aanvoerde. Tijdens de laatstgenoemde periode was hij ook lid van de gemeenteraad van Amsterdam. Voorts leidde hij van 1974 tot 1990 de verkiezingscampagnes voor D66, onder meer de zeer succesvol verlopen campagne van 1981 voor de Tweede Kamer. Hij kwam vervolgens zelf in de Tweede Kamer terecht waarbij hij zijn pijlen onder andere richtte op binnenlandse zaken en verkeer- en waterstaatsaangelegenheden. Nadat de PvdA uit het toenmalige Kabinet-Van Agt II was gestapt, stemde hij in een in mei 1982 gehouden fractievergadering tegen de vorming van een interim-kabinet bestaande uit zijn partij met het CDA, de andere overgebleven partij.Na de voor D66 tegengevallen verkiezingsuitslag van september 1982 moest hij de Kamer verlaten en werd hij beleidsadviseur op het gebied van bestuurlijke contacten. In 1990 werd Bakker opnieuw gemeenteraadslid van Amsterdam en vanaf 1992 ook wethouder van deze gemeente om in 1998 deze post te verruilen voor die van het burgemeesterschap van de gemeente Hilversum. In 2010 besloot hij op 1 juli 2011 met pensioen te zullen gaan. Daarna is hij opgevolgd door Pieter Broertjes. Bij zijn afscheid werd burgemeester Bakker ingeschreven in het Hilversumse Gulden Boek en ontving hij een Gouden Legpenning.",

  "text" : "Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 – October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer and corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin. Willkie was born in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was initially employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C&S), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C&S, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C&S. Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C&S's property for a good price, and gained public esteem. A longtime Democratic activist, Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939. He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters – many youthful – enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces under Hitler rampaged through western Europe in 1940, many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions towards the end of the race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states. After the election, Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's informal envoy, and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.",

  "text" : "William Wilberforce (24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833) was an English politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to eradicate the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he became an Evangelical Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform. In 1787, he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad. In later years, Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.",

His parents were Ernst Graf von Mirbach and his wife Wilhelmine von Thun-Hohenstein (1851–1929). From 1908 to 1911, Mirbach served as the embassy clerk in Saint Petersburg, and then as political councillor for the German military command in Bucharest. In 1915 he became the German ambassador in Greece, before being expelled from Athens in December 1916 when the Entente-leaning government of Eleftherios Venizelos took power. He participated in the Russian-German negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from December 1917 to March 1918. He was appointed German ambassador to Russia in April 1918. Mirbach was assassinated by Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin at the request of the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who tried to incite a war between Russia and Germany. Blumkin entered Mirbach's residence in Moscow using forged papers and shot his victim at point blank range. Mirbach's assassination signaled the beginning of the revolt of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow in 1918. Mirbach was succeeded as German ambassador to Russia by Karl Helfferich. Coincidentally, a later relative, Andreas von Mirbach, would be murdered by the Red Army Faction at the West German Embassy siege in Stockholm in 1975.",

  "text" : "William Thorne Buckland (1819 – 17 January 1876) was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in New Zealand. Buckland was born in 1819 or 1820. His mother was Elizabeth (née Mortimore) and his father was the broker John Buckland; they were from Devon, England. The auctioneer Alfred Buckland was a younger brother. Buckland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 from South Australia, and was a butcher in Auckland, then a farmer in the Waikato. He married Susan Channing on 13 April 1843 at St Paul's Church in Auckland. Buckland was appointed to the Auckland Executive Council of the Auckland Province in November 1856 (the source does not state and end date), and was again appointed from February to July 1857. He was elected to the Auckland Provincial Council for the Raglan electorate in November 1861 and served until 1869. From 1869 to 1873, he represented the Franklin electorate. He had no intention of standing for the Provincial Council again but happened to ride past the nomination meeting in Newmarket for the Eden electorate. There was only one nomination thus far for the two available positions, and Buckland was talked into being nominated. As the number of nominations matched the number of available positions, he was declared elected unopposed, and served until his death. He represented two South Auckland electorates; first the Raglan electorate from 1865 to 1866, when he retired. He then represented the Franklin electorate from 1871 to 1875. He was nominated for the 1876 election and gave a speech at the nomination meeting on 10 January 1876, but withdrew his nomination before the end of the proceedings. The Auckland Star suggested that the sole purpose of his nomination was that he could make a speech in opposition to Sir George Grey. Buckland left for the Waikato immediately afterwards to support Alfred Cox in his candidacy in the Waipa electorate. However, he became ill with symptoms of heat stroke and returned to his home in Remuera. He died at his home in Remuera, Auckland aged 56 years after that brief illness. He was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in Parnell. His wife had died in September 1871; she had committed suicide after having become depressed. Their sons Frank and John Channing Buckland were both elected to the parliament in the 1884 election. Jessie Buckland was his son John's daughter.",

He holds the title of Florida's longest-serving state legislator. He earned the nickname \"Banty Rooster\" – after the diminutive, swaggering barnyard fowl – and became known for his eccentric mannerisms and colorful, folksy expressions. Childers was popular in his district for the ample state funding and \"turkey\" projects he sent home, including $12.5 million for the Pensacola Civic Center and the I-110 extension to Gregory Street. Initially a Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party in 1995. After term limits forced him from the Florida Senate in 2000, Childers ran for the District 1 seat of the Escambia County Commission. He became embroiled in the soccer complex corruption scandal and was found guilty of violating the Florida Sunshine Law and of bribing Commissioner Willie Junior to help push the purchases of two properties, totaling $6.2 million, from Childers' associates Joe and Georgann Elliott. Childers served nearly three years of a 42-month prison sentence in West Palm Beach and was released on 17 June 2009, after which he relocated away from Pensacola. On 8 June 2010, a federal appeals court overturned the bribery conviction, ruling that Childers' constitutional right to confront his accuser had been violated, as the defense team was not allowed to question Junior on his change of testimony.",

Shelly's bakery was known for its \"Four-X bread\". During the 1920s, he helped create a conglomerate known as Canadian Bakeries Ltd. to which he sold his business. Shelly became vice-president and general manager of the new company. He was also president of the Home Oil Co. Ltd., Canada Grain Export Co. Ltd., Guaranty Savings and Loan, Crescent Beach Development Co. Ltd., Grouse Mountain Highway and Scenic Resort Ltd. and the Shelly Building. Shelly served as finance minister in the provincial cabinet. In the fiscal year 1929/1930, the province suffered a fairly small deficit of $135,000. Shelly projected an increase of government revenues and a small surplus for the following fiscal year; instead, revenues decreased and expenditures were larger than projected, resulting in a then-record deficit of $4.8 million. Shelly was transferred to the position of president of the Executive Council in October 1930. He also suffered a large personal financial loss when share prices for Home Oil Co. Ltd. bottomed out in the years following the stock market crash. He retired from politics in 1933. Shelly died in Vancouver at the age of 72.",

  "text" : "William John Harper (22 July 1916 – 8 September 2006) was a politician, general contractor and Royal Air Force fighter pilot who served as a Cabinet minister in Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from 1962 to 1968, and signed that country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from Britain in 1965. Born into a prominent Anglo-Indian merchant family in Calcutta, Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937. He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of \"The Few\" in the Battle of Britain, during which he was wounded in action. Appalled by Britain's granting of independence to India in 1947, he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the air force two years later. Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended, and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland, reportedly declaring that it, South Africa and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would \"be under white rule forever\". He entered politics with the Dominion Party in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the Rhodesian Front (RF) government in 1962. The head of a far-right group within the RF, he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt \"a form of political apartheid\". When the Prime Minister Winston Field resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to Ian Smith, who moved him to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90.",

In 1879, he partnered with his brother and John Bruce to form Robbie and Bruce, a supplier of cut stones located at First and Broadway in Chico. It would later be renamed the Chico Granite and Marble Works, and later Chico Marble Works. As mayor, he oversaw the building of the old City Hall which was dedicated in 1911. He also accepted the deed to Children's Playground from Annie Bidwell in 1911.

As president of the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) during this important period of transition, he worked closely with Alliance Party leader Tunku Abdul Rahman and they developed a close personal bond. He is credited with three important developments in Malaysian political history: the consolidation of the Malayan (now Malaysian) Indian Congress, its transformation into a mass-based party, and its integral role as a partner in the current ruling alliance. The entry of the MIC into the multi-communal Alliance in 1955 contributed greatly to enhancing the coalition's image as the main representative of the three main communities in Malaya. The finest hour was achieved on 31 August 1957 when Independence was achieved under the Merdeka Agreement, to which Sambanthan was a signatory.",

Born in Singleton, New South Wales and educated at Shore School, Treatt interrupted his studies at the University of Sydney to enlist at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving in the Royal Australian Artillery, Treatt served in France and was awarded the Military Medal. Upon returning to Australia he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and further educated at New College, Oxford. After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt returned to Australia and was admitted to the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the Challis law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941. During this time Treatt witnessed the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, and then the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving eight years and almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984.",

Sampla, who studied till Class 10, joined the party in 1998. He is the second minister from Punjab after Akali Dal's Harsimrat Kaur Badal. His political journey began after he was elected the Sarpanch or head of his Sofi village (Jalandhar District). He has held several key posts in the BJP's Punjab unit. When he was a 27-year-old bereaved dalit, Sampla was trying to find his feet against the oppressive landlords of Jalandhar's Sofi Pind. His brother and he were left to fend for themselves after their father's death and Sampla went off to Saudi Arabia in 1979 to work for a plumbing company. On his swearing-in as BJP's first minister from Punjab in NDA-II, he says, \"I often recall one incident that shaped my life. While I was in Saudi Arabian city of Damam, I was asked to clean human excreta and repair a bathroom. I was young and flatly refused to do the cleaning part while telling the building owner that I was a plumber. On my insistence, the man put on plastic gloves and cleaned the muck himself. It taught me the difference between oppression against dalits and the will to work\", Sampla recalled.",

Cincinnatus was regarded by the Romans, especially the aristocratic patrician class, as one of the heroes of early Rome and as a model of Roman virtue and simplicity. He was a persistent opponent of the plebeians. When his son, Caeso Quinctius, was convicted and condemned to death, Cincinnatus was forced to live in humble circumstances, working on his own small farm, until an invasion caused him to be called to serve Rome as dictator, an office which he resigned two weeks later, after completing his task of defeating the rival tribes of the Aequians, Sabines, and Volscians. His immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of the crisis has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, civic virtue, lack of personal ambition, and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, many of which are named in his honor.",

Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonized the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favor with the Chinese after their loss in the 1894 Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military mistakes and praise on the other for his success against the Taiping Rebellion, his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China's industrial and military modernization.

Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in Hanmer before moving to Ruthin School aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the Middle Temple in 1750 and being called to the Bar in 1756. Initially almost unemployed due to the lack of education and contacts which a university education would have provided, his business increased thanks to his friendships with John Dunning, who, overwhelmed with cases, allowed Kenyon to work many, and Lord Thurlow who secured for him the Chief Justiceship of Chester in 1780. He was returned as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hindon the same year, serving repeatedly as Attorney General under William Pitt the Younger. He effectively sacrificed his political career in 1784 to challenge the ballot of Charles James Fox, and was rewarded with a baronetcy; from then on he did not speak in the House of Commons, despite remaining an MP. On 27 March 1784 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, a job to which he dedicated himself once he ceased to act as an MP. He had previously practised in the Court of Chancery, and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said \"I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all\". On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work \"restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law\". He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802.",

  "text" : "Leszek Moczulski (Polish pronunciation: [ˈlɛʂɛk mɔˈtʂulskʲi], born 7 June 1930) is a Polish historian and politician, a member of various organizations, first supporting then supposedly opposing the communist regime in the People's Republic of Poland while dividing the opposition movement. Leszek Moczulski was born June 7, 1930 in Warsaw. Shortly after the war and the Communist take-over of power in Poland, Moczulski became involved in various communist organizations. In 1947 he became a member of the Association of Fighting Youth and the following year he became the member of the Polish Workers' Party and the ZMP youth organization. Then since 1950 young Moczulski was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP). In 1951 he graduated from the Academy of Political Studies, a school of cadres for the communist regime. The following year he graduated also from the faculties of Law and Journalism at the Warsaw University. He completed his education in 1958 by graduating from the faculty of history at the same university. About that time he started to work as a journalist for various Warsaw-based newspapers and weeklies, among them the Życie Warszawy, Dookoła Świata and Stolica weekly. As a historian, Moczulski focused mostly on modern history of Poland, including the history of the Polish Defensive War. Initially, according to the Polish lustration court, a secret informer of the Służba Bezpieczeństwa secret political police, in late 1970s Moczulski most probably broke up (or just the opposite) with the regime and started working for various anti-communist associations. He was one of the inspirers of the creation and the spokesperson of the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights. Conflicted with the rest of the members, he tried to break it up by forming a ZINO faction, which was however unsuccessful. Finally, on September 1, 1979 Moczulski announced the creation of the Confederation of Independent Poland. As a politician, Moczulski referred to the rightist wing of the pre-war Sanacja and the supporters of Józef Piłsudski. In his political works he focused mostly on economical aspect of the possible transformation of Communist planned economy into free market economy. Among the most notable of his actions of the 1980s was a memorandum of February 1985, in which he urged the governments of United Kingdom and the United States to fulfill the promises of the Yalta Conference of 1945 and organise free elections in Poland. For such actions, Moczulski was arrested several times and held in prisons as a political prisoner. After the Round Table Talks and the peaceful transfer of power from the communist regime to the democratic authorities, Moczulski distanced himself from the agreement and openly criticised the idea of gruba kreska, instead supporting an idea of decommunization, a concept coined after the post-World War II de-nazification of Nazi Germany. He also stayed off the Solidarity movement. He failed to gain enough support in the Kraków-Podgórze constituency for his candidacy to the Sejm in the Contract elections of 1989. The following year he took part in the presidential elections scoring 2.50% of votes. In the Polish parliamentary elections of 1991 he became a member of the parliament. He held his post in the elections of 1993. During his membership, he was a president of various commissions, including the commissions responsible for foreign policies, for support of Polonia, as well as the commission working on the project of the new constitution. Moczulski also took part in the presidential election of 1995, though he withdrew his candidacy. In 1992, during the last days of the government of Jan Olszewski, Moczulski was accused by Antoni Macierewicz of being one of the secret agents of the Służba Bezpieczeństwa (SB), a communist secret police. In 1997 Moczulski himself asked the lustration tribunal to investigate the matter. However, contrary to his predictions, he was found guilty of hiding his collaboration with the SB during the period 1969-1977, which ended his political career.",

He had a column that appeared daily on the back page of the Dispatch called \"Cabbages and Kings,\" a reference to Lewis Carroll's poem, \"The Walrus and the Carpenter.\" He commonly wrote under the pen name \"Larry Ho.\" The name came about when he had written his first feature article for the Times. He was signing his name, \"Larry Hodgson,\" but his pencil broke after the first \"o.\" The city editor, James Gray, reportedly said, \"Better let it go at that–'Larry Ho.'\" He served as secretary to both St. Paul mayors Winn Powers and Vivian R. Irvin, and upon the expiration of Irvin's term, he was elected mayor by a large majority. He served two non-consecutive terms as mayor from 1918 to 1922, and from 1926 to 1930. Hodgson also ran for governor in 1920, but came third in the race, garnering only 81,293 votes. After Hodgson's death in 1937, his son, Laurence K.

He was the first to write history in Latin. He came of an ancient Plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome and began to follow the cursus honorum: he was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204 BC), aedile (199 BC), praetor (198 BC), junior consul (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and censor (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to preserve Rome's ancestral customs and combat \"degenerate\" Hellenistic influences. His epithet \"Elder\" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.",

His title was \"Cecil Calvert, Second Baron Baltimore, First Lord Proprietary, Earl Palatine of the Provinces of Maryland and Avalon in America\". He received the proprietorship after the death of his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (15 April 1632), for whom it had been intended. Cecil Calvert established and managed the Province of Maryland from his home, Kiplin Hall, in North Yorkshire, England. As an English Roman Catholic, he continued the legacy of his father by promoting religious tolerance in the colony. Maryland became a haven for Catholics in the New World, particularly important at a time of religious persecution in England. Calvert governed Maryland for forty-two years. He also continued to be Lord Proprietor and Governor of Newfoundland for the colony of Avalon. He died in England on 30 November 1675, aged 70 years. He is thought to be buried at St. Giles-in-the-Fields Church, London, UK. The exact location of his grave is unknown, but parish records state he is buried there. A plaque commemorating Cecil Calvert was placed in St. Giles in 1996 by the Governor of Maryland. However, genealogists for Kiplin Hall state, \"A number of the early Calverts were buried at St Giles in the Fields, Charing Cross Road, London. We cannot yet be certain whether Cecil is one of them.\" This is possibly due to poor record keeping of Catholic burials or numerous outbreaks of disease that overwhelmed burial staff and led to confusion in parish registers .",

  "text" : "Charles-Melchior Arthus, Marquis de Bonchamps (10 May 1760 – 18 October 1793) was a French politician and leader of the Vendéan insurrection of Royalists against the Republic during the French Revolution. Born at Juvardeil, Anjou, he gained his first military experience in the American War of Independence, and on his return to France was made a captain of grenadiers in the French royal army. He was a staunch defender of the French monarchy, and at the outbreak of the Revolution, resigned his command and retired to his château at Saint-Florent-le-Vieil. Shortly before the revolution broke out, Bonchamps feared for his king and country and requested to be reinstated. In the spring of 1793 he was chosen leader by the insurgents of the Vendée, and his directives were able to secure a large amount of supplies and weapons that would greatly aid the counterrevolution. He was present at the taking of Bressuire, Thouars, and of Fontenay-le-Comte - where he was wounded but recovered. Dissensions among their leaders weakened the insurgents, and at the bloody battle of Cholet (October 1793) the Vendéans sustained a severe defeat and Bonchamps was mortally wounded. He died the next day. His last act was the pardoning of five thousand Republican prisoners, whom his troops had sworn to kill in revenge for his death. Bonchamps was one of the best tactical leaders of the Vendéans and his death was an important victory for the republican forces. He was admired by the Christian monarchists and revolutionaries alike. A statue of him by Pierre Jean David stands in the church of Saint-Florent-le-Vieil.",

He had been his father's Deputy Governor since 1661 when he arrived in the colony at the age of 24. However, Charles left Maryland for England in 1684 and would never return. The events following the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688 would cost Calvert his title to Maryland; in 1689 the royal charter to the colony was withdrawn, leading to direct rule by the British Crown. Calvert's political problems were largely caused by his Roman Catholic faith which was at odds with the established Church of England. Calvert married four times, outliving three wives, and had at least two children. He died in England in 1715 at the age of 78, his family fortunes much diminished. With his death he passed his title, and his claim to Maryland, to his second son Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (1679–1715), his eldest son Cecil having died young. However, Benedict Calvert would outlive his father by just two months, and It would fall to Charles' grandson, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, (1699–1751), (who converted to the Anglican faith) to see the family proprietorship in Maryland restored by the king.",

  "text" : "(This article is about the Sinn Féin politician. For the American ice hockey player, see Connor Murphy.) Conor Terence Murphy (born 10 July 1963) is an Irish republican Sinn Féin politician who is the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland for Newry and Armagh. He served as the Member of Parliament for Newry and Armagh from 2005-2015. Murphy was born in Camlough, South Armagh and joined the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the 1981 hunger strikes. In 1982 he was sentenced to five years in prison for IRA membership and possession of explosives. Between 1989 and 1997, he was a Sinn Féin councillor on Newry and Mourne District Council for The Fews area, in South Armagh and South Down, and served as his party's group leader at that level. In 1998, Murphy was elected as one of his party's two Northern Ireland Assembly members for Newry and Armagh. He was re-elected, with two party colleagues, to the Assembly in 2003. He lives in Camlough, County Armagh with his wife Catherine, his daughter Áine and his son Oisín. He attended St Colman's College, Newry, Queen's University of Belfast (QUB), and the University of Ulster. In 2001, he contested the Newry and Armagh Westminster seat, coming second to incumbent Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). When Mallon decided not to contest the seat again, Murphy became the clear favourite to win and was elected on 5 May 2005. He refused to take his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in line with the abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin. In the Northern Ireland Assembly, he served as the Minister for Regional Development in the Northern Ireland Executive from 8 May 2007 until 16 May 2011. While on a tour of UK party conferences in autumn 2005, he became the first Irish republican to address the Conservative Party conference and caused controversy by refusing to express regret over the Brighton hotel bombing. In 2011, while Minister for Regional Development, Murphy appointed Sean Hogan, a Catholic, as head of Northern Ireland Water, turning down the applications of four Protestants on the shortlist. A tribunal subsequently awarded £150,000 damages for discrimination to one of these applicants, Alan Lennon, judging that Hogan was appointed because \"he was not from a Protestant background and because he was known to the minister and his (then Sinn Fein) ministerial colleagues Michelle Gildernew and Caitriona Ruane, who were consulted about the appointment.\" The tribunal found Murphy's evidence was \"implausible and lack[ing] credibility\", and that, during Murphy's tenure at the Department for Regional Development, there was a \"material bias against the appointment of candidates from a Protestant background\". Murphy disputed the finding which he said branded him \"sectarian\". Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness defended him, claiming Murphy doesn't have \"a sectarian bone in his body\". In December 2012, Murphy appeared as a witness at Belfast High Court in the case of Declan Gormley, whom Murphy had sacked in 2010 from his post as a non-executive director of NI Water. Gormley sued Sinn Féin over two press releases which he argued were defamatory. Gormley was subsequently offered £80,000 in damages.",

  "text" : "Carleton \"Carty\" S. Finkbeiner (born May 30, 1939, in Toledo, Ohio) is a Democratic Party (United States) politician who is the former mayor of Toledo, Ohio. First elected in 1993, he took office on January 1, 1994. In 1997, he defeated challenger Nick Wichowski to win a second term. Term limits prevented him from running a third consecutive time. He was succeeded by former mayor Jack Ford in 2002. Following his first administration, Finkbeiner served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board. He joined the ABC affiliate in Toledo and hosted Carty & Company, a Sunday morning public affairs show. He also contributed a weekly editorial segment, It's Just Not Right! Finkbeiner left WTVG in May 2005. On June 30, 2005, Finkbeiner announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. He won the Toledo mayoral primary, winning roughly 37% of the vote in comparison to 29% earned by incumbent Ford. On November 8, 2005, Finkbeiner was re-elected mayor. Finkbeiner was sworn in for his third term as mayor in a private ceremony on January 3, 2006. Finkbeiner has proved to be a very controversial mayor for the city of Toledo due to many of his policies, behavior, and public gaffes (see \"Controversy\" section). Toward the end of Finkbeiner's third term as mayor a recall effort drive to remove him from office was successfully put on the ballot but was ultimately struck down by the Ohio Supreme Court due to technicalities. Carty announced that his third run as mayor will be his final one and he would not seek re-election. According to city finance records verified by the Toledo Blade Finkbeiner left the city with a 48 million dollar deficit  which was inherited by Ohio Fire Marshall Michael P. Bell, an Independent, who succeeded Carty Finkbiener in 2010. Finkbeiner currently resides with his wife, Amy Finkbeiner, in South Toledo. He has three children: Ryan, Jenny, and Katie, and five grandchildren. Carlton Finkbeiner announced plans to run for a fourth term as mayor of Toledo on August 29, 2015.",

  "text" : "Charlotte Anne Laws (born May 11, 1960) is an American author, talk show host, community activist, animal rights advocate, anti-revenge porn activist, former Los Angeles politician, and actress under the stage name Missy Laws. Laws was a weekly commentator on the television show The Filter with Fred Roggin from August 2009 until 2013 when the show went off the air. One of her episodes was nominated for an Emmy. Laws was also a co-host on the Internet show Every Way Woman from 2008 - December 2013, and she hosted her own Los Angeles TV show called Uncommon Sense from October 2007 until September 2010. Laws and her guests discussed news and current events. Laws is a former member of the Greater Valley Glen Council in Valley Glen, California. She was termed out of office in 2012, after serving four two-year terms. She was the first politician to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an omniocracy, a government with representation for all living beings. In May 2006, Laws was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to serve on the city’s 912 Commission, which was also called the Neighborhood Council Review Commission. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Charter mandated that a commission would be formed seven years later to review the progress, successes and failures of the city’s Neighborhood Council system. Laws is the founder and president of two organizations: the Directors of Animal Welfare (DAW) and the League for Earth and Animal Protection (LEAP). In 2006, Laws was the recipient of the Los Angeles Animal Humanitarian Award. Laws is a vegan and an advocate of that diet.",

After serving as an independent member of the Chamber of Deputies for one mandate (1899-1903), he aligned his views with those of Take Ionescu, and became a supporter of Romania's entry into World War I alongside the Entente Powers.

In October 2014, she surpassed Kathy Sullivan's record for the longest period of parliamentary service by a woman. From July 2015, Bishop was subject to sustained intense media and public scrutiny regarding her use of parliamentary entitlements, including a helicopter charter to a party fundraiser during her time as speaker. Although Prime Minister Tony Abbott had originally been one of her strongest allies, she eventually lost his support, resigning from the speakership and moving to the backbench on 2 August to be replaced as speaker by Tony Smith. On 16 April 2016, Bishop was defeated by Jason Falinski in a Liberal Party preselection ballot (51 votes to 39) for the Division of Mackellar at the 2016 federal election.",

The 3rd Lord Baltimore was a devout Roman Catholic, and had lost his title to the Province of Maryland shortly after the events of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which saw the Protestant monarchs William and Mary accede to the British throne. Benedict Calvert would make strenuous attempts to have his family's title to Maryland restored by renouncing Roman Catholicism and joining the Church of England. In February 1715 Benedict became the 4th Baron Baltimore upon the death of his father, and he immediately petitioned King George I for the restoration of Maryland to his control. However, before the King could rule on the petition, Baltimore died aged 36, outliving his father by just two months. Shortly afterwards the King restored the title to Maryland to Calvert's young son Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.",

First elected to the Council in 1973, Stone was the second longest-serving alderman (after Edward M. Burke). His tenure spanned the terms of seven Mayors, from Richard J. Daley to Richard M. Daley. Stone was also Vice Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1998 to 2011. Stone was a member of the \"Vrdolyak 29\", which opposed Mayor Harold Washington's agenda. For most of his life a Democrat, Stone followed Alderman Edward Vrdolyak to the Republican Party, and unsuccessfully challenged Carol Moseley Braun for Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Stone was a protagonist in a protracted legal conflict with the neighboring suburb of Evanston in 1993–1994. Employees of Stone's 2007 re-election campaign were convicted of vote fraud in 2010. Stone was \"outspoken\" and \"relished the rough and tumble of politics\".",

In April 2007, Schlozman left the U.S. Attorney position to work at the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. Schlozman and his office came under review by Congressional and Senate investigators regarding the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys and alleged inappropriate politicization of the Civil Rights Division. The Department of Justice Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility alleged that Schlozman had violated the law and made false statements to Congress about his hiring decisions. While Schlozman testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that his personnel decisions were not based on party affiliation, the report cited emails and other communications in which Schlozman discussed hiring \"right-thinking Americans\" and ridding the Civil Rights Division of \"pinkos\", \"commies\", and attorneys perceived to be unacceptably liberal. Federal prosecutors, however, declined to file charges of criminal perjury against Schlozman, drawing criticism from Senate Democrats. Schlozman resigned from the Department of Justice on August 17, 2007, and accepted a position with the Hinkle Law Firm in Wichita, Kansas.",

In September 2009, Lambert made national headlines along with fellow Democratic Representative John Hennessy when an Associated Press photograph taken by photographer Jessica Hill depicting them playing solitaire on state-issued laptop computers during a budget hearing at the State Capitol was posted on the Internet. State House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, who was speaking on the Capitol floor at the time, said that the picture \"speaks for itself\" in regard to the legislators' priorities. Lambert retorted that she was \"still listening to [Cafero]\". On March 23, 2010, Lambert announced that she would not seek another term in the General Assembly.

His mother's identity is not known, though one source suggests Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham. As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the American Revolution.",

On 11 December 2014, he was appointed shadow Finance Minister of the Moderate Party and economic policy spokesperson. Previously he was one of the vice mayors in Stockholm. He was born in Skåne and grew up there and in Södermanland. After finishing secondary school at S:t Eskils gymnasium in Eskilstuna and completing a degree in economics at Uppsala University, he was elected chairman of the Moderate Youth League in 1988. When he stood for re-election the second time in 1992, he was opposed by Fredrik Reinfeldt, who is the former leader of the Moderate Party. The congress was preceded by considerable ideological divisions between Libertarians and Conservatives. All this erupted at the congress in Lycksele, which came to be known as The Battle of Lycksele. Kristersson, the Libertarian alternative, lost narrowly. On October 5, 2010 he became Minister for Social Security. He was predicted as a future leader of the party before his loss. It is said that his loss caused his withdrawal from front-line politics and he was subsequently known as part of \"Lost Generation\" of the Moderate Party. In 1991 Ulf Kristersson was elected to the Riksdag and served until 2000. He worked in the private sphere before being elected a Commissioner for Finance in Strängnäs in 2003. After the landslide for the centre-right Alliance in the Stockholm municipal election in 2006, Kristersson became vice mayor with responsible for social welfare and labour division. Kristersson was also asked by Fredrik Reinfeldt to lead the committee responsible for developing a new family policy for the party. He immediately caused controversy by suggesting that fathers must take a month of paternity leave for the family to receive all benefits. This was clearly in conflict with traditional Moderate Party policy, which has centred on individual choice.",

He was the only African-American mayor of that city, and his 20 years in office mark the longest tenure by any mayor in the city's history. His 1973 election made him the second African-American mayor of a major U.S. city. Bradley retired in 1993, after his approval ratings began dropping subsequent to the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. Bradley unsuccessfully ran for Governor of California in 1982 and 1986 and was defeated each time by the Republican George Deukmejian. The racial dynamics that appeared to underlie his narrow and unexpected loss in 1982 gave rise to the political term \"the Bradley effect.\" In 1985, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.",

He helped establish Reckitt & Sons, a manufacturer of household goods, as one of Kingston upon Hull’s foremost businesses. His career with the company spanned 61 years—from his initial employment as a confidential and shorthand clerk until his death, as chairman, in 1930. In the House of Commons, Ferens spoke to further the cause of Women's Rights. He supported women's suffrage at home, and repeatedly drew attention to the trafficking of women and girls in the colonies. But never a great orator, and by nature a retiring man, much of his work at Westminster was completed in the committee rooms, away from the limelight. He did not seek re-election after being unseated in acrimonious campaign in 1918. A devout Wesleyan Methodist, Ferens made numerous charitable donations throughout his life. His gifts to Hull include the Ferens Art Gallery and a donation of £250,000 for the establishment of University College (now the University of Hull). He is memorialized in the University's motto: Lampada Ferens. In other parts of the country he made substantial donations to schools, hospitals and charitable organisations.",

  "text" : "Tomihisa Taue (jap. 田上 富久, Taue Tomihisa; * 10. Dezember 1956 auf den Gotō-Inseln) ist ein japanischer Politiker und seit April 2007 Bürgermeister von Nagasaki. Taue studierte Jura an der Universität Kyūshū. Nach seiner Graduierung begann er in der Stadtverwaltung von Nagasaki zu arbeiten und war zuerst in den Bereichen Öffentlichkeitsarbeit und Tourismus tätig. Als der amtierende Bürgermeister Itchō Itō April 2007 nach einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung kurz vor den einheitlichen Regionalwahlen 2007 von dem Yakuza-Mitglied Tetsuya Shiroo niedergeschossen wurde und infolge seines hohen Blutverlustes starb, entschied sich Taue für das Amt des Bürgermeisters zu kandidieren. Er trat hierbei gegen Makoto Yokoo, den Schwiegersohn Itōs, an. Taue, der nun seine Kandidatur erst fünf Tage vor der Wahl einbrachte, versuchte Yokoos Kandidatur als Nepotismus und Patronage darzustellen. Viel Wähler wiederum empfanden das Festhalten an dem Wahltermin so kurz nach Itōs Tod für taktlos und so kam es dazu, dass einige Wähler Wahlzettel mit Itōs Namen beschrifteten oder protestwählten. Nach einem knappen Ergebnis und mehreren Nachzählungen, wurde Taue mit einem Vorsprung von 953 Stimmen zum Bürgermeister gewählt. Wie schon sein Vorgänger setzt sich auch Taue gegen Atomwaffen ein. Kurz nach seiner Wahl zum Bürgermeister kritisierte er Fumio Kyūma für dessen am 30. Juni 2007 in einer Rede in der Reitaku-Universität bekundeten Äußerungen zum Atombombenabwurf auf Nagasaki. Ebenso kritisierte er den liberaldemokratischen Politiker Taku Yamasaki für dessen Aussagen über nordkoreanische Atomwaffentests, in denen Yamasaki sie als nützlich zur Erkenntnis über die nordkoreanische Atomwaffenkapazität bezeichnet hatte. Yamasaki äußerte sich später dahingehend, das er genauso wie Taue ein Gegner von Atomwaffen ist.",

  "text" : "Athanasios Plevris oder Thanos Plevris (griechisch Αθανάσιος Πλεύρης; * 21. Mai 1977) ist ein griechischer Jurist und Politiker der liberal-konservativen Nea Dimokratia. Plevris ist der Sohn des Holocaustleugners und antisemitischen Vertreters der extremen Rechten Kostas Plevris. Athanasios Plevris hat sich zwar öffentlich von den politischen Ansichten seines Vaters distanziert, ihn aber als Rechtsanwalt gegen den Vorwurf der Volksverhetzung verteidigt und nach dessen Freispruch die „in Griechenland geltende Meinungsfreiheit“ gepriesen. Plevris studierte Rechtswissenschaften an der Universität Athen und wurde im Strafrecht promoviert. Er schloss ein Aufbaustudium in Medizinrecht an der  Universität Heidelberg an. Während seines Aufenthalts dort war er 2002 Vorsitzender des Verbands der griechischen und zypriotischen Studenten. Plevris wurde bei der Parlamentswahl 2007 für die Partei LAOS gewählt. Bei der Europawahl 2009 wurde er als einer von zwei LAOS-Abgeordneten in das Europäische Parlament gewählt: Diesem gehörte er als Mitglied der europakritischen Fraktion Europa der Freiheit und Demokratie (EFD) jedoch nur einige Monate an: Bei den vorgezogenen Wahlen am 4. Oktober 2009 wurde er wieder in das nationale griechische Parlament gewählt. Als Abgeordneter im griechischen Parlament setzte sich Plevris für ein Gesetzesprojekt ein, das den im Ausland lebenden Griechen das Wahlrecht zusprechen würde. In einer Anfrage an den Justizminister hat er seine Empörung gegen die unverblümte Erwähnung des Namens Mazedonien auf den Karten der Partei Ouranio Toxo (Regenbogen, Partei der slawo-mazedonischen Minderheit) und Helsinki Watch ausgedrückt. Seine Frage, ob diese Organisationen sich nicht strafbar gemacht hätten, wurde von den Medien in Mazedonien empört als Forderung der Todesstrafe für die Mitglieder der Partei Regenbogen fehlinterpretiert. Die These der Existenz einer als mazedonisch zu bezeichnenden Sprache wird von Plevris als völlig inakzeptabel betrachtet. Er selbst nennt die in Mazedonien gesprochene Sprache „slawisch“ und stellt die Frage, warum der Staat „Organisationen finanziert, die der pro-skopianischen Propaganda dienen“. Im Mai 2012 wechselte Plevris zur Nea Dimokratia um den pro-europäischen Kurs Griechenlands zu unterstützen. Nach der Berufung von Dimitris Avramopoulos zum EU-Kommissar, rückte Plevris im November 2014 als Abgeordneter für die Nea Dimokratia im griechischen Parlament nach.",

Learmonth was the son of Thomas Learmonth, a well-known settler in Tasmania, and was born in 1818. Having been attracted to the new settlement at Port Phillip, he started with a pioneering party from the shores of Corio Bay, in August 1837, to explore the unknown country to the north-west, directing their course, in the first instance, to Mount Buninyong, near to which, in conjunction with his brother, Somerville Livingstone Learmonth, Mr. T. L. Learmonth subsequently entered on pastoral pursuits on the fine country the party then discovered farther to the north-west. In the following year the two brothers and some friends explored the course of the Loddon, and reached a prominent peak, which they afterwards called Ercildoune, from an old keep on the Scottish border associated with their ancestral history. Here the brothers established a second station. After many years of prosperity the Messrs. Learmonth disposed of their Buninyong property, and subsequently sold the famous Ercildoune estate to Sir Samuel Wilson. Mr. Learmonth was for some time a member of the Upper House in Victoria, and finally left for England in 1868. Mr. Learmonth, later lived at Park Hall, Polmont, N.B., and was a J. P. for Stirlingshire, married, firstly, in 1857, Louisa, daughter of Major-General Sir Thomas Valiant, who died in 1878; and, secondly, in 1879, Jane Florence Harriett, daughter of Lestock Reid, of the Bombay Civil Service.

Prior to that, he had been president of the Beaverton Education Association. He also was a teacher of history and government at Sunset High School, north of Beaverton. He continued teaching when the Legislature was not in session. In 1975, Governor Robert W. Straub appointed Marsh to a two-year term on the Governor's Committee on Aging. Tom Marsh was reelected to the House in 1976, but in 1978 decided not to run for a third term. He was succeeded by Nancy Ryles. The House district represented by Marsh was numbered District 5 at the time (and since 1971), and remained so under Ryles, but became District 7 in 1982, as a result of a reapportionment plan passed by the Oregon Legislature in 1981, based on data from the 1980 U.S. Census.

  "text" : "Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ruhollah Mūsavi Khomeini (Persian: روح‌الله خمینی‎‎, [ruːholˈlɑːhe χomeiˈniː] , 24 September 1902 – 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader, revolutionary and politician. He was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei. Khomeini was a marja (\"source of emulation\") in Twelver Shia Islam, a Mujtahid or faqih (an expert in Islamic law) and author of more than 40 books, but he is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the theory of velayat-e faqih, the \"Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (clerical authority)\", to include theocratic political rule by Islamic jurists. This principle (though not known to the wider public before the revolution), was appended to the new Iranian constitution after being put to a referendum. Khomeini called democracy the equivalent of prostitution. He was named Man of the Year in 1979 by American news magazine TIME for his international influence, and has been described as the \"virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture\" where he remains a controversial figure. In 1982, Khomeini survived one military coup attempt. Khomeini was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis, his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie, and for referring to the United States as the \"Great Satan\". Khomeini has been criticized for these acts and for human rights violations of Iranians (including his ordering of execution of thousands of political prisoners), and the pursuit of victory in the Iran–Iraq War that ultimately proved futile. He has also been lauded as a \"charismatic leader of immense popularity\", a \"champion of Islamic revival\" by Shia scholars, who attempted to establish good relations between Sunnis and Shias, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini held the title of Grand Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. He is generally referred to as Ayatollah Khomeini by others. In Iran, his gold-domed tomb in Tehrān's Behesht-e Zahrāʾ cemetery has become a shrine for his supporters, and he is legally considered \"inviolable\", with Iranians regularly punished for insulting him.",

  "text" : "Richard Joseph Daley (May 15, 1902 – December 20, 1976) was an American politician who served as the Mayor of Chicago for a total of 21 years (1955–1976) and chairman of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee for 23 years, holding both positions until his death in office in 1976. Daley was Chicago's third consecutive mayor from the working-class, heavily Irish American Bridgeport neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, where he lived his entire life. Daley is remembered for doing much to avoid the declines that some other \"rust belt\" cities like Cleveland, Buffalo and Detroit experienced during the same period. He had a strong base of support in Chicago's Irish Catholic community, and he was treated by national politicians such as Lyndon B. Johnson as a pre-eminent Irish American, with special connections to the Kennedy family. Daley played a major role in the history of the Democratic Party, especially with his support of John F. Kennedy in 1960 and of Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Daley is the father of Richard M. Daley, also a former mayor of Chicago, William M. Daley, a former United States Secretary of Commerce, and John P. Daley, a member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. While many members of Daley's administration were charged with corruption and convicted, Daley was never charged with corruption.",

He saw the aggressive Germanization of Polish territories controlled by the German Empire as the major threat to Polish culture and therefore advocated a degree of accommodation with another power that had partitioned Poland, the Russian Empire. He favored the re-establishment of Polish independence by nonviolent means, and supported policies favorable to the Polish middle class. During World War I, in Paris, through his Polish National Committee he was a prominent spokesman, to the Allies, for Polish aspirations. He was a principal figure instrumental in the postwar restoration of Poland's independent existence. Dmowski never wielded official political power, except for a brief period in 1923 as minister of foreign affairs. Nevertheless, he was one of the most influential Polish ideologues and politicians of his time. A controversial personality all his life and since, Dmowski believed that only a Polish-speaking andRoman Catholic could be a good Pole; his thinking marginalized other minorities, and he was vocally anti-semitic. In 1926 he attempted to emulate Italian fascism. He remains the prototype of Polish right-wing nationalism and has been called \"the father of Polish nationalism.\" Throughout most of his life, he was the chief opponent of the Polish military and political leader Józef Piłsudski and of the latter's vision of Poland as a multinational federation.",

  "text" : "Rob Fleming is a Canadian politician who represents the riding of Victoria-Swan Lake in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Fleming was elected the British Columbia New Democratic Party Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the district of Victoria-Hillside in the 2005 British Columbia general election, defeating incumbent British Columbia Liberal Party MLA Sheila Orr. He was re-elected on May 12, 2009 in the renamed constituency of Victoria-Swan Lake. In the 38th Parliament Fleming was the New Democrat critic for Advanced Education, sat on the Select Standing Committee on Education, and introduced two education-related private member bills: the Private Post-Secondary Accountability and Student Protection Act, 2007 and the Restoring Credibility to Universities Act, 2008. He was also assigned to the Select Standing Committee on Public Accounts and introduced the Payday Lending Act, 2006 which sought to regulate the conditions of payday loans and led to the government adopting the Business Practices and Consumer Protection (Payday Loans) Amendment Act a year later. In the 39th Parliament Fleming became the NDP's environment critic. He introduced the Cosmetic Pesticide and Carcinogen Control Act and sat on the subsequent Special Committee on Cosmetic Pesticides which investigated potential bans or regulations on pesticides used for cosmetic purposes. Fleming also introduced the Species at Risk Protection Act, after the government delayed a promise to review its species-at-risk legislation, and the Sustainable Development Indicators and Reporting Act, 2011 which sought to create a Sustainable Development Board to report on provincial sustainability-related indicators. Fleming sat on the Select Standing Committee on Legislative Initiatives which considered the petition seeking the repeal of the Harmonized Sales Tax.",

He was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election, and was re-elected to his council seat twice. His political career, particularly his mayoralty, saw a number of personal and work-related controversies and legal proceedings. In 2013, he became embroiled in a substance abuse scandal, which was widely reported in the national and international media. Following his admission, Ford refused to resign, but City Council handed over certain mayoral powers and office staff to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly for the remainder of Ford's term. Despite the scandal, Ford initially contested the next mayoral election, scheduled for October 2014, but after being hospitalized and diagnosed with an abdominal tumour in September 2014, Ford withdrew from the mayoral race and registered instead to run for his old city council seat. John Tory succeeded him as mayor on December 1, 2014, while Ford regained his former seat. Ford received treatment for the cancer, and was able to return to City Hall for a while, but died in March 2016 after chemotherapy was ineffective.",

Rybarski studied at the Law School of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków from 1906 to 1911. During the studies, he was a member of the secret Association of the Polish Youth \"Zet\". In 1910 he joined the National League, a secret Polish right-wing organization. Rybarski was professor at the Jagiellonian University from 1917 until 1920, from 1921 until 1923 at the Warsaw University of Technology and from 1924 at the Warsaw University. In 1919 he took part in the Paris Peace Conference as an economic expert of the Polish delegation. Rybarski was one of the leading persons in the Camp of Great Poland. In 1928 he co-founded the National Party. From 1928 until 1935 he was a member of the Sejm, where he was one of the leading figures of the party. As one of the foremost persons in the \"old faction\" of the National Democracy, Rybarski advocated the parliamentary democracy. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Rybarski worked in the Polish underground, being in the Political Council of the Service for Poland's Victory. He held several other positions in the Polish underground state during World War II. On 17 May 1941 he was arrested by Nazi German authorities and incarcerated in the Pawiak prison. He was later transferred to the Nazi German Auschwitz concentration camp and eventually executed there for organizing the resistance movement in the camp. In terms of economic thought, Rybarski was a fierce supporter of a laissez-faire to the economy. He advocated for stability of property rights and economic institutions, and low taxes. Compulsory social security, monopolies and government granted concessions to businesses were not desirable, according to his view.",

Tan Sri Rafidah binti Aziz (born 4 November 1943) is a Malaysian politician who was Member of Parliament for the Kuala Kangsar constituency from 1986 to 2013. Born in Kuala Kangsar, Perak, Rafidah was Minister of International Trade and Industry from 1987 to 2008. As minister, she was the chairman of MATRADE beginning in 1991. Rafidah was the head of United Malays National Organisation's Woman Wing (Wanita UMNO in Malay) from 1999 to 2009, before losing out in the 2009 UMNO General Assembly election to Shahrizat Abdul Jalil after seeking re-election for another term. In 2006, Rafidah was accused of corruption related to the issuance of Approved Permits (AP) for importing foreign vehicles by former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad in his series of criticisms against the Government of Malaysia. Mahathir had also criticised then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's handling of the Approved Permits (AP) issue, expressing his surprise that Rafidah was still retained as a Cabinet member although two people on the list of persons issued with highest number of APs were linked to her. In March 2008, following the general election held in that month, Rafidah was dropped from cabinet, despite winning her parliamentary seat when other ministers had lost theirs. After thirty two years in government service, and twenty years as a minister, she described herself as being \"blessed and content.\" When asked if she was saddened, she said that she wished Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had told her earlier on not to contest the election. Rafidah was an active member in the Malaysian political scene, having previously been appointed as a Member of the Malaysian Parliament. She was appointed as Senator in 1974 and resigned to contest in the General Elections in 1978. She served as Member of Parliament in the Selayang Constituency (from 1978 to 1982) and Kuala Kangsar Constituency (from 1982 to 2013). She served in the UMNO Supreme Council for 38 years since winning a seat in the council in 1975. She is Malaysia's longest-serving Minister of International Trade and Industry, having served in that capacity from 1987 to 2008. Previously, she also hold the portfolio of Minister of Public Enterprises from 1980 to 1987 and Deputy Minister of Finance from 1977 to 1980. In 1976, she was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Public Enterprises. Rafidah also had experience lecturing at the faculty of Economics and Administration at the University of Malaya. She started her career as a tutor and lecturer in the Faculty of Economics, University of Malaya from 1966 to 1976. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1966 and a Masters degree in Economics in 1970, both from the same university. Rafidah currently serves as the Non-Executive Independent Chairman and Director of AirAsia X since March 3, 2011. She is also the Chairman of Supermax Corporation Berhad since June 16, 2015.",

He resigned effective May 2005 to become President and CEO of the North Dakota Bankers Association and Cory Fong was appointed to serve until an election in 2006 (where Fong was elected). In responding to Clayburgh's resignation, Governor John Hoeven described him as \"a dedicated servant of North Dakota for the past twenty years\" who had served with \"integrity and distinction\" and stated that he would be missed. Clayburgh was well-favored in his 2002 campaign for North Dakota's at-large congressional district against incumbent Democrat Earl Pomeroy, and ran an aggressive campaign including a visit from then-Vice President Dick Cheney in Fargo, North Dakota. He raised over US$1 million for the campaign. Despite the efforts, Pomeroy edged out Clayburgh and won re-election, with 52% of the vote.",

Pannu was born in Punjab, India completing an undergraduate degree before immigrating to Canada in 1962. He settled in Whitecourt, Alberta, where he worked as a high school teacher until 1964. In 1964 he moved to Edmonton to work on a graduate program, completing a Ph.D. in sociology in 1973. He taught at York University for one year (1968–69) before returning to the University of Alberta, where he taught for 27 years until his retirement in 1996. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Alberta. He entered provincial politics in 1997 when he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the riding of Edmonton-Strathcona. Raj became leader in February 2000 after the previous leader, Pam Barrett, retired from politics. Pannu ran a high-profile campaign in the 2001 Alberta election. T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Raj Against the Machine\", as well as a reputation as a \"likeable and honest politician\" contributed to his popularity and made him a leader well respected by supporters and non-supporters alike. He announced on July 13, 2004 that he was resigning as party leader. Fellow MLA Brian Mason, the deputy leader, became interim leader. Mason was formally elected leader in a leadership convention held on September 18. However, he sought re-election as an MLA in the 26th Alberta general election, and was re-elected by a wide margin. On June 14, 2006, he announced his retirement from Alberta politics at the dissolution of the legislature, which took place in February 2008.",

Robert William Carrall pochodził z jednej z najszacowniejszych rodzin kanadyjskich, lojalistycznych wychodźców z Nowej Anglii. Urodził się w Woodstock w Górnej Kanadzie. W 1859 ukończył uniwersytet uzyskując doktorat z medycyny. W czasie wojny secesyjnej w USA pracował jako kontraktowy chirurg w armii Unii. Po zakończeniu wojny pozostał w USA przyjmując posadę najpierw w szpitalu w Waszyngtonie, a następnie w Nowym Orleanie. W 1865 opuścił Stanu Zjednoczone i osiedlił się na Wyspa Vancouver gdzie w Nanaimo rozpoczął prywatna praktykę lekarską. Carrall został także przedsiębiorcą i finansistą. Ryzykowne, lecz szczęśliwe inwestycje w górnictwie przyniosły mu fortunę, która stała się przepustką do wyższych sfer kolonii. Corrall reprezentował stanowisko zdecydowanie prokanadyjskie i prokonfederacyjne. Jego wieloletni pobyt w USA przekonał go, że zagospodarowanie pluskowi kanadyjskich jest celowe i możliwe. Wierzył też, że Kanada jest w stanie konkurować ze swym sąsiadem i ściągnąć na swe tereny większość emigrantów opuszczających Europę. W 1868 jako konfederata, zdobył swój pierwszy mandat do legislatury kolonialnej. Brał aktywny udział w debacie konfederacyjnej. W styczniu 1870 Anthony Musgrave powołał go do rady rządowej kolonii, a w kwietniu do trzyosobowej delegacji na negocjacje zjednoczeniowe z rządem w Kanadzie. W czasie negocjacji był jedynym z trójki, który miął okazje spotkać się osobiście z chorującym pierwszym premierem Kanady Johnem Macdonaldem. Po dołączeniu Kolumbii Brytyjskiej do Kanady jako szóstej prowincji zamieszkał w niej jakiś czas. W 1872 został powołany do Senatu, jako przedstawiciel swej prowincji. W Senacie wsławił się propozycją by dzień 1 lipca, rocznicę zawiązania Konfederacji Kanady, a także przystąpienia do niej Kolumbii Brytyjskiej w pięć lat później, obchodzić jako święto państwowe – Canada Day – Dzień Kanady. Carrall zmarł przedwcześnie w wieku 40 lat, na powikłania w związku z wrzodem żołądka.",

  "text" : "Ruy Barbosa de Oliveira (Salvador de Bahía, 5 de noviembre de 1849 — Petrópolis, 1 de marzo de 1923) fue un importante escritor, jurista y político brasileño. Fue diputado, senador, ministro de finanzas e impuestos y diplomático. Por su participación distinguida en la Conferencia de la Haya de 1907, se ganó el apodo de «Águila de La Haya». Se postuló sin éxito para la presidencia de Brasil en 1910 y nuevamente en 1919. Ruy Barbosa dio su primer discurso público para la abolición de la esclavitud cuando tenía 19 años. Para el resto de su vida continuó una defensa intransigente de las libertades civiles. La Esclavitud en Brasil fue finalmente abolida por la Lei Áurea (Ley Dorada) en 1888. Parte del legado de Barbosa a la historia es su autorización, como ministro de finanzas en 1890, de la destrucción de la mayoría de los archivos gubernamentales relacionados con la esclavitud. Las ideas liberales de Barbosa fueron influyentes en el proyecto de la primera constitución republicana (1891). Él fue un partidario del dinero fiat, como oposición del patrón oro, en Brasil. Durante su mandato como ministro de finanzas, implementó reformas de gran alcance en el régimen financiero de Brasil, instituyendo una política monetaria vigorosamente expansionista. El resultado fue caos e inestabilidad: el llamado experimento fiat fue un fracaso totál. Un contragolpe ortodoxo siguió bajo el programa de Murtinho luego en la década. Uno de sus pensamientos más recordados: «De tanto ver triunfar las insignificancias, de tanto ver prosperar la deshonra, de tanto ver crecer la injusticia, de tanto ver agigantarse los poderes en las manos de los malos, el hombre llega a desanimarse de la virtud, a reírse de la honra, a tener vergüenza de ser honesto...»",

  "text" : "Donald Howard Yarborough (December 15, 1925 - September 23, 2009), was a liberal Democratic politician who was reportedly the first Southern politician to endorse the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yarborough, an attorney in Houston, Texas, ran for governor of Texas in 1962, 1964, and 1968. In 1962, he came close to winning the primary runoff election against John B. Connally, Jr., having polled 49 percent of the ballots. Other intraparty rivals, considered conservatives, included the state attorney general, Will Wilson, highway commissioner Marshall Formby, and General Edwin A. Walker, who made anticommunism the centerpiece of his race. The Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jack Cox, an oil equipment executive from Houston, was also a strong conservative and a former Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives. Although Yarborough never became governor, his campaigns contributed strongly to the reform of the Texas Democratic Party, uniting, behind Yarborough's candidacy, traditional New Deal loyalists, organized labor, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and reform-seeking liberals, thereby enabling this coalition to capture local constituencies in the Texas House and Senate and build organizations later drawn upon by Mark White and Ann Richards. Yarborough was born in New Orleans on December 15, 1925. His father was the president of a bank in New Orleans that went bust in the Great Depression, so Don was sent temporarily to spend part of his boyhood living with an aunt in Mississippi, where he helped out picking cotton in the fields of his family’s farm with the laborers. His father eventually got a job with the government and moved the family to Washington, D.C. His family also spent time during the years after the Depression living with relatives in Coral Gables, Florida. The family eventually moved together to Houston when he was 12. His mother, Inez Black Yarborough, served as head of the Women in Yellow volunteer corps at the Jefferson Davis Hospital in Houston. Upon graduating from San Jacinto High School at 17, Yarborough enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, entered officer’s training school and became a Company Commander at the age of 19. He served one year in China at the close of World War II. After the war, Yarborough entered the University of Texas, where he belonged to Kappa Alpha fraternity, and worked part-time to supplement the money he received under the G.I. bill. He earned his law degree in 1950. Yarborough re-entered the Marine Corps to serve during the Korean War as a member of the Judge Advocate General’s Corp (JAG Corps). He then returned to Texas to found his own law firm and take part in civic affairs. In 1956, as president of the Houston Junior Chamber of Commerce, Yarborough won the national debating championship for the organization due to his passionate speaking skills. In 1960, Yarborough married his first wife, Katherine Edwards. In 1963, Yarborough was named by LIFE magazine as one of the 100 young Americans who were \"distinguished by their dedication to something larger than private success, because they had the courage to act against old problems, the boldness to try out new ideas, and a hard-bitten, undaunted hopefulness about man. In his first run for political office, Yarborough ran for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1960. In 1962, he ran for the first time for governor, and in a field of five Democratic candidates, he reached a run-off with John Connally and came within 28,000 votes of winning the nomination, a nationally-noted near-upset in a state long dominated by the conservative faction of the Democratic Party. He ran for governor again in 1964 and 1968. In political life he supported civil rights, economic justice, environmental protection, and women's equality, and he challenged the big business establishment that had long dominated Texas politics. After leaving politics, Yarborough promoted science as a means to ease suffering and cure aging, which he considered to be a disease that affected everyone. He worked as a lobbyist for Paraplegia Cure Research in Washington, D.C., where lived for many years on Capitol Hill and in Mclean, Va. He also played a role in the Council for a Livable World and was a founding member of biotech research companies. Yarborough died of Parkinson's disease on September 23, 2009. Yarborough was married three times, to Katherine Edwards Yarborough in 1960, to Gail Lind in 1978, and Houston realtor Charity O'Connell Yarborough in 1984.",

  "text" : "Dimitar Yanakiev Vlahov (Bulgarian: Димитър Янакиев Влахов) (1878 in Kukush, Ottoman Empire – 1953 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia) was a politician from the region of Macedonia and member of the left wing of the Macedonian-Adrianople revolutionary movement (also known as Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO)). As with many other IMRO members of the time, historians from the Republic of Macedonia consider him an ethnic Macedonian and in Bulgaria he is considered a Bulgarian. Vlahov declared himself until the early 1930s as a Bulgarian and afterwards as an Ethnic Macedonian. However such left Macedonian activists never managed to get rid of their strong Bulgarophile sentiments. He was born in Kukush (present-day Greece) and attended the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. After that he emigrated to the Kingdom of Bulgaria and graduated from secondary school in Belogradtchik. Vlachov also studied chemistry in Germany and Switzerland, where he took part in socialist circles. However, he graduated in these subjects from Sofia University. Here he enrolled in the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party. In 1903, Vlahov entered a military service in an officer's school in Sofia. Then he worked as a teacher in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki where he was active in IMRO. During this period, he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities. In 1905, Vlahov was released and went back to Bulgaria where he worked as a teacher in Kazanlak. In 1908, after the Young Turks revolution he began working in the Bulgarian secondary school in Thessaloniki again. In the next few years, Vlahov was politically active as a member of the Ottoman Parliament as a representative from the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). After the dissolution of the PFP in 1911, he became a member the Ottoman Socialist Party and in 1912 was elected again as a deputy in the Ottoman Parliament. After the Balkan Wars, Vlachov was a representative of the Kingdom of Bulgaria in high diplomatic and administrative positions in Odessa, Kiev, Pristina and Vienna. After World War I and the reestablishment of IMRO in 1920, Vlahov was elected as alternate member of its Central Committee, representing the left wing. At that time he was a Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Varna. Todor Alexandrov urged him to establish a contact between IMRO and Soviet Russia. As a messenger served Krastyo Rakovski, his best man and prominent figure of the Comintern. On behalf of IMRO, Vlahov departed in July 1923 to Moscow. So in 1924, IMRO entered negotiations in Vienna with the Comintern about collaboration between the communists and the Macedonian movement and the creation of a united Macedonian movement. Vlahov helped the subscription of the so-called May Manifesto about forming a Balkan Communist Federation and cooperation with the Soviet Union. After the subsequent rift between the organization and the Communists, the new leadership headed by Ivan Mihailov excluded him from the organization and he was sentenced to death. In 1925, he was one of the founders of the IMRO (United) in Vienna. He also became a member of Bulgarian Communist Party. During the late 1920s, he worked in France, Germany and Austria as a Comintern publicist. During this period he was chased by IMRO and against him were organized several failed assassination attempts. In 1932 a members of IMRO (United), put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation in a lecture in Moscow. The question was also studied in the highest institutions of the Comintern and in the autumn of 1933, Dimitar Vlahov arrived in Moscow and took part in a number of meetings. So on January 11, 1934, the Political Secretariat of the Comintern adopted a special Resolution on the Macedonian Question. From 1936 to 1944, Vlahov lived in the Soviet Union and in 1944 he went to the new Yugoslavia with Socialist Republic of Macedonia, where he worked in high state and political positions. In 1948 on a meeting of the Central committee of the Macedonian Communist Party he claimed that the decision by the IMRO (United) from 1932 on the formation of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was a political mistake. Later, he was gradually pushed out of his power positions from the pro-Yugoslav circle around Lazar Kolishevski. Vlahov died in Belgrade in 1953.",

He became involved in a land dispute involving the authority of the laws from the Provisional Government with Josiah Lamberson Parrish. Lownsdale would defend the matter in court in a case that would make its way through the Oregon Supreme Court and to the United States Supreme Court in Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858).

Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \"Old Uncle Dennis\" or \"Father Pennington,\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens.",

Im Mai 1968 wurde er prominenter Sprecher der Studenten in Paris. Nach seiner Ausweisung aus Frankreich war er im Sozialistischen Deutschen Studentenbund (SDS) und der APO aktiv. In den 1970er Jahren gehörte er zur Sponti-Szene in Frankfurt am Main und gab das Stadtmagazin Pflasterstrand heraus. Ab 1978 engagierte er sich für die damals entstehende Partei der Grünen und entwickelte sich dort mit Joschka Fischer zu einem Vertreter des „Realo“-Flügels. 1989 bis 1997 war er der erste Dezernent des neu eingerichteten Amts für multi-kulturelle Angelegenheiten in Frankfurt am Main. Von 1994 bis 2014 war er Mitglied im Europäischen Parlament. Ab 2002 war er dort Co-Vorsitzender der Fraktion der Grünen / Europäische Freie Allianz. Er kandidierte abwechselnd für die deutschen Grünen und die französischen Les Verts bzw. Europe Écologie-Les Verts. Zur Europawahl 2014 zog sich Cohn-Bendit aus der aktiven Politik zurück. Er begründete dies mit der gesundheitlichen Belastung, werde aber weiterhin „demonstrieren gehen“. Cohn-Bendit schrieb zahlreiche politische Aufsätze und Bücher und moderiert verschiedene Fernsehsendungen. Er wohnt in Frankfurt am Main, ist seit 1997 mit seiner langjährigen Partnerin Ingrid Apel verheiratet. Er hat mit ihr einen Sohn und zog Ingrids Sohn Niko Apel mit auf.",

He subsequently became the Mayor of Ashburton in 1998. In 2010, Hope was elected unopposed to Fleet Town Council in Hampshire.

  "text" : "Herbert Arthur Sinnott (January 7, 1871 – after 1923) was a Canadian educator, lawyer and municipal politician who served as the 18th mayor of Calgary, Alberta from 1913 to 1915. Sinnott was born in Kings County, New Brunswick on January 7, 1871 to David S., a farmer, and Frances (née Taylor) Sinnott. After attending schools in Sussex, New Brunswick, Sinnott graduated from Mount Allison University with a Bachelor of Arts and started his teaching career in Gagetown as principal of a grammar school. He later taught high school in Moncton, New Brunswick before moving west to Alberta in 1900. In 1903, he became a high school principal in Calgary, the first ever to the city. He began a career in law in 1908, articling under Thomas M. Tweedie. In 1911, he was called to the bar. Around this time, Sinnott also owned and rented out various properties in the city of Calgary as well as Lethbridge. He also served on the Calgary School Board as trustee in 1912 and 1920–22 along with chairman from 1908–11 and 1918–19. Sinnott was elected as Mayor of Calgary and served in this position from January 2, 1913 to January 2, 1915. During his time in office, oil was discovered within the city of Calgary, and it was said that the \"[whole city] quickly became oil conscious\". In January 1923, Sinnott pleaded guilty in a court to \"misappropriating clients' trust funds\" during his work as a lawyer in Calgary. During his trial, Sinnott admitted his guilt and was sentenced to seven years to be served in a Prince Albert, Saskatchewan jail. The magistrate had expressed that \"the more grievous\" crime that of the betrayal of trust of Sinnott to his clients, and that it was unfortunate that such a citizen of high of esteem, had admitted to committing the crimes. The magistrate also expressed that the punishment was decided to set a precedent and to \"deter others from doing the same thing\", along with restating that though it was hard to see \"a citizen of Mr. Sinnott's calibre\" take the sentence, it was a necessary justice. It is not known where Sinnott went after presumably leaving prison, although there have been rumours that he may have moved to Australia shortly thereafter. He married Margaret Horne, a graduate nurse and daughter of a sea captain, in 1901 and had one child with her, Margaret. His wife died in 1906. A conservative in politics, during his time in Calgary, Sinnott was a member of the Ancient Order of Foresters in Calgary as well as the Methodist church. Sinnott was widely regarded for his work in the educational field, with a 1912 biography beginning with \"The educational annals of the Northwest present few names which shine with a brighter luster of good deeds done than the one which forms [this paragraph]\".",

Born in Sydney, the son of a convict sent to Australia for highway robbery, Wills is notable as being involved in several events in Australian history. He was also the father of Tom Wills, Australia's first great cricketer and inventor of Australian rules football. The Argus newspaper of 12 March 1921 records the Horatio Wills family being at Burra Burra Gundagai till around 1840. Thomas Wills, Horatio's son, was born in 1836 near Gundagai, New South Wales. Wills was one of the first settlers of the Ararat district in western Victoria, Australia, at a 125,000-acre (510 km2) property named Lexington near Moyston. Wills intended to build a house on the property which was finally completed in 1845. While at Lexington he is credited as having named nearby Mount Ararat. He hired aborigines as station hands and harvesters on his property. In 1852, Wills sold Lexington and moved to Belle Vue in Geelong. Wills was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for Grant on 10 January 1855; and was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for South Grant in November 1856, a position he held until August 1859. In 1861, Horatio moved north to Queensland, at Cullin-La-Ringo in the Nogoa region near Rockhampton. Just three weeks later, Horatio was murdered by aborigines, along with 18 others at the Cullin-la-ringo massacre, 17 October 1861; the biggest massacre of whites by Aboriginal people in Australian history.",

  "text" : "Herbert Charles Wilson (December 7, 1859 – December 17, 1909) was a Canadian politician and physician. He served as mayor of the Town of Edmonton and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. Wilson was born in 1859 in what would become the province of Ontario. The son of a manufacturer, Wilson's family had extensive business interests in the area of Picton, Ontario. Wilson studied medicine and moved to Edmonton in 1882, one of the first physicians to settle there. He was appointed to official medical positions and, for several years, owned a drugstore in town. He served as a consultant to First Nations reserves near Edmonton and also became a director of many local corporations. He was elected to the Territorial council in 1885, and soon became its speaker. During his speakership, he helped to change the council's rules and procedures. He left territorial politics after six years, citing health reasons. He maintained a medical practice in town for many years, and went to considerable efforts to keep up with the latest practices. Wilson interested himself in civic activities in Edmonton, and eventually ran for mayor, winning election in 1895. He left office after less than two years in a dispute over town funds. He attempted a comeback in 1904, but was defeated in a run for the town council. He married in 1886, and had a son and two daughters. He died in 1909; an industrial park in the city is named for him.",

  "text" : "Isiah \"Ike\" Leggett (born July 25, 1944) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Maryland, currently serving as the executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Deweyville, Texas, Leggett attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, after serving in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Army, earned a law degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1986, he became the first African-American elected to the county council in Montgomery County, Maryland and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected County Executive of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, Leggett has worked to put the County’s fiscal house in order while strengthening critical County services in education and public safety, and helping the most vulnerable. In the four years before Leggett took office, County spending grew by over 40 percent. In his first five years in office, Montgomery County's spending was held to zero percent. Responding to the worldwide recession that hit in 2008, Leggett closed budget gaps of over $2.6 billion, eliminating 10 percent of County government positions, while imposing furloughs (including himself), wage freezes, and changes in retirement and health benefits to save the County money. At the same time, Leggett put tens of millions of dollars into building and preserving thousands of units of affordable housing in the County, establishing a CountyStat office to ensure “real time” performance of County services, and set up a multi-agency Positive Youth Development Initiative to ensure positive programs for at-risk youth. Leggett worked to strengthen Montgomery County's biotechnology and life sciences sectors and also established the \"311\" Customer Service as a single point of entry via phone and the internet for residents seeking County services. During Leggett's first eight years, serious crime went down in the County by 24 percent and the Fire and Rescue Service's response times to Montgomery County's fires improved dramatically. Leggett was reelected to a second term in 2010 and to a third four-year term in 2014.",

  "text" : "Olav Meisdalshagen (17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party best known for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian Minister of Agriculture from January 1955 to May 1956. He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time, being elected for the first time in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death, except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament, and shortly after a parliamentary speech. A jurist by profession, Meisdalshagen came from a humble family background, growing up at a former crofter's farm in rural Nord-Aurdal, and losing his father in the 1920s. After studying he moved back to Nord-Aurdal, worked as an attorney and built the Labour Party organization in the region. The background formed him in that his main political goal was to improve the economy of dwellers in rural farming districts. He was a proponent of economic regulation, which marked his period as Minister of Finance. However, his period was also marked by the dominance of Erik Brofoss and the Ministry of Trade in deciding the country's overall financial policy. When Trygve Bratteli succeeded Meisdalshagen as Minister of Finance, the ministry regained its dominance, but also set out on a gradual deregulation. This, in addition to Meisdalshagen's discontent with increased spendings on defence, made him an oppositional figure within the Labour Party. He did return briefly to cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, and also cooperated with the government through the position as chairman of Norges Kooperative Landsforening, a national association of consumer co-operatives. However his oppositional tendencies grew stronger in his later life. He was a part of the \"Easter Uprising\" in 1958, and in 1958 and 1959 there were rumours of Meisdalshagen worked behind the scene to facilitate a change of personnel—and policy—in the Labour Party. His death came in this period.",

  "text" : "Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (/ˈsʌlə/; c. 138 BC – 78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro. In Plutarch's Parallel Lives Sulla is paired with the Spartan general and strategist Lysander. Sulla's dictatorship came during a high point in the struggle between optimates and populares, the former seeking to maintain the Senate's oligarchy, and the latter espousing populism. In a dispute over the eastern army command (initially awarded to Sulla by the Senate but reneged at Gaius Marius's intrigues) Sulla unconstitutionally marched his armies into Rome and defeated Marius in battle. After his second march on Rome, he revived the office of dictator which had been inactive since the Second Punic War over a century before, and used his powers to enact a series of reforms to the Roman Constitution, meant to restore the primacy of the Senate and limit tribune power. Sulla's ascension was also marked by political purges in proscriptions. After seeking election to and holding a second consulship, he retired to private life and died shortly after. Sulla's decision to seize power – ironically enabled by his rival's military reforms that bound the army's loyalty with the general rather than to Rome – permanently destabilized the Roman power structure. Later leaders like Julius Caesar would follow his precedent in attaining political power through force.",

According to commentator Stephen Vines, the Chinese central government appointed Szeto to the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee because they appreciated his political significance, even though they disliked his ideas. Aside from his political career, Szeto was also well known for his Chinese calligraphy skills. He was referred to as \"Uncle Wah\" (華叔) by Hong Kong people.",

Сергій Олександрович Охріменко (ur. 6 października?/18 października 1876 we wsi Palczyk (gubernia kijowska), zm. 31 marca 1939 w więzieniu w Jarosławlu) – ukraiński dziennikarz, historyk literatury i krytyk literacki, aktywista polityczny, urzędnik i członek akademii naukowych. Wiceprezes Wszechukraińskiej Akademii Nauk (WUAN) (1921-28), członek rzeczywisty Towarzystwa Naukowego im. Szewczenki we Lwowie. Urodził się w wiosce Palczyk pod Katerynopolem w guberni kijowskiej w Imperium Rosyjskiego. Pochodził z rodziny prawosławnego duchownego. W latach 1891-1896 studiował w Kijowskim Seminarium Teologicznym, po czym ukończył wydział prawa na Uniwersytecie Kijowskim. Jego związek z polityką rozpoczął się w trakcie studiów. Zapisał się wówczas do Ogólnoukraińskiej Bezpartyjnej Organizacji Demokratycznej. W roku 1904 współtworzył Ukraińską Partię Radykalną, która w roku 1905 z jego inicjatywy zjednoczyła się z Ukraińską Partią Demokratyczną, przekształcając się w Ukraińską Partię Demokratyczno-Radykalną. W roku 1905 stanął na czelę Ukraińskiego Związku Społecznego – Związku Chłopskiego. W roku 1908 współtworzył Towarzystwo Ukraińskich Postępowców. W tym okresie publikował swoje artykuły w licznych ukraińskich czasopismach, takich jak: Zorza, Prawda, Kijowska Przeszłość, Ukraina i innych. W latach 1895-1918 zajmował posadę prezesa wydawnictwa Vik. Był wielokrotnie aresztowany przez władze rosyjskie za wygłaszanie publicznych przemówień w obronie narodowej kultury i swobód politycznych w okresie przed rewolucją lutową i obaleniem caratu. W marcu 1917 roku wszedł w skład Ukraińskiej Centralnej Rady. W kwietniu 1917 roku, podczas Ukraińskiego Kongresu Narodowego, wybrano go na przewodniczącego Rady oraz członka Małej Rady. 15 czerwca 1917 roku objął stanowisko sekretarza generalnego spraw międzynarodowych w nowo utworzonym rządzie ukraińskim – Generalnym Sekretariacie Centralnej Rady. W dniu 17 lipca 1917 roku na tym stanowisku zastąpił go Ołeksandr Szulhyn z tego samego ugrupowania. Począwszy od września 1917 roku przewodniczył Ukraińskiej Partii Socjalistów-Federalistów. W okresie od kwietnia 1918 roku aż do roku 1920 nie piastował żadnych funkcji urzędniczych. Po zajęciu Kijowa przez Armię Czerwoną musiał się ukrywać przed Czeka. W 1921 roku na prośbę Ukraińskiej Akademii Nauk uzyskał amnestię. Od roku 1922 do roku 1928 był wiceprezesem Wszechukraińskiej Akademii Nauk, praktycznie kierującym jej bieżącą działalnością. W 1928 zwolniony ze wszystkich funkcji w Akademii, 21 lipca 1929 aresztowany przez OGPU. W marcu-kwietniu 1930 w Charkowie był głównym oskarżonym podczas publicznego procesu pokazowego tzw. Związku Wyzwolenia Ukrainy (mistyfikacja OGPU). Skazany na dziesięć lat więzienia, które odbywał początkowo w izolatorze we Włodzimierzu nad Klaźmą, później w Jarosławlu, gdzie zmarł.",

His family were well known for their piety, learning and influence throughout Kurdistan for years before him. After being educated at the Religious School of Amadiya, He followed his ancestors in following the Naqshbandi Sufi order. During his life he granted more than hundred religious scientific licenses for scholars from different parts of Iraq, Iran, and the Middle East in general, and sponsored the daily living and study costs of his students and followers. He also contributed to establishing many schools and mosques in Bamarni, Amadiya and in many different villages. The Sheikh was also accredited for opening the first school in the Bahdinan region and obliged all children to attend school. The idea of opening a school was not favored by the then ruling government, and decided they would not pay the salaries of the teachers. This caused the Sheikh to pay the teachers salaries with his own money.",

  "text" : "Marcus Licinius Crassus (/ˈkræsəs/; Latin: M·LICINIVS·P·F·P·N·CRASSVS; c. 115 BC – 53 BC) was a Roman general and politician who played a key role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Amassing an enormous fortune during his life, Crassus is considered the wealthiest man in Roman history. Crassus began his public career as a military commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his civil war. Following Sulla's assumption of the dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through real estate speculation. Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus, sharing the Consulship with his rival Pompey the Great. A political and financial patron of Julius Caesar, Crassus joined Caesar and Pompey in the unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate. Together the three men dominated the Roman political system. The alliance would not last indefinitely due to the ambitions, egos, and jealousies of the three men. While Caesar and Crassus were lifelong allies, Crassus and Pompey disliked each other and Pompey grew increasingly envious of Caesar's spectacular successes in the Gallic Wars. The alliance was re-stabilized at the Lucca Conference in 56 BC, after which Crassus and Pompey again served jointly as Consuls. Following his second Consulship, Crassus was appointed as the Governor of Roman Syria. Crassus used Syria as the launchpad for a military campaign against the Parthian Empire, Rome's long-time Eastern enemy. Crassus' campaign was a disastrous failure, resulting in his defeat and death at the Battle of Carrhae. Crassus' death permanently unraveled the alliance between Caesar and Pompey. Within four years of Crassus' death, Caesar would cross the Rubicon and begin a civil war against Pompey and the optimates.",

  "text" : "Marc Godbout (born June 8, 1951) is the former Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ottawa—Orléans riding. He was first elected in the 2004 Canadian federal election, representing the Liberal Party of Canada. Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Godbout has a Master's degree in education from the University of Ottawa. Before entering politics, he worked as a high school history teacher. He has been Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for elementary and secondary education in Ontario and Director General and Secretary Treasurer of the Conseil des écoles catholiques de langue française du Centre-Est de l’Ontario. He entered federal politics by running for the Liberal nomination against sitting Liberal MP Eugène Bellemare. Bellemare, who held the riding for several elections, was removed. After his defeat in the nomination, Bellemare retired from politics. Godbout succeeded in beating the Conservative candidate Walter Robinson in the general election of 2004, by a slim majority. He campaigned on bringing more federal government jobs to the east end of Ottawa. In the 2006 general election, Godbout ran on a platform of Liberal support for municipalities and infrastructure. After eighteen years of the riding being held by the Liberals, Godbout was defeated for re-election when the Conservative Party of Canada won the riding under Royal Galipeau in the federal election of January 23, 2006. Godbout, along with a number of former and present Ontario Liberal MPs endorsed party leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy. At the Liberal Party Convention in Montreal, Godbout supported Michael Ignatieff after Kennedy dropped off the ballot. At the final ballot, Ignatieff was defeated by Stéphane Dion. On April 29, 2007, Godbout was nominated to run in the 40th Canadian federal election in a re-match against Galipeau. In the 2008 Canadian federal election, Godbout lost for the second time in a row to Conservative incumbent Royal Galipeau, and this time by an increased majority. The re-election of Galipeau marks the first time a Conservative candidate has been re-elected in the Orléans riding since 1872. In July 2009, Godbout announced that he would not make another run at reclaiming the riding in the next federal election. He said the decision was a professional one, as he wanted to focus on his business, a consulting firm, operating out of the east end.",

  "text" : "Marguerite Alice \"Missy\" LeHand (September 13, 1898 – July 31, 1944) was private secretary to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) for 21 years. According to Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, during FDR's presidency, LeHand became \"the most celebrated private secretary in the country\". Born into a poor Irish-American family in New York, LeHand attended secretarial school, took a series of clerical jobs, and eventually began to work for the Democratic Party's New York office. There she came to the attention of FDR's wife Eleanor during his 1920 vice presidential candidacy and was hired as FDR's personal secretary. After FDR was partially paralyzed by polio, LeHand became his daily companion, to the extent of adopting his favorite hobbies, games, and drinks. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her unable to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Boston and died in 1944. The exact nature of LeHand's relationship with FDR is debated by historians. It is generally accepted that their relationship contained a romantic element, though scholars remain divided on whether the pair had a sexual relationship. LeHand was engaged to U.S. Ambassador William Bullitt in 1933, but never married, later asking a friend, \"How could anyone ever come up to FDR?\"",

  "text" : "Dato' Seri Mohamed Nazri bin Abdul Aziz (born 15 May 1954) is a Malaysian politician from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), and is as of 2008 a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of affairs. In June 2005 Nazri caused controversy when he shouted the phrase \"racist\" (or variants of it) 28 times in Parliament. A request by opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) lawmaker Fong Po Kuan for Nazri to take back his comments went unheeded. The incident occurred during a debate on the Malaysian Medical Council's derecognition of Crimea State Medical University (CSMU) medical degrees; most Malaysian students sent to study there were of Indian extraction. Nazri has since used the phrase \"bloody racist\" on Tun Dr. Mahathir because the latter supports a controversial government programme that allegedly indoctrinates racist sentiments in civil servants and public university students. Nazri was originally also the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of legal affairs and judicial reform. After the 2008 general election, which saw the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition's majority in Parliament significantly reduced, the then Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi reshuffled his Cabinet and gave Nazri's legal affairs portfolio to Zaid Ibrahim. He has also recently (2006) been called the hatchetman of Abdullah, then Prime Minister of Malaysia, by Former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, for defending Abdullah in Mahathir's ongoing criticisms against the government. In September 2010 he came out openly in the defence of Prime Minister Najib's 1Malaysia policy, saying that he is a Malaysian first and a Malay next. This is in complete opposition to that expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister, Muhyiddin bin Mohd. Yassin, who has time and again reiterated that he is Malay first and Malaysian second. He is an alumnus of Malay College Kuala Kangsar.",

She was only the second person to unseat a sitting Australian prime minister since Jack Holloway defeated Stanley Bruce in 1929; and the third person to unseat the leader of a major party, after Neville Newell defeated Charles Blunt, leader of the National Party, in 1990. At the 2010 Federal election she lost her seat to the Liberal Party candidate, John Alexander. Before entering politics, McKew was an award-winning broadcast journalist. She hosted a number of programmes on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television and radio, most recently Lateline and The 7.30 Report.",

Bei den Parlamentswahlen 1997 gewann das Wahlbündnis unter seiner Führung die Wahl mit 33,8 % und bildete eine Koalitionsregierung mit der Freiheitsunion (UW). Obwohl von den Koalitionspartnern und dem Staatspräsidenten unterstützt, lehnte Krzaklewski den Posten des Premierministers ab und wurde lediglich Fraktionsvorsitzender des AWS-Fraktion. Premierminister wurde Jerzy Buzek. Bei den Präsidentschaftswahlen im Jahr 2000 trat Krzaklewski als Kandidat für die AWS an, scheiterte jedoch mit nur 15,6 %. 2001 trat Krzaklewski als Vorsitzender der AWS zurück. 2002 legte er auch den Solidarność-Vorsitz nieder.",

  "text" : "Margaret Brent (c. 1601 – c. 1671), an English immigrant to the Colony of Maryland, settling in its new capitol, St. Mary's City, Maryland, she was the first woman in the English North American colonies to appear before a court of the common law. She was a significant founding settler in the early histories of the colonies of Maryland and Virginia. Lord Calvert, Governor of the Maryland Colony, appointed her as the executrix of his estate in 1647, at a time of political turmoil and risk to the future of the settlement. She helped ensure soldiers were paid and given food to keep their loyalty to the colony, thereby very likely having saved the colony from violent mutiny, although her actions were taken negatively by the absentee colonial proprietor in England, Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, and so ultimately she paid a great price for her efforts and was forced to leave the colony. With Anne Hutchinson, Brent ranks among the most prominent female figures in early Colonial American history. Hailed as a feminist by some in modern times in advancing rights of women under the laws, her insistent advocacy of her legal prerogatives as an unmarried gentlewoman of property, while notable in its exceptional energy, was consistent on paper with English law. However, in the rough, male dominated world of the colonies, her stance for her rights and her independence was unusual in actual practice and it would have been fairly uncommon back in England in that period.",

  "text" : "Lieutenant Colonel Sir Michael Frederick Bruxner KBE, DSO, JP (25 March 1882 – 28 March 1970) was an Australian politician and soldier, serving for many years as Leader of the Country Party and its predecessors. Born in Tabulum in Northern New South Wales, Bruxner was educated at The Armidale School and started studies at University of Sydney but later dropped out to take up employment as a grazier and station agent in Tenterfield. After serving in the Citizen Military Forces from 1911, Bruxner enlisted into the Australian Light Horse upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Serving with distinction in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Returning to Australia in 1919, Bruxner sold his business and joined the Progressive Party, being elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for Northern Tablelands at the 1920 election. Bruxner came to political prominence when he led the rural \"True Blues\" faction of the Progressive Party that went against their Leader's decision to form a coalition in Sir George Fuller's short-lived government in 1921. Bruxner emerged as the leader of the reduced Progressive Party, which consisted of the members of his faction, but they nevertheless joined with Fuller's Nationalists to form government in 1922. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement. Bruxner resigned the party leadership, now for the renamed Country Party, at the end of 1925. At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England. Bruxner was central in ensuring Alexander Mair became Premier after Stevens was defeated in the house in August 1939. The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party of Australia. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962 and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970.",

  "text" : "Michael \"Mickey\" Cafagna (July 26, 1943 - April 11, 2009) was the third elected mayor of the city of Poway, California, serving from 1998 until his death in 2009. Cafagna was born in Detroit, Michigan, the third son of Italian immigrants. He moved to Poway (then an unincorporated part of San Diego County) circa 1975; following a successful career as a real estate developer, he was appointed to the Poway City Council in 1992, eventually winning the mayoral election in November 1998. As Mayor, Cafagna represented Poway in the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), serving for a time as its chairman. His other contributions include the construction of Poway's city hall and of the South Poway Business Park on Scripps Poway Parkway, his efforts to fund much-needed improvements to freeways and transit systems, and his leadership during the Cedar and Witch Creek fires of 2003 and 2007, respectively. He was most known for his outgoing personality and his ability to make deals for the benefit of the city. His genial manner also aided him in public situations; Deputy Mayor Don Higginson recounted an incident at the 1998 World Series between the New York Yankees and the San Diego Padres where Cafagna - just before his election as Mayor - invited Higginson and about a hundred others to travel to New York for the first two games. During Game 1, the Poway contingent sat among the Yankee fans, who booed them and threw beer on them. While others got up and left, Cafagna remained and offered to buy the Yankee fans a beer. By the end of the game, they were applauding him; when the party returned for Game 2, the Yankee fans cheered him. Even his political opponents, such as Poway's first mayor Bob Emery, acknowledged that while they had been opposed to his philosophies at first (Cafagna was a real estate developer, while Emery advocated slow-growth policy), they began to see things from his point of view, just as he saw things from theirs, and they grew to respect his character and his genial attitude. Cafagna had in fact avoided doing his development business in Poway to avoid conflicts of interest, and as Mayor opposed helter-skelter sprawl throughout the region (often with the \"How much do we have to grow before we destroy the reasons we live here\" speech, as Emery termed it). In 2005, Cafagna was diagnosed with kidney cancer and underwent an operation to remove it. However, it returned nearly four years later, having spread to his lungs. His illness prevented him from conducting day-to-day city government, and as a result Deputy Mayor Higginson became acting mayor. Cafagna was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on March 5 from what was previously thought to be pneumonia, but later determined to be septic shock; he died there on April 11, at the age of 65. After services at St. Michael's Catholic Church, he was buried a week later at Dearborn Memorial Park in Poway. Cafagna was survived by his wife of 43 years, Sharon Green Cafagna, as well as their two children, Kevin and Stacy, and five grandchildren.",

His residence was located on the site now occupied by the Electric Tower. In 1826 he was elected to his first political position as a Trustee of the Village of Buffalo. He held this position again in 1827. In 1829 he campaigned unsuccessfully, for a seat on the New York State Assembly.

  "text" : "Mete Kingi Te Rangi Paetahi, né vers 1813 et mort à Putiki le 22 septembre 1883, est un homme politique néo-zélandais. Il est l'un des quatre premiers Maori à siéger à la Chambre des représentants. Membre de l’iwi (tribu) Te Ati Haunui-a-Paparangi dans la région de Wanganui, il s'implique dans les années 1850 dans les médiations pour ramener la paix dans cette région affectée par de violents conflits territoriaux inter-tribaux. Dans le même temps il participe à des réunions du mouvement Kingitanga, mais pour y exprimer son opposition au mouvement : le Kingitanga affirme son indépendance vis-à-vis des autorités coloniales, tandis que Mete Paetahi est partisan de la souveraineté britannique en Nouvelle-Zélande. Il s'oppose aussi au soulèvement de la secte Pai Marire dans les années 1860, et se joint aux forces maori pro-britanniques qui le combattent. Il prend part à la bataille de Moutoa le 14 mai 1864. Il fournit au gouvernement colonial d'importantes recommandations tactiques dans le conflit, et participe à la bataille d'Ohoutahi en février 1865, puis à l'expédition militaire des forces gouvernementales dans le Taranaki en janvier et février 1866. En 1868 se tiennent les premières élections pour des sièges réservés aux Maori à la Chambre des représentants. Seul candidat dans la circonscription couvrant l'ouest du pays, Paetahi est déclaré élu. Un mois après son entrée au Parlement en mai, les forces coloniales font à nouveau face à une résistance maori armée : l’iwi Ngati Ruanui, sous son chef Titokowaru, se soulève en réponse à des confiscations de terres. Mete Paetahi, s'exprimant au Parlement, incite le gouvernement à répondre avec fermeté, soulignant les exactions commises par les rebelles. La même année, il succède au statut de chef de plus haut rang des tribus du sud du Wanganui. Il perd son siège de député aux élections de 1871. Il ne participe dès lors plus à la vie politique coloniale, mais prend part dans les années 1870 à des réunions inter-tribales maori pour discuter de la représentation politique des Maori, et de l'attitude à adopter sur la question des terres. Il est généralement favorable à l'idée de vendre des terres aux colons, tant que les tribus en conservent suffisamment pour vivre. Il se consacre par ailleurs à l'élevage de moutons qu'il acquiert en 1877. Il meurt à l'âge d'environ 70 ans, et les autorités coloniales l'honorent de funérailles militaires, en reconnaissance de ses services durant les Guerres maories.",

At the time of its closure the waste facility was the third largest in North America near the heart of Vaughan, the fifth largest city in the Greater Toronto Area. The waste landfill site became the centre of a 14 year battle between the citizens of Vaughan and both the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, which owned and operated the site. Mr. Ferri co-founded Vaughan CARES, an activist group that became prominent in the fight to close the waste facility. As a community organizer Ferri also contributed to numerous cultural organizations and helped organize large events, as well as administering community recreational facilities in Toronto, Vaughan and other surrounding communities. In his roles as a York Region Separate School Board trustee, municipal and regional councillor and deputy mayor he undertook several community campaigns and frequently acted as a spokesperson for the school board, the City of Vaughan and for York Region. In October 2014 Ferri was elected to his fifth term as a councillor for the City of Vaughan and his third term as a councillor for the Region of York, Ontario.",

After the 1969 federal elections, West Germany's conservative alliance found itself out of power for the first time since the founding of the Federal Republic. At this time, Strauss became more identified with the regional politics of Bavaria. While he ran for the chancellorship as the candidate of the CDU/CSU in 1980, for the rest of his life Strauss never again held federal office. From 1978 until his death in 1988, he was the head of the Bavarian government. His last two decades were also marked by a fierce rivalry with CDU chairman Helmut Kohl.",

Hague has a widely known reputation for corruption and bossism and has been called \"the grandaddy of Jersey bosses.\" By the time he left office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the Plaza Hotel. His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million at the time of his death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income. His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his \"guests\" to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash. However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallinan, the drawers were a traditional feature of 19th century partners desks and that \"[t]he last thing [Hague] would need to do is take a bribe personally.\" As of September 2013, the desk was in storage awaiting restoration. During the height of his power Hague's political machine, known as \"the organization,\" was one of the most powerful in the United States controlling politics on local, county, and state levels.

  "text" : "Dr. Francisco Epigmenio Luna Kan (born December 3, 1925) is a Mexican politician. Francisco Luna Kan was governor of the state of Yucatán from 1976 to 1982. Born in Mérida, Yucatán, he was a practicing doctor of medicine then taught as a Professor of Medicine before first obtaining political office, at first being overseer of the state's rural medical system. Francisco Luna Kan was the first person of pure Maya ancestry to govern Yucatán since the Spanish conquest of Yucatán. (In the early 1920s, Felipe Carrillo Puerto, who was partly Maya, had been governor.) For centuries the political elite had been Criollos (Yucatecans of pure Spanish ancestry). It was widely said that party officials of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took the unusual step of selecting a person of Maya descent as their candidate in 1975 because the opposition National Action Party had been getting many votes in Yucatán, and PRI candidates had been getting a poor showing in the state's predominantly Maya towns and villages. It was said that PAN got the majority of votes in the previous governor's race, and the PRI managed to maintain control of the state only through fraud in counting votes. Shortly after his election Luna Kan was subjected to an unpleasant incident while taking a train to Mexico City for a governmental conference. Luna Kan was thrown off the train, as the railroad conductors thought it inconceivable that this short man of obvious Native American features was telling the truth when he claimed to be a state governor. After his term as governor Luna Kan resigned from the PRI and joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). He unsuccessfully ran as that party's candidate for mayor of Mérida in 1998. As of 2004 Francisco Luna Kan holds a seat in Mexico's Chamber of Deputies of Mexico as a PRD deputy for Yucatán.",

In 1768 he was accused of abduction and rape by Sarah Woodcock, a noted beauty who kept a milliner's shop at Tower Hill. The jury acquitted Calvert but he left England soon afterwards, and never recovered from the public scandal which surrounded the trial. Dogged by criticism and poor health, he contracted a fever and died in Naples at the age of 40.",

Como político, fue partidario de un modelo federalista para la Primera República Española, sabiendo conjugar las influencias de Proudhon para llevar a cabo la política del Estado con tendencias del socialismo democrático y del socialismo libertario. Contrario a la monarquía española en cualquiera de sus variantes y formas, participó activamente en la oposición a la misma, por lo que sufrió censura, cárcel y exilio. Después de la Revolución Gloriosa fue diputado en Cortes Generales, donde dirigió el Partido Federal, y ministro de la Gobernación con Estanislao Figueras. Tras la dimisión de este, las Cortes le eligieron Presidente, cargo desde el cual se enfrentó a la Tercera Guerra Carlista y la Revolución Cantonal, defendiendo el Proyecto de Constitución Federal de 1873. Se vio obligado a dimitir ante la imposibilidad de desarrollar su labor de gobierno tras el Cantón de Cartagena. Como intelectual se dedicó esencialmente a la Historia, la Filosofía y el Arte. Se le considera como uno de los intelectuales representativos del pensamiento más avanzado de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX. Escribió multitud de obras y fue redactor y director de varios periódicos. Tuvo contacto con las grandes figuras de la intelectualidad europea de la época, lo que le granjeó una enorme reputación en España y fuera de ella. Con una biografía intachable debida a su honradez, acompañada por una dedicación intensa a sus principios políticos, se ha convertido en un referente de la tradición democrática española.",

He came to California in 1876, and worked on a farm in Marysville. He came to Chico in 1878. He partnered with Charles Fetters and opened Fetters and Williams. In 1906, Williams bought out Mr. Fetters and continued the business under the same name. Williams was also interested in horticulture, and owned several orchards of almonds and prunes on his ranch near Lone Pine Avenue. He was the first person in Butte County to operate apiaries.

He was passed over as Prime Minister in 1923 in favour of Stanley Baldwin. His character polarised opinion amongst his contemporaries, \"sow[ing] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands\". He quarrelled endlessly and his arrogance and inflexibility made even more enemies.

Appointed to the Canadian Senate representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102. Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques. In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record. Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday. His daughter Henriette Dessaulles became a noted writer and journalist.",

He lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between Prince Charles and the Spanish House of Habsburg royal family. Rather than continue in politics, he resigned all of his political offices in 1625 except for his position on the Privy Council and declared his Catholicism publicly. He was created Baron Baltimore in the Irish peerage upon his resignation. Baltimore Manor was located in County Longford, Ireland. The name Baltimore is an Anglicisation of the Irish Baile an Tí Mhóir, which means \"town of the big house.\" Calvert took an interest in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, Sir George looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil, (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert, (1606–1647), was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.",

During his city council tenure, Schiff worked to ease ordinances prohibitive to small businesses, especially microbreweries, and strongly advocated against a publicly funded stadium for the Minnesota Vikings. In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for Mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 election but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June.

  "text" : "ゲンナジー・エドゥアルドヴィチ・ブルブリス（русский: Геннадий Эдуардович Бурбулис, ラテン文字転写: Gennadii Eduardovich Burbulis, 1945年8月4日 - ）は、ロシアの政治家。エリツィン時代前期の国務長官。同郷のエリツィンの側近として権勢を振るい「灰色の枢機卿」の異名を取った。ドイツ語に堪能である。 1945年8月4日、ソビエト連邦ロシア連邦共和国のスヴェルドロフスク州ペルヴォウラリスク市生まれ。ロシア人であるが、「ブルブリス」というリトアニア系の苗字は、第一次世界大戦の時に祖父がリトアニアからウラルに移住したことに由来するという。 1962年から地元のペルヴォウラリスク市で電気工として働き、兵役を終えた後、スヴェルドロフスク市（現在のエカテリンブルク市）に移り、工場に勤務する。その後、ウラル大学哲学部に入学し、1974年に同大学を卒業する。この間にソ連共産党に入党する。1981年、哲学博士候補の学位を取得する。1982年からエリツィンの母校でもあるウラル工科大学（ウラル総合技術大学）で教職につき、同大学助手、助教授となる。 1987年、ソ連最初の政治クラブ「討論の演壇」を創設する。1989年3月、ソ連人民代議員に当選し、最高会議議員にも選出された。1990年、ソ連共産党を離党する。同年1月、エリツィン・ロシア最高会議議長全権代表兼直属調整顧問会議議長となり、エリツィン最側近となる。1991年6月のロシア大統領選挙では、エリツィン陣営の選挙参謀として、選挙運動を指揮した。かくてエリツィン大統領が誕生すると、国務長官（1991年 - 1992年「ロシア連邦国務長官」、1992年5月 - 11月「ロシア連邦大統領直属国家評議会書記」を兼務）になる。1991年11月から第一副首相を兼任、エリツィン政権内のナンバー2になる。1991年12月7日・8日の両日「ベロヴェーシの森の陰謀」と呼ばれるエリツィン、クラフチュク・ウクライナ大統領、シュシケビッチ・ベラルーシ最高会議議長のスラヴ3首脳によるソ連解体の筋書きを作った張本人とされる。このような政界の黒幕的性格から「灰色の枢機卿」とあだ名される。 しかし、あまりにも辣腕家であったブルブリスは敵も多く、ショック療法で市場経済をしゃにむに導入しようとしたエゴール・ガイダルとともに、反エリツィン陣営の攻撃の矢面に立たされた。1992年3月、大統領直属顧問会議副議長に就任、4月に第一副首相を解任される。5月に大統領直属国務長官となるが、11月26日に大統領直属国務長官制が廃止となる。同日に大統領首席顧問に就任するが、12月14日に解任と、エリツィンと反エリツィン陣営の対立の狭間にあった。 1993年12月の下院（国家会議）選挙で、急進改革派の政治ブロック「ロシアの選択」から比例区で下院議員に当選する。しかし4ヵ月後、「ロシアの選択」から離脱し、無所属となる。その後、シンクタンク「ロシア戦略財団」を創設し、総裁に就任する。1995年、スヴェルドロフスク州ペルヴォウラリスク小選挙区から立候補し下院議員に再選された。2001年から上院（連邦会議）議員。",

W latach 1677–1682 Gustaf studiował na uniwersytecie w Uppsali, a potem w Królewskich Archiwach (Riksarkivet). Następnie przebywał trzy lata w Londynie a potem czas jakiś w Paryżu. W 1686 został Kammerjunkrem przy dworze Wirtemberskim (gdzie rządził wówczas Eberhard Ludwik Wirtemberski), a rok później przeniósł się na dwór Karola XI, gdzie pełnił analogiczną funkcję, by w końcu zostać członkiem dworu następcy tronu (kronprins) Karola (przyszły Karol XII). W 1698 zmarł ojciec Cronhielma, po którym Gustaf odziedziczył dobra w Västmanlandii. Wówczas zaczął interesować się żywo polityką. W 1710 został posłem Riksdagu (riksdagsman) i wicelandmarszałkiem (zastępcą Lantmarskalka – przewodniczącego riksdagu). Potem został kanclerzem dworu (hovkansler – szwedzki kanclerz nadworny), radca rady królewskiej (kungligt råd) i kancelarii (kansliråd). W latach 1713–1714 był też kanclerzem uniwersytetu w Lund, a od 1719 także uniwersytetu w Uppsali. Karol XII uczynił w 1719 Cronhielma przewodniczącym Kolegium Handlu (Kommerskollegium) i przewodniczącym Rady Królewskiej. W 1712 Cronhielm otrzymał tytuł hrabiowski Cronhielm af Flosta. Jego żoną była Maria Wallenstedt, z która miał jedenaścioro dzieci. Po raz drugi ożenił się z baronówną Henriettą Beatą Horn af Marienborg.",

In 1996 Xu became political commissar of the Jinan Military Region. He became Vice-Chairman of the CMC in September 2004. He retired from office in March 2013. Xu was detained and put under investigation on suspicion of bribery in March 2014, in one of the highest profile corruption investigations in PLA history, and was expelled from the Communist Party in June 2014.

He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname Magnus, \"the Great\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. In mid-60 BC, Pompey joined Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gaius Julius Caesar in the unofficial military-political alliance known as the First Triumvirate, which Pompey's marriage to Caesar's daughter Julia helped secure. After the deaths of Julia and Crassus, Pompey sided with the optimates, the conservative faction of the Roman Senate. Pompey and Caesar then contended for the leadership of the Roman state, leading to a civil war. When Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, he sought refuge in Egypt, where he was assassinated. His career and defeat are significant in Rome's subsequent transformation from Republic to Empire.",

  "text" : "Paul Ainslie (born February 4, 1967) is a city councillor in Toronto, Canada. In 2006, he was appointed as an interim councillor in ward 41, and was then elected as the councillor for Ward 43 in Scarborough East. On February 1, 2006, City Council appointed Ainslie to fill the vacancy in Ward 41 that was created when Bas Balkissoon was elected in a provincial by-election in the riding of Scarborough-Rouge River. A condition of the appointment was that he would not run as a candidate in the 2006 election. However, when councillor David Soknacki announced his intention not to run in Ward 43, Ainslie put his name forward as a candidate to replace him. Ainslie used to be an executive assistant to Soknacki. Soknacki supported Ainslie's candidacy. During the election campaign in 2006, a video surfaced which showed Ainslie promising to Toronto City Council not to run. \"I will not run in Ward 41, or any other ward in the city.\" His campaign literature urged voters to \"return\" him to city hall. He said that his campaign team suggested using the word \"re-elect\". Ainslie said, \"I didn't think it was proper.\" Despite the controversy, he elected in Ward 43. In April 2007, he determined that it costs $20,000 annually to provide councillors and staff at City Hall offices with free coffee every day. He moved a motion in committee to remove the expense, but it failed to pass. During the Rob Ford drug allegation scandal, Ainslie was removed as chair from the city's government management committee and appointed as chair of the parks and environment committee. On October 11, 2013 he resigned from the mayor's executive committee and his role as chair of the parks and environment committee over differences with Ford's longterm strategic direction for the city. On May 3, 2013, Ainslie was stopped by a RIDE check on Kingston Road and was given a three-day licence suspension.",

Dzhaparidze, étnicamente georgiano, se unió a los bolcheviques en 1898, partido en el que se ganó el apodo de Aliosha (Alesha), trasladándose entonces a Bakú, capital azerí. Ayudó a fundar el Hummet, partido socialista musulmán y fue elegido delegado de la Unión Caucásica del Partido Obrero Socialdemócrata de Rusia (POSDR) en el III Congreso del POSDR celebrado en Londres en 1905. Durante su vida política fue muchas veces encarcelado o exiliado por sus actividades anti-zaristas en el Imperio Ruso. Tras la Revolución de Febrero de 1917 se convirtió en miembro del Comité Regional del Cáucaso, uniéndose a la Comuna de Bakú y siendo uno de los legendarios 26 Comisarios de Bakú. Desempeñó varias responsabilidades en la comuna. Dzhaparidze, junto a Stepán Shaumián, Meshadi Azizbekov, Iván Fioletov y otros comisarios, trataron de expandir la ideología comunista a través de todo el Cáucaso. Poco después de la caída de la comuna, la noche del 20 de septiembre de 1918, fue ejecutado por un pelotón de fusilamiento en una remota localidad entre las estaciones de Pereval y Ajcha-Kuima del Ferrocarril Trans-Caspio junto a otros comisarios. Dzhaparidze fue uno de los cuatro principales comisarios que ganaron un notable estatus en la Unión Soviética como héroe caído de la Revolución Rusa. Una calle de Sochi (Rusia) aún se llama en su honor y posee un pequeño busto en Moscú. Su monumento en Bakú, capital de Azerbaiyán, fue demolido en 2009.",

Following his resignation he said: Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that's been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.\" He opposed Australia's contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government and ran for Parliament against John Howard as a Green's Candidate in 2004. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a \"lie\". Since 2003 he has been active in Australian politics. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences.

Sewall never held elective office, although he was a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1888 to 1896. Arthur Sewall's main claim to fame had been as an exceptionally successful, wealthy shipbuilder and New England industrialist. He was a director of the Maine Central railroad and President of the Bath National Bank for years. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. He died not long after Bryan was nominated for the second time in 1900. Sewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.",

As Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission, Giambrone oversaw the largest expansion of bus service in Toronto. Giambrone secured over $8 billion in new funding to build light rail into areas of the city currently not served by rapid transit. An expansion of two subway lines also forms part of an overall $18 billion long-term expansion plan driven by Giambrone. On February 1, 2010, Giambrone announced his candidacy to succeed David Miller as Mayor of Toronto in the 2010 election, as a leading progressive candidate, showing second place in polls after John Tory dropped out, though Giambrone also had a high \"unfavourable\" rating of 40%.

Adela was born on 19 June 1885 in Manchester, England, into a politicised family: her father, Richard Pankhurst was a socialist and candidate for Parliament, and her mother Emmeline Pankhurst and sisters Sylvia and Christabel were leaders of the British suffragette movement. Her mother was of Manx descent. Adela attended the all-woman Studley Horticultural College in Warwickshire, and Manchester High School for Girls. As a teenager, Adela became involved in the militant Women's Social and Political Union founded by her mother and sisters. Following estrangement from her family, Adela emigrated to Australia in 1914. She was recruited during World War I as an organiser for the Women's Peace Army in Melbourne by Vida Goldstein. Pankhurst wrote a book called Put Up the Sword, penned a number of anti-war pamphlets and addressed public meetings on her opposition to the war and conscription. In August 1917, Pankhurst was arrested during a march against rising food prices in Melbourne, which had been part of a series of sometimes violent demonstrations, unusual for the time in that they were spearheaded by women. In September 1917, she married Tom Walsh of the Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia, with whom she had a son and five daughters. In 1920, Pankhurst became a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia, from which she was later expelled. She became disillusioned with communism and founded the anti-communist Australian Women's Guild of Empire in 1927. In 1941 Adela became one of the founding members of the right wing and nationalistic Australia First Movement. She visited Japan in 1939 and was arrested and interned in 1942 for her advocacy of peace with Japan.",

On council, she spearheaded expansion of child care spaces, advocated that transit money to be spent on buses rather than mega-projects such as RAV (now called the Canada Line), and convinced a majority of city council to deny Wal-Mart's application to build a new store.

Weed, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces Command Sergeant Major and veteran of the Vietnam War, has a B.A. from Yale University and M.P.A. from Princeton University. After working for the World Bank and in the private sector, he purchased a farm where he established a commercial vineyard and co-founded the Virginia Wineries Association. In 2002, Governor Mark Warner named Weed 5th District Trustee for the Virginia Land Conservation Trust Fund. In 2006, Weed faced competition for the Democratic Party nomination. Former Roanoke City Manager Bern Ewert argued that Weed had been beaten \"like a drum\" in 2004 and would probably lose again. Nevertheless, on May 20, 2006, Weed was chosen as the Democratic nominee by a 114-73 vote of the delegates to the party convention. In Weed's 2006 campaign, he emphasized the need for better treatment of military veterans. One of his campaign proposals was to establish a college for disabled veterans in the district. In both his campaigns, he advocated withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.",

However, during the 2006 general election for the seat, he was victorious. Thompson was challenged in the 2008 primary by the current holder of the seat but was victorious and was unchallenged in the November election. In 2010 Thompson won a 3-way primary battle but lost to Mark Grisanti, a Democrat who ran as a Republican. After the election Grisanti became a Republican.",

Taib was also the President of Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), which is part of the Barisan Nasional coalition. He is of ethnic Melanau descent. Taib is informally known as Pak Uban, which translates into \"white-haired uncle\". Among Chinese speaking communities he is known as Pek Moh (白毛) which means \"white hair\". Another informal name for him, in reference to the British Brooke family that ruled Sarawak as White Rajahs in the 19th and early 20th century, is the \"last white rajah\" or \"white-haired rajah\". Holding the post of Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1981 to 2014, he was the longest serving Chief Minister in Malaysia. He assumed the Chief Minister post at the age of 45. Being a member of the Malaysian Parliament for 38 years, Taib is also the second longest-serving parliamentarian in Malaysia after Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. Taib and his wider family are regularly accused of corruption and personally benefiting from Sarawak's natural and economic resources. On 12 February 2014, Taib handed over his resignation letter to the Governor of Sarawak to vacate his chief minister post, officially ending his 33 years of chief ministership. His former brother-in-law, Adenan Satem, succeeded him as Chief Minister with effect from 1 March 2014. At the same time, he received the official credentials as the 7th Sarawak Head of State from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong at Istana Negara on 28 February, and officially took the oath of office on the following day.

  "text" : "Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee (1901–1986) (Bengali: অজয় মুখোপাধ্যায়) was the fourth chief minister of West Bengal, India. He hailed from Tamluk, Purba Medinipur district, West Bengal. Born in 1901, he was one of the leaders of Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar (Tamrlipta National Government), which came into effect on 17 December 1942 during the Quit India Movement, a programme of civil disobedience launched in India in 1942. He was greatly influenced by Swami Vivekananda. Earlier a member of the Indian National Congress, he later became a leader in the Bangla Congress, which co-governed with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in two United Front governments in the 1960s and 1970s. He held the chief ministerial position in both these governments, from March to November 1967, and again from February 1969 to March 1970.In the year 1967 Ajoy Mukherjee defeated Prafulla Chandra Sen another Gandhian at Arambagh assembly constituency and became chief minister of West Bengal after Prafulla Chandra Sen. Architect of Ajoy Mukherjee's victory at Arambagh was Narayan Ch Ghosh the then students leader at arambagh. Narayan Ghosh accompanied Ajoy Mukherjee in a boat for several days to see sever flood effected areas in Arambagh & Ghatal subdivision during 1968. People of flood affected areas were enthused by Ajoy Mukherjee for his untired move to stand for them. Ajoy Mukherjee with some of his closed colleagues, viz. Pranob Mukherjee etc., joined Indian National Congress leaving Sushil Dhara- his long term associates. He was offered ministerial post at Centre by Indira Gandhi, but Ajoy Mukherjee saying his age and health condition had pushed Pranab Mukherjee.

August 2014 Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrats der Ukraine. Er war Mitbegründer der rechtsextremen Sozial-Nationalen Partei der Ukraine, des Vorläufers der heutigen Swoboda-Partei und war zeitweise auch in der Führung der nationalistischen Organisation Patriot der Ukraine aktiv. In seiner politischen Laufbahn wechselte er mehrfach die Parteizugehörigkeit, bei den Parlamentswahlen 2012 kandidierte er auf der Liste von Julija Tymoschenkos Vaterlandspartei und wurde erneut in die Werchowna Rada gewählt. Während der Euromaidan-Proteste galt Parubij als „Kommandeur des Maidan“, wobei er eng mit dem Führer des Rechten Sektors, Dmytro Jarosch, kooperierte. Bei der Bildung der Übergangsregierung Jazenjuk im Februar 2014 erhielt Parubij das Amt des Vorsitzenden des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates der Ukraine, von dem er am 7. August 2014 zurücktrat. Während der Krise in der Ukraine 2014 leitete er von April bis August, als der Sekretär des Nationalen Sicherheits- und Verteidigungsrates, die Operationen im Osten der Ukraine, die als „Anti-Terror-Operation“ bezeichnet wurden. Während dieser Zeit sprach sich Parubij für die Einführung einer Visumpflicht für russische Staatsbürger aus. Jazenjuk nahm gegenüber der Frage der Visa-Regelung in Brüssel eine vorsichtigere Haltung an, angesichts der Tatsache, dass eine große Zahl der Bürger, in erster Linie im Süden und Osten des Landes, interessiert seien an der Beibehaltung des visumfreien Verkehrs nach Russland, da sie dort arbeiten oder Familie hätten. Bei der Parlamentswahl 2014 kandidiert er auf Platz vier der Volksfront. Nach der Wahl wurde er stellvertretender Parlamentsvorsitzender der Werchowna Rada. Am 14. April 2016 wurde Andrij Parubij in Nachfolge des neuen Ministerpräsidenten Wolodymyr Hrojsman mit 284 Abgeordnetenstimmen zum neuen Parlamentspräsidenten der Werchowna Rada gewählt.",
