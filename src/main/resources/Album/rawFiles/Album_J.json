  "text" : "John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is the debut studio album by English rock musician John Lennon. It was released in 1970, after Lennon had issued three experimental albums with Yoko Ono and Live Peace in Toronto 1969, a live performance in Toronto credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The album was recorded simultaneously with Ono's debut avant garde solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, at Ascot Sound Studios and Abbey Road Studios using the same musicians and production team, and featured nearly identical cover artwork. John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is generally considered one of Lennon's finest solo albums, documenting with honesty and artistic integrity his emotional and mental state at that point in his career. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it fourth in its list \"The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years\" and in 2012, ranked it number 23 in \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\"."

Journey recorded a demo album prior to the release of Journey, with the same songs in different order and with Prairie Prince as the drummer. There were additional tracks, including instrumental pieces, that did not make it to the final product, including the original title track of the demo album, \"Charge of the Light Brigade\"."

  "text" : "Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began work on her next album after moving from her hometown, Ottawa, to Toronto; she did not make much progress until she traveled to Los Angeles, where she met Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection, and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds. The experimentation resulted in an alternative rock album that took influence from post-grunge and pop rock, and featured guitars, keyboards, drum machines, and harmonica. The album's lyrics touched upon themes of aggression and broken relationships, while Ballard introduced a pop sensibility to Morissette's bitter angst. The album went on to be a huge success, topping the charts in ten countries; it has sold more than 33 million units worldwide and ranks as one of the best-selling albums of all time. Jagged Little Pill received acclaim from music critics and was nominated for nine Grammy Awards, of which Morissette won five, including Album of the Year, making her the youngest artist in history to win the honour—a record she held for 14 years, until country/pop singer Taylor Swift won Album of the Year at the 2010 Grammy Awards for her 2008 album Fearless. Rolling Stone ranked Jagged Little Pill at number 327 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\"."

This is the only album to feature both Andrew Giddings on keyboards and Jonathan Noyce on bass, although both would stay with the band until 2007, resulting in Jethro Tull's longest ever unchanged line-up; they recorded just one other album, The Jethro Tull Christmas Album."

It is the first album by They Might Be Giants to include a full band arrangement, rather than synthesized and programmed backing tracks. The album's name, a reference to the man versus machine fable of John Henry, is an allusion to the band's fundamental switch to more conventional instrumentation, especially the newly established use of a human drummer instead of a drum machine. John Henry is TMBG's longest record and was the band's highest-charting adult album, having peaked at #61 on the Billboard 200, until 2011's Join Us, which peaked at #32. In 2013, the album was reissued across a double LP by Asbestos Records."

  "text" : "Joe's Garage is a 1979 rock opera by Frank Zappa. Zappa self-deprecatingly described the album as a \"stupid little story about how the government is going to do away with music.\" Originally released as two separate studio albums on Zappa Records, the project was later remastered and reissued as a triple album box set, Joe's Garage, Acts I, II & III, in 1987. The story is told by a character identified as the \"Central Scrutinizer\" narrating the story of Joe, an average adolescent male, who forms a garage rock band, has unsatisfying relationships with women, gives all of his money to a government assisted and insincere religion, explores sexual activities with appliances, and is imprisoned. After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity. The album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles, while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics. It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. Joe's Garage is noted for its use of xenochrony, a recording technique that takes guitar solos from older live recordings and overdubs them onto new studio recordings. All of the guitar solos on the album are xenochronous except for \"Crew Slut\" and \"Watermelon in Easter Hay\", a signature song that Zappa has described as the best song on the album, and according to his son Dweezil, the best guitar solo his father ever played. The album initially received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising its innovative and original music, but criticizing the scatological, sexual and profane nature of the lyrics. Since its original release, Joe's Garage has been reappraised as one of Zappa's best works. This is Official Release #28 and #29."

  "text" : "Journeyman is the eleventh studio album by blues/rock musician Eric Clapton, released in 1989. The album was heralded as a return to form for Clapton, who had struggled with alcohol addiction in the mid-1980s and had recently found sobriety. Much of it has an electronic sound, mostly influenced by the 1980s rock scene, but it also includes blues songs like \"Before You Accuse Me,\" \"Running on Faith,\" and \"Hard Times.\" The strongest single commercially from this album was \"Bad Love,\" which earned him Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 1990 Grammy Awards, and reached the No. 1 position on the Album Rock Chart. \"Pretending\" had also reached the No. 1 position on the Album Rock Chart the previous year, remaining at the top for five weeks (\"Bad Love\" had only stayed for three weeks). While the album was only a moderate commercial success at the time, reaching number 16 on the Billboard 200 chart, it went on to become his first solo studio album to go double platinum. This is one of Eric Clapton's favourite albums."

  "text" : "Junta (/ˌˈdʒʊntəˈ/ juun-tə) is the first official studio release from the American rock band Phish. The album was independently recorded at Euphoria Sound Studio, now known as Sound & Vision Media, in Revere, MA by engineer Gordon Hookailo. Some of the recording was documented on video tape by studio owner Howard Cook. The recording was released on tape in 1988, and did not appear in stores officially until May 8, 1989. The album was re-released by Elektra Records on October 26, 1992. The album is named after Ben \"Junta\" Hunter, the band's first official manager/agent, whose nickname is pronounced with a \"hard\" J and a \"short\" U. In addition to a few more traditionally structured songs, Junta contains symphonic-like epics and multi-part progressive rock suites. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on October 9, 1997, and was certified platinum on July 7, 2004. In February 2009, this album became available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats from LivePhish.com. On February 13, 2012, it was announced that Junta would be released on vinyl for the first time on April 21, 2012 as Limited Edition Deluxe 3-LP vinyl set, as part of Record Store Day. The LE Deluxe 3-LP vinyl set is limited to 5,000 individually numbered copies. The vinyl release was created from the original stereo master reels with lacquers cut by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering, and pressed onto 180g audiophile grade vinyl and includes a free MP3 download of the entire album (transferred from the new vinyl master). Chris Bellman also made two digital transfers from the original stereo master reels, one recorded at 24 bit / 96 kHz, and a second digital transfer recorded at 24 bit / 192 kHz. These digital files were sold at HDTracks. On this new release \"Contact\" is over a minute longer than in previous releases. \"Union Federal\", \"Sanity\", and \"Icculus\" did not appear on the original cassette release, but rather only on the Elektra version, which had extra space on the CD format. \"Union Federal\" was taken from a jam session, while \"Sanity\" and \"Icculus\" were recorded live on July 25, 1988. There was a mix up in adding them to the Elektra version post-date, so the May 3, 1988 date inside the album notes is incorrect. The 2009 LivePhish.com digital download also contained these three extra tracks, while the 2012 re-releases did not contain the extra tracks, as these were not part of the original album's stereo master reels."

  "text" : "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on September 19, 1989, by A&M Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came to be considered a role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics. Noted for its use of sample loop and utilizing swing note and synthesized percussion throughout its production, the album encompasses a variety of musical styles, such as new jack swing, hard rock, pop, dance and industrial music. The songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry, giving it appeal across multiple radio formats. It became the singer's second consecutive album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States. It also topped the ARIA Charts in Australia and peaked within the top ten positions of the album charts in Japan, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. Certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it emerged the biggest-selling album of 1990 and has sold an estimated twenty million copies worldwide. Due to its innovative production and lyrical exploration, critics have come to regard it as the pinnacle of Jackson's artistic achievement. It is included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and the British reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, among other publications \"best of\" album lists. It has been cited as an influence in various musical trends, inspiring numerous artists. It is the only album in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart to have seven commercial singles peak within the top five positions. It is also the only album to produce number one hits on the chart in three separate calendar years (1989–1991). The 30-minute Rhythm Nation 1814 film, a screenplay depicting two aspiring musicians whose lives are disrupted by substance abuse, aired on MTV to promote the album. Jackson received nine Grammy Award nominations, becoming the first female artist to be nominated for Producer of the Year and winning Best Long Form Music Video for Rhythm Nation 1814. Her Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut concert tour by a recording artist, in addition to setting venue records in Japan. She was regarded as a fashion icon, with her \"Rhythm Nation\" attire being emulated by youth. Proceeds from the tour were used to establish the Rhythm Nation Scholarship and fund other educational programs. Jackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her significant contributions to popular culture."

  "text" : "Justified is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake. It was released on November 4, 2002, by Jive Records. The album was written and recorded in a six-week period, during the hiatus of the singer's band NSYNC. For the album, Timberlake began to adopt a more mature image as an R&B artist opposed to the previous pop music recorded by the group. Most of the album was produced by The Neptunes (credited as \"Williams and Hugo\" on the album), with additional collaborators including Brian McKnight, Scott Storch, Timbaland, The Underdogs, and Carvin & Ivan. The album features guest appearances by Janet Jackson and rap duo Clipse. Primarily an R&B album, Justified also contains influences of dance-pop, funk and soul music. Justified received generally positive reviews from music critics; most of them complimented the mature progression of the singer's material, while some criticized its lyrical content. The album earned Timberlake four Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, and won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Justified debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and sold 439,000 copies in its first week. It was certified three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) denoting shipments of three million copies in the US. As of 2012, the album has sold over ten million copies worldwide. Four singles were released from Justified. The album's lead single, \"Like I Love You\", peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while two follow-up singles \"Cry Me a River\", and \"Rock Your Body\" peaked within the top-five on the chart. \"Like I Love You\", \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\" peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and in the top ten in Australia (with \"Rock Your Body\" topping the Australian chart), Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium. To further promote the album, Timberlake performed on several television shows and embarked on The Justified World Tour and the Justified and Stripped Tour; on the latter he was accompanied by American singer Christina Aguilera."

  "text" : "John Wesley Harding is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on December 27, 1967 by Columbia Records. Produced by Bob Johnston, the album marked Dylan's return to acoustic music and traditional roots, after three albums of electric rock music. John Wesley Harding shares many stylistic threads with, and was recorded around the same time as, the prolific series of home recording sessions with the Band, partly released in 1975 as The Basement Tapes, and released in complete form in 2014 as The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete. John Wesley Harding was exceptionally well received by critics and enjoyed solid sales, reaching #2 on the US charts and topping the UK charts. The commercial performance was considered remarkable considering that Dylan had kept Columbia from releasing the album with much promotion or publicity. Less than three months after its release, John Wesley Harding was certified gold by the RIAA. \"All Along the Watchtower\" became one of his most popular songs after it was recorded by Jimi Hendrix the following year. In 2003, the album was ranked number 301 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, moving to 303 in the 2012 version of that list."

  "text" : "Just Push Play is the 13th studio album by American rock band Aerosmith. It was released on March 5, 2001, making it the first Aerosmith album of the 21st century. The album was co-produced by song collaborators Marti Frederiksen and Mark Hudson. The album's first single, \"Jaded\", became a major Top 10 hit in the U.S. and around the world. As a result, Just Push Play was certified platinum within a month of its release. Subsequent singles \"Fly Away from Here\", \"Sunshine\", and \"Just Push Play\", though garnering some airplay, failed to impact the Hot 100 much, although the latter two charted on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart and the former charted on the Adult Top 40. In 2010, guitarist Joe Perry revealed his distaste for the album, stating that:"

  "text" : "Japanese Whispers: The Cure Singles Nov 82 : Nov 83 is a singles album by British group The Cure. It was released in late 1983 by their record company, Fiction Records. It includes the singles \"Let's Go to Bed\", \"The Walk\" and \"The Lovecats\". Two other tracks are the B-sides of these singles, although \"Mr. Pink Eyes\" (the second B-side for \"The Lovecats\") was not included. The songs were recorded when the band was in a transitional phase after bassist Simon Gallup left following a tour to promote the previous album, Pornography. Beginning with these singles, Lol Tolhurst switched from drums to keyboards, a role he kept until his departure in 1989. For first two singles' tracks The Cure is a duo consisting of Tolhurst and Robert Smith, with the addition of a session drummer for the tracks from \"Let's Go to Bed\". For the last single, a full band was assembled with the addition of bassist/producer Phil Thornalley, who had worked with the band on Pornography, and drummer Andy Anderson, a lineup which would continue for the Concert live album. In 1986, the singles' lead tracks were included in the Staring at the Sea compilation album, while all of the B-sides have been included in the 2004 B-sides and rarities box set Join The Dots. Japanese Whispers was the first Cure album to enter the Billboard 200 in the US, in early 1984."

It was his last on Cash Money Records before departing from it. The album was certified platinum July 20, 2004, becoming his third album to do so, after 400 Degreez and Tha G-Code. The album entered at #32 on the Billboard pop charts and sold over 100,000 copies in its first week. Juve the Great includes the hit single \"Slow Motion\" featuring Soulja Slim, who was shot dead almost a month before the album's release, which topped the Billboard Hot 100.

This was his first album since his debut Being Myself not exclusively produced by Mannie Fresh."

  "text" : "Jazz is the seventh studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 10 November 1978. Roy Thomas Baker temporarily reunited with the band and became their producer; it was three years since he co-produced their 1975 album A Night at the Opera, but this album also was the last he co-produced for the band. The album's varying musical styles were alternately praised and criticised. It reached #2 in the UK Albums Chart and #6 on the US Billboard 200. Jazz has sold over 5 million copies to date. Jazz was the first Queen album recorded outside the UK. Included in the liner notes is the humorous attribution \"Thunderbolt courtesy of God\", referring to the crash of thunder heard at the end of \"Dead on Time,\" which Brian May recorded with a portable audio recorder during a thunderstorm. The album artwork was suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a similar design painted on the Berlin Wall."

This album also contains several Taylor classic songs such as \"Secret O' Life\" and \"Terra Nova\", with the participation of Taylor's then-wife Carly Simon. At the 1978 Grammy Awards, Taylor won the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his chart-topping version of \"Handy Man\". JT itself was also nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to Rumours by Fleetwood Mac. JT stands as Taylor's biggest selling career album with over 3.5 million copies sold in the United States alone."

The group was made up of Cathy Douglas (also known as Cathy Dougher, and whose real name was Kathleen Dougherty), Patrice Holloway, and Cherie Moor (formerly known as Cheryl Jean Stoppelmoor and later better known as Cheryl Ladd). The group also released six singles in 1970 and 1971. All of the songs were re-released on a 2001 compilation, Stop, Look and Listen - The Capitol Recordings."

The anthology was divided by its compiler and co-producer, Yoko Ono, into four discs representing four eras in Lennon's solo career: \"Ascot\", \"New York City\", \"The Lost Weekend\" and \"Dakota\". John Lennon Anthology reached number 62 in the United Kingdom and number 99 in the United States, where it went gold. A one-disc distillation of the highlights of the box set was released as Wonsuponatime. Many of the tracks were edited down from their versions on John Lennon Anthology. Wonsaponatime failed to reach the US charts but peaked at number 76 in the UK."

  "text" : "John Lennon's jukebox is a jukebox – specifically a KB Discomatic made in the UK using a Swiss made mechanism – which Lennon had bought in 1965. Lennon filled it with forty singles to accompany him on tour. John Lennon's jukebox also refers to the compilation CD album closely based on the jukebox's musical contents. The jukebox surfaced in an auction of Beatles memorabilia at Christie's, and was sold for £2,500 ($4,907) to Bristol-based music promoter John Midwinter. Midwinter spent several years restoring the box and researching the discs, which had been catalogued in Lennon's spidery handwriting. As Midwinter's health began to deteriorate, he became anxious that a story of the jukebox and its music should feature in a documentary. Eventually, The South Bank Show broadcast a documentary on the jukebox in 2004 in which many of the represented artists, along with Sting, were interviewed. The project (which was commissioned only a few days after Midwinter died) was managed by Steve Jansen for the British television production company Initial, headed by Malcolm Gerrie. XM Satellite Radio's \"'60s On 6\" channel featured Lennon's jukebox singles as an insight to the former Beatle's personal taste in pop music."

  "text" : "Just Whitney... is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Whitney Houston, released on December 10, 2002 in North America by Arista Records. It was her first studio album in four years, since 1998's My Love Is Your Love, and after signing her new $100 million Arista contract in 2001. The album debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200, and number three of Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, with sales of 205,147 copies in the first week, not only beating her previous high first-week sales of 177,284 units with the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack but also logged her highest debut sales out of her SoundScan-era solo albums.

  "text" : "\"Joy to the World\" is a popular Christmas carol. The words are by English hymn writer Isaac Watts, based on the second half of Psalm 98 in the Bible. The song was first published in 1719 in Watts' collection; The Psalms of David: Imitated in the language of the New Testament, and applied to the Christian state and worship. Watts wrote the words of \"Joy to the World\" as a hymn glorifying Christ's triumphant return at the end of the age, rather than a song celebrating his first coming. The nations are called to celebrate because God's faithfulness to the house of Israel has brought salvation to the world. As of the late 20th century, \"Joy to the World\" was the most-published Christmas hymn in North America."

  "text" : "Just Be Free is a demo album released by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera the opportunity to use a recording studio and presented her with demo music with the understanding that they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record and Just Be Free has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States."

In addition to this sextet, there were an additional fourteen musicians. Having such a large amount of guests would be commonplace on the latter-day group's albums."

  "text" : "JoJo is the self-titled debut studio album by American singer of the same name. It was released on June 22, 2004 by Da Family Entertainment, Blackground Records, and Universal Records. Incorporating pop and R&B, JoJo was influenced by Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Beyoncé, amongst other of JoJo's idols. A special edition of the album featuring three bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the 14-track standard edition, which was only be made available in some European and Oceanian countries. On the album, JoJo co-wrote three out of the 17 tracks. While recording the album, JoJo worked with many producers, such as Brian Alexander Morgan, Soulshock and Karlin, Vincent Herbert, Mike City, Balewa Muhammad, Tre Black, Bink!, Kwamé \"K1 Mill\". and The Underdogs as well as others, to handle production for the album. JoJo recorded a number of songs for the album over an eight-month period. Amongst those included is a cover of R&B girl group SWV's 1993 hit single \"Weak\", in addition to one collaboration with Bow Wow, who features on the single release version of \"Baby It's You\". Occasionally, the album dips into other genres such as hip hop and soul music. The album was preceded by the release of JoJo's debut single, \"Leave (Get Out)\", which achieved critical and commercial success worldwide. In the United States, the single peaked inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and also topped the Pop 100 singles chart, making her the youngest artist in history to achieve this. In the United Kingdom, the single also performed well, reaching a peak of number two. Follow-up single \"Baby It's You\" featured rapper Bow Wow and became JoJo's second top 40 hit in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the song became her second Top 10 hit, peaking at number eight. The single also reached the top-10 of New Zealand, climbing to a peak of number ten. The third and final single, \"Not That Kinda Girl\" was released internationally only. However, it did see a minor release onto US radio. Due to the lack of a physical copy, the single failed to chart in the United States, becoming her first to do so. The single did manage to chart in Australia and Germany, however, the chart performance of the song was an overall failure. JoJo was promoted mainly through live, televised performances, appearing on shows such as On Air with Ryan Seacrest as well as performing at the 2004 Kid's Choice Awards. Aside from network appearances, JoJo also embarked on The Cingular Buddy Bash Tour with other artists, and as the opening act on the European leg of Usher's Truth Tour. The album debuted and peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200, selling 95,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 15, 2004, denoting US sales in excess of one million copies. The album also proved to be a success elsewhere. In the United Kingdom and Germany, the album has been certified gold, while in Canada, the album received a platinum certification. The album has sold over three million copies worldwide."

  "text" : "Janet (stylized as janet.) is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on May 18, 1993, by Virgin Records America. Prior to its release, Jackson was at the center of a high-profile bidding war over her recording contract. In 1991, her original label A&M sought to renew her contract, while others, such as Atlantic, Capitol, and Virgin all vied to sign her. After meeting with Virgin owner Richard Branson, she signed with the label for a $40 million contract, making her the world's then-highest paid musical act. Criticism that her success in the music industry was attributed to being a member of the Jackson family and a producer-dependent artist led her to write all lyrics for the album, in addition to co-producing every song and co-writing each of their arrangements with the songwriting/production duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Its title, read \"Janet, period.\", is meant to disassociate her public image from her family, dropping her surname. While pop and R&B had been standard components in her music, she broadened her compositions by incorporating hip hop, opera, house and jazz, eliminating the rigid, industrial sound of her previous records. Although she earned a reputation as an advocate for sexual abstinence with her 1986 single \"Let's Wait Awhile\", the theme of Janet is sexual intimacy—an abrupt departure from her conservative image. Much of the acclaim for the album focused on her lyrics that emphasized the female perspective on sexuality and the demand for practicing safe sex. Academics have argued the erotic imagery in her music videos released to promote the album's singles have contributed to a higher degree of sexual freedom among women. The album topped the record charts in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. In the US, it became the singer's third consecutive album to top the Billboard 200 and her first to debut at number one. Selling 350,000 copies in its first week, it set a record for the highest first week sales for a female artist at that time. Certified sixfold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has sold over seven million copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan and an estimated 20 million copies worldwide. It cemented her as an international icon and sex symbol, and is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time. Producing six top ten hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, Janet remains one of only seven albums in the chart's history to achieve that feat. \"That's the Way Love Goes\" became Jackson's most successful single in the US, staying atop the Hot 100 for eight weeks, as well as topping the singles charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. It received two Grammy Award nominations in 1994, winning Best R&B Song. Her ballad \"Again\"—written for the 1993 feature film Poetic Justice—also topped the Hot 100 and garnered nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song. The MTV-sponsored Janet World Tour supporting the album received critical acclaim for Jackson's elaborate stage performances, reinforcing her reputation as one of the preeminent artists of the MTV generation."

  "text" : "Janet Jackson is the self-titled debut album by American recording artist Janet Jackson. It was released on September 21, 1982, by A&M Records. Jackson's career as a recording artist was established by her father and manager Joseph Jackson, who arranged her recording contract with her recording company. Prior to her rise to fame, the singer had no interest in pursuing a musical career. Despite this, she was motivated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. After acting in the variety show The Jacksons, she began starring in several TV series and commenced recording her debut album. Its artwork depicts Jackson submerged in a swimming pool. Janet Jackson is described as a post-disco and R&B record. Songwriters Angela Winbush and René Moore contributed to much of the album's lyrics. Moore and Winbush share production credits with Foster Sylvers, Jerry Weaver, and Bobby Watson. Janet Jackson received mixed reviews from music critics who found its content bland, although highlighted some tracks. It also managed to chart on the Billboard 200 and in New Zealand. Three singles from the album had little impact on Billboard charts, among them \"Young Love\", \"Come Give Your Love to Me\" and \"Say You Do\". In order to promote Janet Jackson, she performed the song on American TV shows American Bandstand and Soul Train in 1982."

The second track on the album, \"Up Yours\", was the only song from Jed found on the band's compilation album What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce. The song \"No Way Out\" was also included on the band's most recent compilation album Volume Two, which consisted of other album tracks, b-sides and rarities. The album was re-released on CD on February 22, 1994. The album was named after painter Jed Jackson, who was Robby Takac's art teacher at Medaille College and who painted the cover artwork, which is entitled \"Arkansas Sunset\". Jed is from Arkansas."

It was recorded live on August 7, 1971 in Pauley Pavilion on the campus of UCLA in Los Angeles. A notable inclusion on this album is \"Billy the Mountain\", Zappa's long, narrative parody of rock operas, which were gaining popularity at that time. Often overlooked by reviewers, this album marks an important period in the band's career due to the extensive use of The Turtles band, soon to be dissolved with Zappa's stage fall. The song \"Eddie, Are You Kidding?\" refers to Edward Nalbandian. The album was reissued in a digitally remastered version on CD by Rykodisc in 1990 and in 1995. All CD editions remove the composition credits. This is Official Release #14."

  "text" : "Jack Johnson, later reissued as A Tribute to Jack Johnson, is a 1971 studio album and soundtrack by American jazz musician Miles Davis. In 1970, Davis was asked by Bill Cayton to record music for his documentary of the same name on the life of boxer Jack Johnson. Johnson's saga resonated personally with Davis, who wrote in the album's liner notes of Johnson's mastery as a boxer, his affinity for fast cars, jazz, clothes, and beautiful women, his unreconstructed blackness, and his threatening image to white men. This was the second film score he had composed, after Ascenseur pour l'échafaud in 1957. The music recorded for Jack Johnson reflected Davis' interest in the eclectic jazz fusion of the time while foreshadowing the hard-edged funk that would fascinate him in the next few years. Having wanted to put together what he called \"the greatest rock and roll band you have ever heard\", Davis recorded with a line-up featuring guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, keyboardists Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea, clarinetist Bennie Maupin, and drummers Jack DeJohnette and Billy Cobham. The album's two tracks were drawn from one recording session on April 7 and edited together with recordings from February 1970 by producer Teo Macero. Jack Johnson was released by Columbia Records on February 24, 1971. It was a turning point in Davis' career and has since been viewed as one of his greatest works. JazzTimes later wrote that while his 1970 album Bitches Brew had helped spark the fusion of jazz and rock, Jack Johnson was Davis' most brazen and effective venture into rock, \"the one that blew the fusion floodgates wide open, launching a whole new genre in its wake\". According to McLaughlin, Davis considered it to be his best jazz-rock album."

While the album does not have one theme that binds all the songs, several tracks deal with \"high concepts\" such as religion (\"Church\") and death (\"Family Reserve\" & \"Since The Last Time\"). Lovett's renowned sense of humor and whimsy are temporarily set aside in favor of reflective musings on heartbreak and loss. The album's title is a pun made up of the names of three books that appear sequentially in the Old Testament: Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. In keeping with Lovett's other releases, Joshua received critical acclaim but failed to vault the singer into mainstream success. First single \"You've Been So Good Up To Now\" was a minor hit on rock radio, peaking at #36 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart."

It is a largely acoustic retrospective version of her highly successful third album, Jagged Little Pill (1995); the songs are stripped-down versions of the originals, though producer Glen Ballard has augmented them with studio production effects to create an alternative pop album. The album was released by Maverick Records in the United States on June 13, 2005, available only at North American Starbucks outlets until July 26, 2005, when it was made available in other retail stores. This limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and HMV Canada, who retaliated by removing from sale Morissette's other albums for the duration of Starbucks' exclusive month-long sale. The album's single in the U.S. was \"Hand in My Pocket\". The cover artwork is a sepia-toned tribute to the cover of the original Jagged Little Pill."

  "text" : "Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb is the third studio album released by Tripping Daisy in 1998. The album was produced by Eric Drew Feldman and Tripping Daisy. Songs on this album included radio hit \"Sonic Bloom\". Artwork was created by Tim DeLaughter. This is the first of two albums (the second being the band's swan-song, Tripping Daisy (2000) to feature Ben Curtis on drums; he would later go on to form The Secret Machines and School of Seven Bells. The album expanded the band's sound, ditching most of their \"90's Grunge sound\" for a more layered \"Neo-Psychedelic\" sound similar to Clouds Taste Metallic Era Flaming Lips. The album was critically acclaimed, but sold poorly due to lack of support and marketing from the now defunct label Island Records which was going under at the time. The album is now out of print. \"Indian Poker Pt. 2 & 3\" (a combined cover of the Brainiac songs from the album Hissing Prigs in Static Couture, 1996) was \"dedicated to the late Timmy Taylor and his band, Brainiac\" in the album's liner notes."

  "text" : "Jolene is Dolly Parton's 13th solo studio album, produced by Bob Ferguson. It was released by RCA Records in February 1974. The title track, \"Jolene\", tells the tale of a housewife confronting a beautiful seductress who she believes is having an affair with her husband. It became Parton's second solo number-one country single; it also was a moderate pop hit for her, and also did well in the United Kingdom. It has been covered by numerous performers. The album was released around the time Parton was embarking on a solo career, after having spent seven years as part of Porter Wagoner's weekly TV series and road show, and one of the album's songs, \"I Will Always Love You\", was reportedly written to express the remorse Parton felt over the professional breakup. Released as the album's second single, it also became a number-one country single. In 1992, Whitney Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" was a mega-hit pop ballad. Two of the album's songs had been released on previous Parton albums: \"Early Morning Breeze\" was a remixed version of a recording which had first appeared on 1971's Coat of Many Colors album (the Jolene version was remixed to more prominently feature the bass and electric steel), while \"Lonely Coming Down\" had first appeared on Parton's Wagoner tribute album, My Favorite Songwriter: Porter Wagoner, from 1972. Another re-issue was released in conjunction with Dolly's 2007 European Tour along with two other older out-of-print albums. This re-issue included additional previously unreleased songs. In 2010, Sony Music reissued the 2007 CD Jolene in a triple-feature CD set with Coat of Many Colors and My Tennessee Mountain Home and they have never been out of print."

  "text" : "Jump5 is the self-titled debut album from Christian pop group Jump5. It was released on August 14, 2001 through Sparrow Records. Two re-releases followed: the first featured the \"Start Jumpin'\" bonus track targeted towards Christian audiences, while the second featured a Radio Disney-targeted version of \"Start Jumpin'\" with different lyrics plus a cover of Lee Greenwood's God Bless the USA to remember the lives lost after the September 11th attacks. A portion of sales from the second re-release was donated to families who lost a loved one during the attacks on September 11, 2001. \"Spinnin' Around\" was released as the album's lead Radio Disney single. A music video for this song was also filmed for release on VHS and DVD. The Radio Disney versions of \"Start Jumpin'\" and \"God Bless the USA\" were both released for airplay on Radio Disney. The latter single became a #1 hit on that radio network."

The Jackson 5's versions of \"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\" and \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" remain frequent radio requests during the Christmas season. The album spent all four weeks at the number one position on Billboard magazine's special Christmas Albums chart that the magazine published in December 1970, making it the best-selling Christmas album of that year. It has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide. In 2003, Universal Motown re-released the album with \"Little Christmas Tree\" (from A Motown Christmas). In 2009, this configuration was released as Ultimate Christmas Collection with Christmas messages, remixes, and a Christmas medley, and again as Merry Christmas Jackson 5."

  "text" : "Joan Baez (/baɪz/, born January 9, 1941 as Joan Chandos Baez) is an American folk singer, songwriter, musician, and activist whose contemporary folk music often includes songs of protest or social justice. Baez has performed publicly for over 55 years, releasing over 30 albums. Fluent in Spanish and English, she has recorded songs in at least six other languages. She is regarded as a folk singer, although her music has diversified since the counterculture days of the 1960s and now encompasses everything from folk rock and pop to country and gospel music. Although a songwriter herself, Baez generally interprets other composers' work, having recorded songs by the Allman Brothers Band, the Beatles, Jackson Browne, Leonard Cohen, Woody Guthrie, Violeta Parra, The Rolling Stones, Pete Seeger, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder and many others. In recent years, she has found success interpreting songs of modern songwriters such as Ryan Adams, Josh Ritter, Steve Earle and Natalie Merchant. Her recordings include many topical songs and material dealing with social issues. She began her recording career in 1960 and achieved immediate success. Her first three albums, Joan Baez, Joan Baez, Vol. 2, and Joan Baez in Concert all achieved gold record status and stayed on the Billboard and other record album charts for two years. Baez has had a popular hit song with \"Diamonds & Rust\" and hit covers of Phil Ochs's \"There but for Fortune\" and The Band's \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\". Other songs associated with Baez include \"Farewell, Angelina\", \"Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word\", \"Joe Hill\", \"Sweet Sir Galahad\" and \"We Shall Overcome\". She was one of the first major artists to record the songs of Bob Dylan in the early 1960s; Baez was already an internationally celebrated artist and did much to popularize his early songwriting efforts. Baez also performed three songs at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and has displayed a lifelong commitment to political and social activism in the fields of nonviolence, civil rights, human rights and the environment."

  "text" : "Janet Remixed (stylized as Janet.Remixed) is the second remix album (seventh overall) by American R&B-pop singer Janet Jackson. Released on March 13, 1995, it featured two non-album B-sides, including the radio hit \"And on and On\" and \"70's Love Groove\", as well as a number of exclusive remixes of tracks from the Janet album. The rare B-side to the single \"If\", \"One More Chance\", was not included on the CD version of janet. Remixed but on vinyl and cassette versions. However, like 1987's Control: The Remixes, it was never given a commercial release in Jackson's native United States."

  "text" : "Japan Live '94 (also known as Live in Japan) a live album that was recorded by Savatage. The show that was recorded for the release was held in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan on November 12, 1994 and was the last show on the short Handful of Rain tour. Due to a lack of time on the CD, the entire show was not released onto CD. Missing songs on the CD include \"Conversation Piece\", \"Stare Into the Sun\", \"Damien\" and \"Hall of the Mountain King\". However, when the concert was released to VHS, these songs were included. The release also has two covers. One featuring both Johnny Lee Middleton and Zachary Stevens (Live in Japan), whilst the other features Zak Stevens on his own (Japan 'Live 94). Despite the CD jacket of the latter record depicting Zak wearing a T-shirt with a red and white circle and cross, Zak, in fact, wore a Corrosion of Conformity T-shirt at the concert, and it was likely \"censored\" due to label issues. The show is noted for featuring Jon Oliva in a prominent role, his first since \"leaving\" the band in 1992. Jon has an extended piano intro on \"Gutter Ballet\" and shares lead vocals with Stevens, making it his first performance as a lead vocalist with the band for 2 years. Oliva also performs rhythm guitar for \"Hall of the Mountain King\". The show was originally released on VHS in 1996 in Japan and in 1998 in North America. In 2000, plans were revealed for the show to be released onto DVD with a possibility of bonus content. A release date of October 2000 was publicised by the band, but possibly due to Nuclear Blast being bought by Century Media, the band were unable to release the DVD. Since then, there has not been an announcement of an official DVD release, although copies of the concert have been circulated on DVD. March 2010, a greatest hit compilation called Still The Orchestra Plays: Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2 will be released, with the '94 concert included on a bonus DVD. The quality hasn't improved much from the VHS-version."

  "text" : "Join Hands is the second studio album by the English post-punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees. It was released in September 1979 by the record label Polydor. Upon its release, it was hailed by the British press, including Melody Maker, Sounds, NME and Record Mirror. Join Hands took the topic of World War I as its inspiration. Musically, it is darker than the band's debut album The Scream: it sounds more claustrophobic and more haunting. It was the last album with the band's first recorded line-up, as the guitarist John McKay and the drummer Kenny Morris quit the group after a disagreement at the beginning of the British Join Hands tour on the day of the album's release. The record peaked at No. 13 on the UK Albums Chart. \"Playground Twist\" was the sole single released from the album. In 2015, Join Hands was repressed on vinyl with the very first artwork that the band had presented to Polydor in 1979."

It was recorded at Surrey Sound studio with Nigel Gray as co-producer, and was released on 6 June 1981 by record label Polydor. Two singles were released from Juju: \"Spellbound\" and \"Arabian Knights\". The album was commercially successful in the UK. It was acclaimed by critics upon its release, with praise given particularly to John McGeoch's unconventional guitar playing and Siouxsie's vocal performances. It remains a critical favourite and is seen as a landmark album of post-punk."

  "text" : "Jamboree is the second album by Beat Happening, released in 1988 through K Records/Rough Trade Records. All songs were produced by Steve Fisk with assistance from Screaming Trees members Mark Lanegan and Gary Lee Conner (who plays a brief guitar solo on \"Midnight a Go-Go\"), except \"Cat Walk,\" produced by Patrick Maley, and \"The This Many Boyfriends Club,\" recorded live by Rich Jensen. The album marks a darker approach to the Twee pop for which the band is known, due largely to a thicker production than is present on the group's earlier recordings and the dominance of tracks written by Calvin Johnson, while Heather Lewis only provides vocals on two songs, the uncharacteristically brash \"In Between\" and the more typically understated \"Ask Me.\" At the time of the album's release, Calvin described Jamboree's sound as \"dark and sexy.\" Still, the band retained their emphasis on exuberance over musicianship, as Bret Lunsford stated in an interview that, while recording album opener \"Bewitched,\" his guitar string got stuck on a protruding screw and he continued to play through the song, hitting the string a bit harder until it became unstuck. This album was reportedly one of Kurt Cobain's favorites. Two tracks from the album, \"Bewitched\" and \"Indian Summer,\" were listed as essential listening in Pitchfork Media's 2005 article on Twee Pop entitled \"Twee as Fuck.\" \"Indian Summer\" is perhaps the group's best-known song, as it was famously covered by Dream pop group Luna, whose lead singer, Dean Wareham, joked in The Shield Around the K: The Story of K Records, a documentary film on the history of Calvin's K Records, that the song was \"indie's 'Knocking on Heaven's Door'-- everybody's done it.\" The song was also covered by Ben Gibbard for the soundtrack to the Kurt Cobain documentary About a Son. Allmusic said of the album \"each cut is a marvel of innocence and ingenuity.\""

  "text" : "Joe's Corsage is a CD of material recorded by Frank Zappa with The Mothers of Invention in the mid-1960s, before the recording of their debut album Freak Out! (1966). The album was compiled by archivist Joe Travers, and its title is a play on Zappa's 1979 work Joe's Garage. A number of the recordings featured on Joe's Corsage are demo versions of songs that would later appear on Freak Out!. The first set of demos, probably recorded in 1965, feature the guitar of Henry Vestine, who would later be a member of Canned Heat. Also included are covers of the Righteous Brothers' \"My Babe\", and Marvin Gaye's \"Hitch Hike\". This is Official Release #72."

  "text" : "J.Lo is the second studio album and most successful album to date by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on January 23, 2001, by Epic Records. Preceding the release for the follow-up of her commercially successful debut album On the 6 (1999). On this album, Lopez had more creative control over J.Lo. Its title refers to the nickname her fans gave her, and she described it as a homage to her supporters. Lopez began recording the album under the working title 'The Passionate Journey', writing lyrics that focused on her own personal experiences. For the album, she hired producers such as Cory Rooney, Troy Oliver, Dan Shea and Sean Combs, (her boyfriend at the time), all of whom contributed to her first album. Musically, J.Lo is a pop album, which also encompasses genres such as R&B, Latin pop, retro and dance-pop. It was considered more daring than On the 6, including more explicit language and provocative lyrics about sex; it also deals with themes of empowerment and relationships. Upon its release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its manufactured sound, although some praised its Spanish songs and dance material. Commercially, J.Lo became Lopez's most successful album. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, on the same week as her film The Wedding Planner, opened at the top of the domestic box office, making her the first entertainer to have both a number one film and album simultaneously. The album was certified quadruple platinum in the United States, and became the sixth best-selling album of the year worldwide. It has sold 4 Million copies in the United States and 12 Million copies worldwide. \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was released as the album's lead single on December 2, 2000, which reached the top five in the United States and number one in United Kingdom. The album's second single, \"Play\" (released on March 27, 2001), reached the top twenty in most countries and top five in United Kingdom. The Latin pop song, titled \"Ain't It Funny\" was released as the album's third single on June 20, 2001. \"I'm Real\" was serviced to radio as the album's fourth and final single on September 4, 2001. To further its success, record executives at Epic recruited Ja Rule of Murder Inc Records, who is popular in the Urban market, to create a remix of the song, \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\". The remix, which featured Ja Rule, shifted Lopez's personal style from pop to a more hip-hop and urban-oriented sound. It was the number one song in the United States at the time of the September 11 attacks for 5 non-consecutive weeks."

  "text" : "Justus is the eleventh studio album by The Monkees. The album was recorded in celebration of their 30th anniversary and released on October 15, 1996 (although the television show premiered on September 12, 1966, Justus does coincide with the release of their first album, The Monkees, which was released on October 10, 1966). This album (released on CD) featured the return of Michael Nesmith. Justus was the first Monkees album since Head was released in 1968 to feature all four Monkees. It was also the final album to feature Davy Jones before his death in 2012. Although Nesmith sang lead vocals only on a remake of the 1968 song \"Circle Sky\", he did write the Dolenz-vocal song, \"Admiral Mike\", and provided background vocals for all tracks. Although preliminary work on the album was begun using songs from various writers, upon Nesmith's agreement to join the production it was agreed that all songs would be written only by the four members of the group. The four also produced and recorded all the tracks jointly, making it the first Monkees album since Headquarters to be produced entirely by the group as a single unit, and the first album ever to be recorded by the foursome alone. A video was also produced to promote the album. \"Circle Sky\" is a remake from the Head soundtrack, with new lyrics from Nesmith. \"You and I\" is a different song than the song with the same name on Instant Replay. It originally appeared on a 1976 album, Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart, recorded during a reunion of Jones and Dolenz with Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, who were the band's first writers and producers. A different version of \"It's Not too Late\" appears on Jones's solo album Just for the Record, Vol. 4. The title is pronounced as either \"Justice\" or \"Just Us\", the latter implying that only the four Monkees perform on the album. The tracks \"Circle Sky\", \"You and I\" and \"Regional Girl\" were promoted, with music videos, in the 1997 television special \"Hey, Hey, It's The Monkees\". These songs, along with \"Oh, What A Night\" were performed as part of the 30th anniversary reunion tour. While all four members of the Monkees receive producer's credit, Michael Nesmith was the one that ultimately had the role of producing and mixing the project while the other three Monkees were on tour that year."

The album featured Lewis's hit \"High School Confidential\", but producer Sam Phillips did not include Lewis's bigger hits such as \"Great Balls of Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On.\" The album is sometimes referred to as High School Confidential. The back cover of the LP feature a large picture of Sun Records President Sam Phillips admiring Lewis at the piano in the famous studio at 706 Union Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee. Phillips, then working to promote his latest star Lewis, also wrote the liner notes for the album noting that Lewis \"is regarded as the very epitome of rock and roll\"  In keeping with an occasional record industry practice of the time (1958) the album was also released in 45rpm format, the twelve songs being divided over a series of three 7\" Extended Play (EP) records, Sun EPs 108,109 and 110 (pictured). The album is currently available on CD, featuring bonus tracks from his first EP, \"The Great Ball of Fire\" (Sun EP 107). Cub Koda described the selections found on Jerry Lee Lewis as \"a curious mixture\" with \"a great deal of his best material [being] inexplicably left off\", but the album still being a \"terrific debut\""

By 2007, the album had sold 100,000 copies in the United States and 158,000 worldwide. The album was recorded live in the studio, without overdubs. The title is a reference to Adams' hometown of Jacksonville, North Carolina, which has been referenced throughout his career. Several limited American releases contained a DVD entitled September (which was originally intended to be the title of the album), which featured a 20 minute documentary about the band on the road and in the studio. Bassist Catherine Popper is featured in the photograph on the album cover."

  "text" : "Jubilee is the fourth studio album released in 1998 by Grant Lee Buffalo. The single \"Truly,Truly\" received significant radio airplay, appearing on Billboard's Modern Rock chart for 13 weeks while peaking at #11. According to Grant Lee Phillips, the album may have suffered from high expectations at the label. \"The celebrational spirit of Jubilee actually brought a renewed optimism to me personally. The album was well received and understandably the expectations at the label were high, probably too high. Although the highly refined Jubilee had brought the band considerable success at radio with \"Truly, Truly,\" a shift within the industry was well underway. The label's constant nagging about \"Call-out Response\" was both a new term and a bewildering concept to our ears. The basic strategy: a radio station arranges to call up a listerner who is asked to consume about 30 songs over the phone, perhaps 20 seconds of each. From this remote encounter, the listener will then proceed to judge the material. Insufficient call-out response was a big reason that Jubilee hardly got a shot at Warners. Grant Lee Buffalo tunes are often like an old car or an old amp that needs a few seconds to get warmed up, but when it does... look out! Meanwhile, a new crop of young record buyers, the largest since the Baby Boomer era, were now being targeted to the exclusion of Gen-Xers, like myself, still waiting for the Pixies to reform. The album would be the last for the band, though Phillips has released a number of solo albums. \"As for Grant Lee Buffalo, I sensed they were beginning to wonder if we'd ever get through finishing school. Before that could happen, band and label parted as did Peters and myself. The scenery was changing and I was looking for new explorations. I'm sure we all were. Perhaps we always will be.\""

  "text" : "Jam Science is the second album by English pop group Shriekback. It was released in two versions in 1984, and was reissued on CD in a two-disc special release from the band themselves, with the second disc being a live show at Hatfield. The first edition, issued on Y Records in early 1984, was the final release by the label. As the company's final activity, label owner Dick O'Dell assembled an unfinished version of the album from rough mixes without the group's permission; however as the album was contractually recorded for the label, it is not an unauthorised release. Y was a UK record company, but this album was manufactured and distributed in the Netherlands by Sound Products Holland BV, and was out of print by the time the second edition was released. The second edition, issued on Arista Records in late 1984, is the version sanctioned by the group, and reached number 85 in the UK album chart; \"Hand on My Heart\" and \"Mercy Dash\" were also issued as singles, both on Arista, with the former reaching number 52 in the UK singles chart."

  "text" : "Just Another Diamond Day is the debut album by the English folk singer-songwriter, Vashti Bunyan, and was released on Philips Records in December 1970 (see 1970 in music). Much of the album is a musical reflection on Bunyan and traveling partner Robert Lewis's experiences while traveling by horse and wagon through Scotland in 1968. It highlighted Bunyan's vocals with minimal instrumental accompaniment that was arranged by contemporary musical artists supervised under record producer Joe Boyd. Upon release, Just Another Diamond Day went relatively unnoticed commercially as it failed to chart nationally. Stricken by the demoralizing and disillusioning outcome, Bunyan began a self-imposed exile from the music industry to live a low-profile lifestyle. Over the years, the album has received more attention among record collectors and bootleggers, resulting in official reissues that sparked a revival in Bunyan's music career. Although it was largely overlooked by the public at the time of its release, the album's critical standing has improved over the years and today Just Another Diamond Day is now by many considered one of the best works in British folk."

  "text" : "Journey to the Centre of the Earth is the second solo album from the English keyboardist Rick Wakeman, released on 3 May 1974 by A&M Records. The album is a live recording of his second of two concerts on 18 January 1974 at the Royal Festival Hall in London. With its concept based on Jules Verne's science fiction novel of the same name, the album tells the story of Professor Lidenbrok, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans, who follow a passage to the Earth's centre originally discovered by Arne Saknussemm, an Icelandic alchemist. Wakeman performs with the London Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Choir, and a group of hand-picked musicians for his rock band, which later became the English Rock Ensemble. Actor David Hemmings narrates the story. Journey to the Centre of the Earth was overall well received by music critics. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, the first album from A&M to do so, and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in October 1974 for 500,000 copies sold in the United States. The album earned Wakeman a nomination for an Ivor Novello Award and a Grammy Award. In 1999, Wakeman released a sequel, Return to the Centre of the Earth. He re-recorded the album with additional parts previously removed from the original score due to time constraints, in 2012."

  "text" : "Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969), also known as JLo, is an American singer, actress, dancer, fashion designer, author, and producer. Her acting debut came with a minor role in the film My Little Girl (1986); later Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color in 1991, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. She received her first leading role in the Selena biopic of the same name in 1997. For her role in Out of Sight the following year, Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She ventured into the music industry in 1999 with her debut studio album On the 6 preceded by the number-one single \"If You Had My Love\". With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her film The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, while her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Along with Pitbull and Claudia Leitte, she recorded \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\", which served as the official song of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. With a cumulative film gross of over US$3 billion, she is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, as well as its highest paid Latin entertainer. Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. Beyond entertainment, Lopez enjoys a highly successful business career consisting of various clothing lines, accessories, fragrances, a production company, and television shows and a charitable foundation, among other ventures. Lopez's personal relationships have attracted worldwide media attention; she has been married three times. Following the breakdown of her first marriage, Lopez dated rapper and entertainment mogul Sean Combs. Following the breakdown of her second marriage, to husband Cris Judd, she had a high-profile relationship with actor Ben Affleck, with their planned wedding being cancelled four days before the ceremony. Lopez then wed longtime friend Marc Anthony; they separated after seven years of marriage. Lopez gave birth to their twins, Emme and Maximilian, in 2008."

  "text" : "Jimi Plays Monterey is a posthumous live album by Jimi Hendrix released in February 1986. The album documents The Jimi Hendrix Experience's performance at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 18, 1967. As well as songs from the band's debut album Are You Experienced, Monterey also includes covers of \"Killing Floor\" (Howlin' Wolf), \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (Bob Dylan), \"Rock Me Baby\" (B. B. King) and \"Wild Thing\" (Chip Taylor). The version of \"Wild Thing\" on the album is one of the most notable live performances ever, as, in an iconic moment in rock history, he sets his guitar alight after the song and then smashes it. Jimi Plays Monterey is also a short film directed by D. A. Pennebaker documenting the same performance as the album, also released in 1986. It is notable for containing several interviews with rock stars, and containing an art piece by Denny Dent during the performance of \"Can You See Me\"."

  "text" : "Journey of a Gemini is the fourth studio album by American singer Donell Jones. The album's release date was pushed back numerous times due to record label complications of the Sony BMG merger. The album had been given critical acclaim, but due to very poor promotion by his record label LaFace, sales have been lower than expected. Despite that setback, it was Jones' highest charting album on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart where it topped at number one, while entering the Top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart."

  "text" : "Just Good Old Rock and Roll is the fifth studio album by The Electric Prunes, released in 1969. It was recorded with a lineup put together by Wilson-Fisher management for David Hassinger, who owned the name, during a period in which the original group was disbanded. This album is notable also for taking the Prunes' music decidedly away from the previous experimentation and underground psychedelia into (as the title suggests) more driving rock music. While there are elements of mild psychedelia present, the group's new direction pointed towards the boogie-rock that would be further developed in the 1970s by bands such as the James Gang and Foghat. Just Good Old Rock and Roll was the first Electric Prunes album almost entirely written and performed by the band members, signaling what could have been a new era of artistic autonomy had the album been greeted more warmly by the record-buying public. While the record received some critical praise at the time, its sales were middling, and this would be the final Electric Prunes studio album until another lineup (with members from prior versions of the band) released Artifact decades later, in 2001. In 2006, Collectors' Choice Music reissued Just Good Old Rock and Roll on CD."

  "text" : "Jesus of Cool is the 1978 solo debut album by British singer-songwriter Nick Lowe who left Brinsley Schwarz in 1974. Produced by Lowe, it was released in March 1978 by Radar Records in the UK. In the United States, the album was retitled Pure Pop for Now People, with Columbia Records replacing \"Shake and Pop\" with \"They Called It Rock\" (a Rockpile version of the same song, which had been included as a single-sided bonus 45 in the Radar album), swapping the live version of \"Heart of the City\" for the studio version that had been released as a single on Stiff Records (the other side of the single, \"So It Goes\", was included in both versions of the album), and adding \"Rollers Show\" from a pre-Stiff United Artists maxi-single. The songs are also in a different order than the UK version. The album has been highly acclaimed by critics. The album was reissued in an expanded, deluxe edition by Proper Records (in the UK) and Yep Roc Records (in the US) in February 2008. Two verses of \"So It Goes\" were included in the sound track to the 1979 film Rock 'n' Roll High School."

  "text" : "Just as I Am is the debut album by the first Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian. Given the relative popularity of Australian Idol in late 2003, BMG Australia subsequently contracted Sebastian for a record before Christmas 2003. He wanted to record a mixture of pop and R&B material. Guy Sebastian co-wrote three of the songs on the album \"All I Need Is You\", \"I 4 U\" and \"Something Don't Feel Right\". He says on his web page: \"I think the credibility in having your own stuff makes you as an artist. Credibility is what I've always strived for and I couldn't imagine my first record not having one of my songs on it.\" The album also features cover versions of \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong, \"Can You Stand the Rain\" by New Edition and \"When Doves Cry\" by Prince."

All were prominent members of New York City's short-lived No Wave music scene. The opera is a loose retelling of Mozart's opera Don Giovanni, which in turn is based on the legend of Don Juan. The title character is a libidinous figure endowed with magical powers, and the songs of the opera follow him on a series of adventures, many of them involving the pursuit of various females, including a female lion, a young girl, and a grandmother \"in the beautiful autumn of life.\""

  "text" : "Jupiters Darling is the thirteenth studio album by the American rock band Heart, released in 2004 through the label Sovereign Artists. Sovereign Artist's Marketing Director, Paul Angles, simultaneously released their album via file sharing networks, which were included in an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court. Two promo singles were released simultaneously with the album: \"The Oldest Story in the World\" and \"The Perfect Goodbye\". Heart performed the song \"The Perfect Goodbye\" with country star Wynonna Judd on CMT's Crossroads in the summer of 2004. This album marked a return to Heart's hard rock and folk rock roots; however, it managed to sell only roughly 175,000 copies and peaked at number 94 on the U.S. Billboard 200. Since then the Sovereign Artists record company closed and stopped doing business. It has been reported (via band sources on www.heart-music.com) that Sovereign still owes Heart thousands of dollars. The album cover bears an image of the Mandelbrot set, rotated so the main cardioid is oriented the same way a heart would normally be, with the cusp at top. The album cover art is seen briefly in the 2005 film Elizabethtown, for which Nancy Wilson did soundtrack music, and at the time was married to the film's director/screenwriter Cameron Crowe."

It enjoyed a seven-week run at #1 on Billboard's R&B albums chart and also reached #23 on Billboard's main album chart. It was hailed as a comeback album, given that it provided Aretha with her first Gold-certified disc and Top 40 song since Sparkle in 1976. This album is currently out of print. The title track, \"Jump To It\", was Aretha's first Pop Top 40 hit since 1976 and her first #1 R&B hit since 1977's \"Break It To Me Gently\". The infectious song was nominated for a Grammy Award. The album itself received an American Music Award for Best Soul Album. (*Over 500,000 copies sold in the United States) In 2005, Patrick Alavi released \"Come To Me\" which used a Sample of \"Jump To It\"."

  "text" : "Jazz Impressions of New York is a jazz album released by Dave Brubeck. It developed out of Brubeck's association with the CBS television show Mr. Broadway starring Craig Stevens. Brubeck's theme music was written to convey the \"urbane personality\" of the main character, yet be \"a signature immediately recognizable as Brubeck.\" The tune has the urgent, polyrhythmic feel of many of Brubeck's other adventures in 3/4 time. Other themes were developed from this waltz-time concept, as well as from specific program-related needs. The personnel is the \"classic\" Quartet: Paul Desmond on alto saxophone, Eugene Wright on acoustic bass, and Joe Morello on drums. However, there are some unexpected (and amusing) changes and additions on the final track, Upstage Rumba, as Brubeck explains: \"The Quartet version of this piece actually evolved in the studio when each person upstaged the other by unexpectedly doing something quite out of character. Paul Desmond surprised us first by making his debut on a bass marimba which had been left in the studio from a Latin band session. Then, people came running out of the control booth and, in quite an uncontrollable manner, grabbed the nearest percussion instrument and began to play. My brother Howard was shaking some sort of cylindrical drum with BBs in it; John Lee, a drummer friend of Joe Morello, played on Joe's tom-tom; and Teo Macero, our producer, was master of the claves until he dropped them at the end of the piece (which I consider a final stroke of upstage chicanery).\""

  "text" : "Judy at Carnegie Hall is a two-record live recording of a concert by Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall in New York, complete with backing orchestra led by Mort Lindsey. This concert appearance, on the night of Sunday April 23, 1961, has been called \"the greatest night in show business history\". Garland's live performances were big successes at the time and her record company wanted to capture that energy onto a recording. The double album became a hit, both critically and commercially. The album also won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making Garland the first woman to win the award. Judy Garland's career had moved from movies in the 1940s, to vaudeville and elaborate stage shows in the 1950s. She also suffered from extreme drug and alcohol abuse, and, by 1959, had become overweight and ill and needed extensive medical treatment. After a long convalescence, weight loss, and vocal rest, she returned in 1960 to the concert stage with a simple program of 'just Judy.' Garland's 1960-1961 tour of Europe and North America was a success, and her stage presence was highly regarded. Eventually Judy was billed as \"The World's Greatest Entertainer\". Audiences were documented as leaving their seats and crowding around the stage to be closer to Garland, and often called her back for encore after encore, even asking her to repeat a song after her book of arrangements was completed."

They beat down the restrictive walls of what can go onto a hardcore record with the inclusion of piano études and acoustic guitar solos.\""

  "text" : "Jacket Full of Danger is Adam Green's fourth solo album, released in 2006. It revisits the string-laden melodrama of his second album Friends of Mine, mostly abandoning the uptempo country folk sound of his previous release, Gemstones. Lyrically, the album explores the same mournful terrain as Gemstones with Green's familiar obsession with drugs, surrealism and failed relationships. The album's cover art is an illustrated photograph by American artist Galen Pehrson and was featured in ArtForum 10.6Vol-9UK The image depicts Green with a suite of illustrated characters, each character refers or symbolizes a social theorist, philosopher, or semiotician: Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Louis Althusser, and most notable Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan engaged in a \"dance\". In the UK, the album was preceded by the single Nat King Cole which also features artwork by Pehrson."

  "text" : "J and Friends Sing And Chant For Amma is an album-length compact disc by American guitarist/singer/songwriter and Dinosaur Jr bandleader J Mascis. The CD consists of several devotional songs composed and/or adapted by Mascis and dedicated to Hindu religious leader Mata Amritanandamayi, or Ammachi, of whom Mascis is a devoted follower. Recorded during a banner year for the alternative icon, Sing and Chant For Amma was self-released by Mascis on his own Baked Goods label during a break in the Dinosaur Jr reunion tour. Although there are no production or studio credits on the album, the CD is presumed to have been produced by Mascis and recorded at his own Bob's Place Studio in Amherst, Massachusetts. The proceeds from the album are being donated to Tsunami relief and other efforts Ammachi's organization is spearheading. Mascis had previously written the song \"Ammaring\" about Ammachi, and recorded it on the first J Mascis and the Fog album More Light."

  "text" : "Jane Doe is the fourth studio album by American metalcore band Converge, released September 4, 2001 through Equal Vision Records, this is their last release on the label. The album was received with immediate critical acclaim, with critics praising its poetic lyrics, dynamic range, ferocity and production. The album was also a commercial success in comparison to Converge's previous outings, and both the band and the album have developed a cult following since its release. The cover art has become an icon of Converge as well as the underground metalcore scene. It is the band's first album to feature Nate Newton and Ben Koller, and the last to feature Aaron Dalbec, resulting in the line-up that has remained to this day. Guitarist Kurt Ballou cites Fugazi, The Jesus Lizard and Hoover as influences on the album."

  "text" : "Jewelz is the second album by the rapper O.C.. Unlike his debut, 1994's Word...Life, Jewelz features a wider number of guest producers and rappers. Producer DJ Premier (who also oversaw and mixed other parts of the album) lends his hand on four songs, while Buckwild, Da Beatminerz and O.Gee all drop three songs each. D.I.T.C. members Showbiz and Lord Finesse each contribute one number and as the album was released the production was highly praised for its clean, crispy but at the same time dark and menacing sound. O.C. plays with a wide array of styles on the album, from the war-metaphor battle song \"War Games\" to abstract stories on the haunting \"The Crow\" and a very special history on a mystique woman that enters Credles life in \"Stronjay\". Though the differences between O.C.'s two first efforts are very noticeable many fans are constantly, and still, arguing which was the better album out of them. This album, like his first, received strong reviews, but lacked in sales. He made his first appearance on the Billboard 200 album chart with the album, and also made his first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, with the single \"Far From Yours\". The album is now out of print. As part of the concept for Jewelz, the CD was sold with different colored disc art inspired by the color palate of various jewels."

  "text" : "Note: the first cover is of the first CD issue of the album, released during the 1990s. Javanese Court Gamelan is a recording of the gamelan of the Paku Alaman court in Yogyakarta, Java, Indonesia. It was recorded by ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown. It was issued on compact disc on April 17, 1991 with the original contents. It was remastered and reissued under the name Java: Court Gamelan on January 28, 2003 with a cover of a photograph of Borobudur. The gamelan in the recording is an heirloom gamelan, made in 1755 for Paku Alam I. The sléndro half, named Kyai Pengawé Sari (\"Sir Invitation to Beauty\"), is heard on tracks 1 and 3, while the pélog half, named Kyai Telaga Muntjar (\"Sir Lake and Fountain\"), is heard on tracks 2 and 4. The recording was made on January 10, 1971, in the reception hall of the Pura Paku Alaman, by permission of Paku Alam VIII, for a radio broadcast in honor of his birthday. The sounds of sparrows that make their nests in the hall and other ambient noises are considered normal. The recording of Puspawarna was included on the Voyager Golden Record. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording in the Grammy Awards of 1972."

  "text" : "Just One Night is the fourth album by British model-turned-singer Samantha Fox. For this 1991 release, she once again enlisted longtime collaborators Full Force as producers on several tracks, and also worked with Robert Clivillés and David Cole of C+C Music Factory. The album continued Samantha Fox's experimentation with early 1990s house, hip-hop, dance and freestyle music. The first single, \"(Hurt Me, Hurt Me) But the Pants Stay On\" had some radio airplay but failed to receive much attention. The album's second single, \"Another Woman (Too Many People)\", remixed for radio, charted moderately in some Continental European countries. The radio remix of \"Another Woman (Too Many People)\", along with the third single, \"Just One Night\", and fourth single, \"Spirit Of America\", featuring a guitar solo by Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest, were subsequently included in the track listing for her 1992 \"Greatest Hits\" release. The album was reissued in 2012 as a double-cd special edition by Cherry Red Records in the U.K., with additional bonus tracks and remixes."

The single \"Just Another Day in Paradise\" was not as big a hit as \"Key Largo\" but received much airplay and also hit the Country charts as well. In Asia, the other international hit \"Casablanca\" was generated from the album. The song was recorded by Japanese singer Hiromi Go in same year, and its cover version reached #2 on the Japanese chart, finally selling more than 500,000 copies. Likewise, this album that featured the original version of \"Casablanca\" achieved commercial success, and finally it became the second best-selling album of 1982 by a Western artist on that country's official hit parade, Oricon."

  "text" : "Joe Cocker! is Joe Cocker's second studio album, released in November 1969. Following the template of his first LP, this album features numerous covers of songs originally performed by Bob Dylan (\"Dear Landlord\"), The Beatles (\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\" and \"Something\" - both released almost simultaneously with original versions; \"Let It Be\" was also recorded and released as a B-side), Leonard Cohen (\"Bird on the Wire\"), and future touring partner Leon Russell (\"Delta Lady\"). Cocker also co-wrote one song, \"That's Your Business Now\", Chris Stainton, who was also his writing partner in later years. Cocker is backed by the Grease Band, who appeared on his first album and backed the singer at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969. However, Cocker would part ways with the group following the release of this record, citing a reluctance to tour. However, the need to meet live commitments in America prompted Cocker to organise a new band (the Mad Dogs and Englishmen) with the help of keyboardist Leon Russell, heralding a new musical direction for the singer on his subsequent studio releases. The album charted in the UK in May 1972 at #29 when it was re-released as a double pack with Cocker's first LP With A Little Help From My Friends. On its release, the album also charted at #11 on the Billboard 200 in America, propelled by Cocker's well-received appearance with the Grease Band at Woodstock earlier in the year."

The album reached #36 on the country charts, while the only released single, \"The Night Hank Williams Came to Town\", peaked at #43. \"Ballad of Barbara\" is a rerecording of a track that had been a hit single for Cash in the early 1970s.

  "text" : "Johnny 99 is the 69th album by American country singer Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in 1983. It is notable for including two covers of Bruce Springsteen songs, \"Highway Patrolman\" and \"Johnny 99\". \"I'm Ragged But I'm Right,\" a George Jones song, was a minor hit, reaching No. 75. Johnny 99 is generally regarded as a strong release at a point in Cash's career which is considered to be the least successful; it was also the second-to-last solo album released by Cash on Columbia, prior to his move to Mercury Records. Hoyt Axton sings background on \"Highway Patrolman\" and \"Joshua Gone Barbados\". \"New Cut Road\" had been a relatively successful single for Bobby Bare in 1981; Paul Kennerley's \"Brand New Dance\" would go on to be covered, among others, by Emmylou Harris on her 1990 album of the same name. Several of the songs on Johnny 99 contain political or social themes and commentary: the title track tells the story of a disgruntled former automobile plant employee who turns to crime after encountering serious financial difficulties; \"God Bless Robert E. Lee\" praises the Confederacy's most famous general for managing to prevent unnecessary loss of human life in the war-torn South by surrendering to the Union at Appomattox Court House; \"Joshua Gone Barbados\" deals with a sugarcane-cutters' strike on Saint Vincent turned violent; \"Highway Patrolman\", in turn, discusses a troubled relationship between the title character and his alcoholic, violent brother."

  "text" : "Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive is a 1981 album by Joe Jackson. It is a collection of covers of classic 1940's swing and jump blues songs originally performed by musicians such as Louis Jordan and Cab Calloway, the latter of whom's song \"Jumpin' Jive\" was the eponym for this album. The album and single were credited to Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive. Jackson's foray through jump blues anticipated the so-called \"retro-swing revival\" (Squirrel Nut Zippers, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Brian Setzer Orchestra) by a full fifteen years. A remastered edition was released in late 1998."

  "text" : "John Cougar (titled Miami in Australia) is the Gold-selling fourth album, third album released, by John Mellencamp. This was the first album with his new record company Riva Records and under the name \"John Cougar.\" Released in 1979, following the Australian success of \"I Need a Lover\" from the previous year's A Biography (which did not receive a U.S. release), the album included the aforementioned track for U.S. audiences, as well as a re-working of A Biography's \"Taxi Dancer.\" \"I Need a Lover,\" upon the release of this album, became a Top 40 hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 28 in December 1979, after having been a No. 5 hit in Australia in 1978 when it was released as a single from A Biography. \"Miami\" was also a hit single in Australia and became his second Top 40 hit in that country. \"I Need a Lover\" was subsequently covered by Pat Benatar on her album In the Heat of the Night. In the U.S., however, \"Small Paradise\" was released as a single in place of \"Miami,\" but it was not very successful, peaking at No. 87 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1980. During concerts to promote the album, guitarist Mike Wanchic would trade lead vocals with Mellencamp on \"Miami.\" Mellencamp recorded a solo acoustic rendition of \"Sugar Marie\" for his 2010 box set On the Rural Route 7609, stating in the set's liner notes: \"'Sugar Marie' suffered from young musicians not knowing how to present the music. I've always had an affection for the song, and I've always known it had something I didn't get at on the album.\""

Nevertheless, he kept control over the recording process, with only Kim Osterwalder helping out on cello. The song \"One Less Star\" appeared in Above the Below, a 2003-documentary about a stunt by David Blaine. \"Chosen One\" was covered live by The Flaming Lips in a record store in Minneapolis on December 12, 1993, a recording which later appeared on their EP Due to High Expectations... the Flaming Lips Are Providing Needles for Your Balloons. The song also appeared (as a Peel Session) on Callahan's rarities compilation Accumulation: None in 2002. The song \"37 Push Ups\" appeared in the record company Kill Rock Stars' compilation album, Rock Stars Kill."

  "text" : "Jeremy Spencer is an album by British blues rock musician Jeremy Spencer, who was a member of Fleetwood Mac from 1967–71. Released on 23 January 1970, this was his first solo album and the first solo album by a current member of Fleetwood Mac. The album consisted of a collection of blues and 1950s songs, many of them parodies of other artists or styles. Spencer had already proved his powers of mimicry on the first two Fleetwood Mac albums, and he used this solo project to extend this to other forms of music, such as surf pop on \"Surfin' Girl\". Other artists that came in for the Spencer treatment were Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley. Accompanying Spencer on the album were the other members of Fleetwood Mac, although Peter Green was only present on one track, \"String-a-long\". This album can be seen as making up for Spencer's absence on the previous Fleetwood Mac album Then Play On. On 17 October 1970, \"Linda\" was released as a single, with the non-album \"Teenage Darling\" on the B-side, composed by Spencer. During 1970 Fleetwood Mac concerts, Jeremy appeared on stage dressed as Elvis Presley, performing \"Teenage Darling\", with Peter Green on lead guitar."

  "text" : "Johnny & June is a compilation album and 60th overall album by American country singer Johnny Cash, released on Bear Family Records in 1978 (see 1978 in music). Like The Unissued Johnny Cash it consists of material that was either unreleased or not widely available. Most of the songs were recorded from 1964 to 1965, with the exception of \"Smiling Bill McCall\" from 1960. That song, \"Cotton Picking Hands\" and \"Wer Kennt Den Weg\" and \"In Virginia\" (both in German) had been previously released on singles. \"Thunderball\" was recorded for the James Bond film, but was ultimately turned down in favor of Tom Jones (see also the Thunderball film and soundtrack articles). \"One Too Many Mornings\" is a Bob Dylan song from The Times They Are a-Changin'. Cash and Dylan would later (unsuccessfully) attempt a duet version of the song for Nashville Skyline, and Cash would record the song again for Heroes with Waylon Jennings. This version features Maybelle Carter playing autoharp. The Carters feature on several songs on the album; June Carter sings lead vocal on three songs and duets on another, and Anita Carter sings on \"That's What It's Like to Be Lonesome.\""

The Justice League was conceived by writer Gardner Fox, and first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #28 (March 1960). The team is an assemblage of superheroes who join together as the Justice League. The seven original members were Batman, Aquaman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The team roster has rotated throughout the years, consisting of many superheroes from the DC Universe. The Justice League received its own comic book title called Justice League of America in November 1960. With the 2011 relaunch of its titles, DC Comics released a second volume of Justice League. In July 2016, the DC Rebirth initiative relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of Justice League. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various television programs and video games and is set to appear in the 2017 film of the same name."

Its hit single \"Pump It Up\" was featured in 2 Fast 2 Furious, You Got Served and Madden NFL 2004, and reached at number 38 in the United States and number 13 in the United Kingdom. \"Focus\" was featured in Def Jam Vendetta. The album's second single, \"Fire (Yes, Yes Y'all)\" was released on July 15, 2003, and the song was featured in the movie Mean Girls. \"Walk With Me\" was featured as the ending song for Def Jam: Fight for NY.

  "text" : "Judith is American singer and songwriter Judy Collins' 12th studio album, released in 1975 by Elektra Records in both stereo (7E-1032) and CD-4 quadraphonic (EQ-1032) versions. It peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and is her best-selling studio album to date, achieving Platinum status in the mid 1990s. Collins received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for her cover of Stephen Sondheim's \"Send in the Clowns\". Sondheim won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year that same year, based on the popularity of Collins' performance of the song on this album. The single peaked at No. 36 on Billboard's Pop singles chart in 1975, and then reentered the chart in 1977, reaching No. 19; it spent a total of 27 non-consecutive weeks on this chart. The album also includes material by Steve Goodman, Danny O'Keefe, Wendy Waldman, Jimmy Webb, the Rolling Stones, and the 1930s standard \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\", as well as three of Collins' own compositions- \"Houses\", \"Song for Duke\", and \"Born to the Breed\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1975, for sales of over 500,000 copes. It was later certified Platinum in 1996, for sales of over 1,000,000 copes."

  "text" : "Jackie Brown is a 1997 American crime thriller film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film, Tarantino's third feature-length production, is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1992 novel Rum Punch. It is the first (and to date, only) film that Tarantino has adapted from a previous work, and stars Pam Grier in the title role. The film pays homage to 1970s blaxploitation films, particularly the films Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974), both of which also starred Grier in the title roles. The film's supporting cast includes Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget Fonda, and Michael Keaton. It was Tarantino's third film following Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994). Grier and Forster were both veteran actors but neither had performed a leading role in many years. Jackie Brown revitalized both actors' careers. The film garnered Forster an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and Golden Globe Award nominations for Jackson and Grier."

It starred Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones (in her first recording role), Fish, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and others. It was also the first Jeff Wayne release that is not related to his musical adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Based on a story outline by Jeff Wayne, the script was written by writer Brian Sibley and playwright John Spurling with Sibley responsible for the script of 'Animal & Man', 'The Eagle & the Hawk' and 'The Appian Way' and Spurling largely responsible for the script of 'The Parting of the Ways' and 'The Last Battle'. Also starring in the album is Chris Thompson and Jo Partridge, who appeared in The War of the Worlds. Originally, Thompson had a singing role, but his song was dropped from the final version of the album. It is rumoured that Thompson possesses the only copy of his song. The artists for the album were Gino D'Achille, Christos Achilleos and Andrew Wheatcroft, art directed by Richard Evans"

  "text" : "Jukin' is the debut album recorded by The Manhattan Transfer. Released on Capitol Records in 1971, it was also the only album released by the first incarnation of the group which consisted of founder Tim Hauser, Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, Gene Pistilli, and Pat Rosalia. The album was later reissued in the UK by EMI's Music for Pleasure under the title The Manhattan Transfer and Gene Pistilli  Pistilli had been best known for his performing and songwriting collaborations with Terry Cashman and Tommy West. The group line-up endured only about two years. According to Tim Hauser, \"Gene and I were in two different places. He was more into country & western, R&B, and the Memphis sound, and by then I'd become more interested in jazz and swing...\" Consequently, this edition of the Manhattan Transfer broke up shortly after this album was released, and Tim Hauser formed a new version of the group during October 1972. The revised Manhattan Transfer line-up would sign to Atlantic Records in 1975 and resume the group's recording career with much greater success. The Jukin' album, meanwhile, remains an orphan in the Manhattan Transfer's catalogue. Issued on a different label than their future successes, with a different group line-up and a different sound from that which became their trademark, Jukin' is not acknowledged at all on the band's official website, nor have any of its tracks been anthologized on Manhattan Transfer 'best-of' compilations. The revised line-up would re-record the track \"Java Jive\" on the group's next album. It is the re-recorded version, not the version found on Jukin', that can be found on multiple compilation albums. The album has been reissued, usually as a budget-priced item, with a variety of covers. A comparatively recent European re-issue of Jukin' tracks was entitled A Touch Of Class, and featured misleading packaging and credits that wrongly implied that the songs were actually performed by the later (post-1972) version of The Manhattan Transfer."

  "text" : "Jewels For Sophia is the thirteenth studio album by Robyn Hitchcock, released on Warner Records in 1999. Since Respect (1993), the hitherto prolific Hitchcock had released just one full studio album (Moss Elixir in 1996), the rest of his recent output consisting largely of repackages and live recordings. Jewels For Sophia however contained a dozen tracks, only one of which (\"No, I Don't Remember Guildford\") had been recorded previously, and two extras not listed on the cover, and hidden away after a substantial pause following the album's \"last\" track. Tracks include a paean to cheese in all its forms, with a sub-text of the global power struggle, and the quasi-nonsensical title number, whose lyric is rather pointed, in similar vein to John Lennon's \"I Am the Walrus\". The two hidden extras are \"Mr. Tongs\" and \"Don't Talk to Me About Gene Hackman\"."

The film, produced by Dhillin Mehta under Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd, stars Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor in their fourth film together with Dara Singh, Pavan Malhotra and Saumya Tandon in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a feisty Punjabi girl who is sent off track when she bumps into a depressed Mumbai businessman on an overnight train to Delhi. While attempting to get him back on board when he alights at a station stop, both are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Having walked out of his corporate business after being dumped by his girlfriend, the man has no destination in mind, until the girl forces him to accompany her back home and then on to elope with her secret boyfriend. Released in the United Kingdom a day before its worldwide release of 26 October 2007, the film became a hit at the Indian box office as well as overseas. The distributors of the film, Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd, announced that Jab We Met would be remade by corporate entity Moser Baer in four other Indian languages: Tamil (dubbed into Telugu), Kannada and Malayalam. The film remains as one of the best romantic movies in bollywood."

Although the reissued CD doesn't credit Ely's backing musicians, the original LP included a one-page insert containing lyrics and musician credits. The core of the backing band that Ely had assembled for his debut was the same Lubbock-based crack team that appeared with him the following year on Honky Tonk Masquerade and continued to follow him on the road until 1982. Years later Ely would recall that the band had not initially made plans for a recording career: \"We had recorded some songs at [Don] Caldwell's studio,\" Ely said. \"Don took that tape to Jerry Jeff Walker, and Jerry Jeff recorded one of the songs and played it for a guy with MCA Records. Then one night in 1975 at the Cotton Club, an A&R guy with MCA asked, 'Do y'all want to make some records?'\"\"I told him we'd sure never planned on it. But we hadn't planned anything else either, so why not?\""

  "text" : "Joy of a Toy is the debut solo album of Kevin Ayers, a founding member of Soft Machine. Its whimsical and unique vision is a clear indication of how Soft Machine might have progressed under Ayers' tenure. He is accompanied on the LP by his Soft Machine colleagues Robert Wyatt, Mike Ratledge and Hugh Hopper. After a Soft Machine tour of the USA with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Ayers had decided to retire from the music business. Hendrix however, presented Ayers with an acoustic Gibson J-200 guitar on the promise that he continue his songwriting. Ayers repaired to a small London flat where he composed and arranged a whole LP which was then presented to Malcolm Jones' fledgling Harvest label where it was recorded by Peter Jenner for the then exorbitant sum of £4000. Joy features many of Ayers' most enduring songs from \"The Lady Rachel\" to \"Girl on a Swing\", the latter still, regularly covered by artists to this day like Candie Payne and The Ladybug Transistor. It was on Joy that Ayers developed his sonorous vocal delivery, an avant-garde song construction and an affection for bizarre instrumentation that would have a deep influence far into the 1970s and indeed the present day. For the recording of Syd Barrett's first solo album—The Madcap Laughs—Soft Machine was brought in to do overdubs for a few of Barrett's tracks. It was during this time, Barrett did guitar for Ayers on his track \"Religious Experience\", (later titled \"Singing a Song in the Morning\") this version wasn't released until the 2003 reissue of Joy."

The LP originally appeared on Tom Wilson's short-lived Transition Records. In the mid-1960s it was purchased (along with much of the Transition catalog) by Delmark Records owner Bob Koester, finally being reissued in 1967. When originally released, it came with an extensive booklet featuring words and photos of Sun Ra and his Arkestra. The LP featured original compositions by Sun Ra along with one by Arkestral bassist Richard Evans. Another composition by Arkestra member Julian Priester has been included in reissues from the session, and additional unreleased tracks (all Ra originals) are known to survive. The single non-Arkestral composition was Possession, by Harry Revel, which had been written for Les Baxter's album Perfume Set to Music; Possession was arranged for the Arkestra by the Texan pianist and composer Prince Shell. Earlier home recordings by Ra, including one dating from 1948 or 1949, were released with tracks from 1973 on the album Deep Purple."

The band recorded the album after receiving a record contract in the mail from Austrian label Lethal Records and was released by that company in October 1993. During the recording of the first track \"Abstraction\", vocalist Adam Agius damaged his voice, thus resulting in the raw vocal sound on the rest of the album. The name \"Jar of Kingdom\" was inspired by a comment by television personality and entertainer Graham Kennedy during a comedy skit, in which he described a vial of pig semen as a \"jar of kingdom\". Jar of Kingdom featured early experiments with synthesisers, acoustic guitars and samples: \"Whale\" includes the sample of a humpback whale song. All tracks from this album except \"Wandering and Wondering\" and \"Whale\" later appeared on the Embryonics compilation. The album was dedicated to the memory of John Munns and David Carter."

It is said that \"it became apparent to them that they had nothing in common with the rappers of Los Angeles and that U.S. rappers were speaking of a real environment containing elements totally foreign to the essentially middle-class world of the vier.\" Throughout the 24 tracks on Jetzt geht's ab!, Die Fantastischen Vier express their views on personal relationships and intimacy, rather than focusing solely on social problems and political discourse, allowing them to \"communicate strong emotions and shared experiences into the German sphere by shifting its subject matter.\""

  "text" : "Joe Satriani is a self-titled EP by guitarist Joe Satriani, released in 1984. Originally self-released in a limited run on vinyl only, the majority of the EP was later reissued on the first disc of Satriani's 1993 studio album, Time Machine, with the exception of \"Talk to Me\", which was not included due its master tape having been damaged. The EP is notable for only using sounds made by an electric guitar, from tapping on the pickups for drums, to detuning the guitar for bass. The album was recorded in Jeff Holt's basement studio while Satriani was a guitar teacher in Berkeley, California and a member of a band called The Squares. The EP was reviewed by Guitar Player magazine which had no knowledge that Satriani was ever in a typical band. The review, which treated Satriani as a purely instrumental guitarist, inspired him to pursue instrumental guitar playing as a career. However, the EP was not sufficient to secure a recording contract. Satriani used a credit card to finance his first full album, Not of This Earth, and used that finished album to secure a distribution contract with Relativity Records."

  "text" : "Junkyard Hearts is a set of 4 EPs released independently by Joseph Arthur in 2002 to coincide with his first headline tour in the UK. The EPs were released on special edition CD and collectors' edition 12\" vinyl (with each 12\" sleeve illustrated by Joseph Arthur himself). The EPs were only made available on the tour and are thus now hard to find. The set preceded his third studio album Redemption's Son. The songs \"Dear Lord,\" \"The Termite Song,\" \"Favorite Girl,\" and \"Voices Will Fight\" (later renamed \"In the Night\") appear on the album Redemption's Son. The version of \"Dear Lord\" on EP II features a longer outro than the version of the song found on Redemption's Son. Real World Records reissued the four EPs onto a double CD set in July 2012, as a part of their Real World Gold series."

  "text" : "Jasper County is the tenth studio album by country singer Trisha Yearwood. It was Yearwood's first studio album in four years since 2001's Inside Out. Yearwood took a four-year break from recording after 2001 mainly because she began a relationship with Garth Brooks (whom she would later marry) and creative time. It was given a positive review by Allmusic, who called the album \"one of her very best records.\" The album reached number 1 on the Billboard country albums chart. It was also her highest peak on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 4. Her final album for MCA Nashville, it produced the singles \"Georgia Rain\" and \"Trying to Love You\", which peaked at number 15 and number 52, respectively, on the Hot Country Songs charts; the latter was also a number 28 hit on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts. Later presses of the album also included \"Love Will Always Win\", a number 23-peaking duet with her husband, Garth Brooks, which was also on Brooks's 2006 The Lost Sessions album. The track \"Who Invented the Wheel\" was originally recorded by Anthony Smith on his debut album If That Ain't Country."

  "text" : "Just Roll Tape: April 26, 1968 is a Stephen Stills demo album released in 2007. In the sleeve notes to the CD, Stephen Stills recalls that he was present at a Judy Collins session in New York in 1968, and when she finished with studio time remaining, Stills paid the engineer privately to let him record song demos. But Stills left the tapes in the studio and eventually considered them lost. When the studio was about to close in 1978, musician Joe Colasurdo, who was rehearsing there, was told by the owner that he could take away any tapes he wanted to before they cleared the place out. After seeing Stills' names on several of the boxes, Colasurdo kept them safe until he could find a reel-to-reel machine to play them on. Colasurdo began attempting to get the masters safely back into Stills's hands, an undertaking that took 25 years. In 2003, he was connected to Graham Nash after happening to meet a close friend of his named Dan Curland, who owns the Mystic Disc Record Store. Nash received the tapes, passed them on to Stills, encouraging him to release them. Stills is the only musician on the album. He sings all the songs and plays acoustic guitar and dobro. \"Treetop Flyer\" is not from the 1968 sessions. Note that the April 26, 1968 date cited in the album's title is not correct, as Stills was performing at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, AZ on that date as a member of Buffalo Springfield."

In a further move from his previous jazz fusion stylings, Beck adopts a more straightforward instrumental rock approach on Guitar Shop, save for two tracks (\"Guitar Shop\" and \"Day in the House\") on which drummer Terry Bozzio provides quirky spoken vocals."

All songs were Phillips originals, dealing mostly with recent events in Phillips' life, including references to his new girlfriend Geneviève Waïte and longtime friend Ann Marshall (\"April Anne\"). The backing musicians included members of Wrecking Crew. Today the album receives favorable reviews from fans and critics alike. The album was selected as one of ShortList's 50 Coolest Albums Ever. As Phillips was the backing singer in the Mamas and the Papas, with the other three serving as lead singers, the album mix tends to de-emphasize his lead vocals. Denny Doherty stated that, had the Mamas & the Papas performed this album, it would have been one of their finest, because of the strength of Phillips' songs. The single \"Mississippi\" reached the US Billboard top 40. Phillips and the other members of the Mamas & the Papas were threatened with a lawsuit just as the album was released, discouraging the label from promoting the album. In 2006, the album was reissued by Varèse Sarabande with eight bonus tracks, also mostly Phillips originals."

Though formally divided into 13 tracks, the entire album consists of a single continuous piece of music, with some musical themes which are repeated throughout the work. Because of its narrative nature, it has been called a rock opera and/or dense concept album. The story follows an astronaut who, while on a voyage to Saturn, encounters aliens who take him to their galaxy, where he is suffused with knowledge and wisdom. It is usually interpreted as a commentary on the nuclear arms race."

The album has a bonus-EP with three songs about Die Ärzte and a hidden track. This is the first album after Debil that Die Ärzte produced alone. The cover is a reference to the most consumed food during their studio sessions - pizza. The whole packaging looks like a pizza box; the CD itself has a picture of a pizza on it and the bonus EP on their website is accessible using a code printed on paper in the shape of a green pepper. The EP looks like a tomato slice. The album has been criticized for not being as funny as one would expect from Die Ärzte, although it was very warmly received by fans.."

  "text" : "Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets is a collaborative studio album from Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets. It was released on 1 November 2004, peaking at number 28 on the ARIA albums chart and number 2 on the AIR independent charts, additionally achieving platinum status. The album consists of twelve full songs and eight beatboxing skits. It is best described as hip-hop fused with a mixture of rock, pop, R&B, funk, soul and jazz. The music generally consists of Turner’s vocal percussion and guitar, with the Modern Day Poets (Turner’s brother and cousin) providing the rap. Many of the tracks pertain to real-life issues. Guest artists on the album include Australian Idol contestants Axle Whitehead and Rebekah LaVauney. Hence, the song \"Scatbox\" is a combination of Whitehead’s scatting and Turner's beatboxing, while LaVauney performs vocals on the track \"Behind Bars\", a song she wrote about a partner's incarceration. In addition, boxer Anthony Mundine is heard rapping on the album's second single \"Knock U Out\", and former CDB singer Gary Pinto provides backing vocals on the song \"Lady\". The album was well received by critics and spawned four successful singles. It was also nominated for Best Urban Release and Best Independent Release at the 2005 ARIA Awards."

  "text" : "Jardin Au Fou is the second solo album by German keyboardist Hans-Joachim Roedelius, best known for his work with Cluster. The title is French for \"Garden of Madness\". Jardin Au Fou was recorded from April through July, 1978 at Paragon Studios in Berlin, Germany. It was produced by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann and released by the French label Egg in 1979. Jardin Au Fou was the only early Roedelius album not to be released by Sky Records. The original release included 10 tracks but the final short piece, \"Final\", was left off the track listing on the original album cover. Jardin Au Fou was reissued on CD in 1998 by the Japanese Captain Trip label. The reissued version added six bonus tracks which nearly doubled the length of the album. Three of the new tracks are remixes of material on the original recording while three others are newly released. The new tracks are very much in the style of the original album. The remixes, remastering of the original material, and production of the reissue is credited to Eric Spitzer-Martin and was done at The Hitbox in Altenburg, Austria. Mike Ezzo, who reviewed the album for Groove Unlimited, writes, in part: \"...'Jardin au Fou' was where he cemented that particularly light-hearted and wistful Roedelius sound. Not a garden of madness, rather a garden of whimsy and odd delight, it is simple melodious keyboard music whose character is imbued with unexpected chord progressions that don't resolve in traditional ways, a naive rhythmic sense, and melodic lines that go where you least expect. One gets the feeling that Roedelius had envisioned the scenery of a park on a Sunday afternoon in Paris, or some kind of music from a traveling circus show, when the inspiration for this recording struck him.\" Jardin Au Fou was the first of a series of albums where Roedelius ventured firmly into ambient or new age music. The French record label Jardin Au Fou named themselves after the Roedelius album."

  "text" : "Jefferson Airplane Loves You is a three-CD boxed set of recordings by the San Francisco rock band Jefferson Airplane with extensive liner notes by Jeff Tamarkin, author of the Jefferson Airplane history Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane. Many of the tracks are previously unreleased live recordings or studio rehearsals, but several are lifted from prior Jefferson Airplane albums. A song by The Great Society, Grace Slick's original band, appears on the first CD. A quadradisc version of the \"Volunteers\" album was released, and a few of the songs are from this release, but have been remixed into conventional stereo. Because of the remix, any psychedelic movements of instruments from front-to-back or side-to-side behind the listener that were present in the quadradisc version are lost. The quadradisc album used the discrete CD-4 system from JVC. The songs are arranged in chronological order beginning with a pre-Airplane solo by Marty Balin and ending with a 1972 live recording of the rarely heard \"You Wear Your Dresses Too Short\"."

  "text" : "Jazz in Silhouette is a jazz album by Sun Ra and His Arkestra. It was recorded on March 6, 1959 and released in May of the same year. The album was recorded in Chicago during a session that also included the whole of Sound Sun Pleasure!! and \"Interstellar Low Ways\" from the album of the same name. The album is considered to be one of Ra's best from his Chicago period before veering off into 'full-fledged explorations into the avant-garde'  that characterises the recordings made in New York in the 1960s. Jazz in Silhouette stands as an overlooked masterpiece, a work that shows Ra not as a mere curiosity or backwater galaxy, but as a major creative force in the jazz universe, a center of gravity around which many of jazz's major developments have orbited. This album simply inspires, no matter what perspective you adopt: rhythm, melody, ensemble or mood...Jazz in Silhouette shows Ra doing what he did like few others: looking at the past, present and future simultaneously while maintaining a unified musical direction...what results is a captivating set of music that not only firmly establishes Ra in the jazz tradition, but actually puts him on its leading edge, pointing the direction forward.— Mathew Wuethrich Recorded in 1959 at El Saturn Studio, Chicago, the album is one of three records that the Arkestra released in the 1950s, the other two being Jazz by Sun Ra and Super-Sonic Jazz. Originally released in a simple silk-screened cover credited to HP Corbissero, the album had gained its sci-fi cover, 'of half-naked women teleporting themselves over one of the moons of Saturn', credited to 'Evans'  by the early 1960s. The album was reissued by Impulse in 1974, and released on CD by Evidence in 1992. When originally released, the album's sides were reversed, starting with Hours After at the beginning of side one, and ending side two with Ancient Aiethopia. Enlightenment in particular was to become a staple of the Arkestra's concerts, often featuring chanted lyrics."

  "text" : "Jesus Christ Superstar or Jesus Christ Superstar – Original Australian Cast Recording is an album released in late 1972 on MCA Records. Jesus Christ Superstar is a rock opera created by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1970. The earliest Australian version was staged from May 1972 to February 1974. This album features Trevor White (as Jesus), Jon English (as Judas) and Michele Fawdon (as Mary Magdalene). Together with other cast members they performed vocals for a studio recording. It was produced by Patrick Flynn, the show's musical director and a conductor for Opera Australia. The album peaked at No. 17 on the Go-Set Albums Chart in June 1973, while it reached No. 13 on the Kent Music Report and remained on its charts for 54 weeks. It appeared in the top 100 on the 1974 End of Year Albums Chart. In May 1973, the album was awarded a gold record for sales worth $50,000. This stage production and resultant album featured a number of notable Australian musicians. Jon English became a popular entertainer both as an actor and singer. Fellow cast members, Mike Wade on guitar and Greg Henson on drums, were part of English's backing band. Stevie Wright (as Simon Zealotes) was a former member of The Easybeats and he formed a band, Black Tank, with fellow cast members Rory O'Donoghue (as Peter) on guitar and vocals and Ken Firth on bass guitar. Wright then pursued a successful solo career. O'Donoghe was also a TV personality (Thin Arthur) on Australian TV series, The Aunty Jack Show, and its spin-off, Wollongong the Brave. Firth and other musicians for the stage version, Phil Eizenberg on guitar and William \"Billy\" Miller on vocals, formed The Ferrets in 1975. Also on the soundtrack album were Levi Smith's Clefs' members Michael Carlos and Henson. Carlos, on organ and piano, was also the musical director of the backing band, The Superstars, for the stage show and album, alongside Henson, Wade (ex-Climax), Jamie McKinley on piano and Bruce Worral on bass guitar (ex-Sherbet). John Young (later styled as John Paul Young) who had the role of Annas became a successful solo artist and toured with various fellow cast members as his backing band, The Allstars. The cast recording from the 1992 production won the Aria for Highest Selling Album and nominated for Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album."

Unfortunately, the night that Garland recorded this album, she had a bad case of laryngitis and did not get to complete all of the wanted tracks for the album. She managed to finish 10 of the 13 scheduled songs that night. Capitol Records ended up not releasing this particular album due to her laryngitis, although there was a tentative plan for Judy to remake the LP in a recording studio. It was suggested by Steve Sanders in 1989 to release the album for the first time; Capitol made the decision to issue the album finally on June 20, 1989, with the title Judy Garland Live! The CD today is out of print, but has been included in Garland's Amsterdam Concert CD case as an extra bonus."

  "text" : "Jayne Mansfield (born Vera Jayne Palmer; April 19, 1933 – June 29, 1967) was an American actress in film, theatre, and television. Mansfield became a major Broadway star in 1955, a major Hollywood star in 1956, and a leading celebrity in 1957. She was also a nightclub entertainer, a singer, and one of the early Playboy Playmates. She was a major Hollywood sex symbol of the 1950s and early 1960s and 20th Century Fox's main sex symbol actress, alongside Marilyn Monroe. She was also known for her well-publicized personal life and publicity stunts, such as wardrobe malfunctions. While Mansfield's film career was short lived, she had several box-office successes and won a Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe. She enjoyed success in the role of fictional actress Rita Marlowe, both in the 1955–1956 Broadway version and the 1957 Hollywood film version of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. Her other major movie performances were for The Girl Can't Help It (1956), The Wayward Bus (1957), and Too Hot to Handle (1960). In the sexploitation film Promises! Promises! (1963), she became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood motion picture. Mansfield's professional name came from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. In 1967, Mansfield was killed in a car crash at the age of 34, along with two others."

The album was released on June 28, 1994, on Def Jam Recordings sub-label RAL Records, and was produced by Greg Nice, Smooth B., and Little Louie Vega. The album was only mildly successful, making it as high as #66 on the Billboard 200 and #13 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Two singles made it to the charts, \"Old to New\" and \"Return of the Hip-Hop Freaks.\" This would be the duo's last album on RAL, as it would leave the label after the failure of this album."

  "text" : "Just a Little Lovin' is the tenth studio album by Shelby Lynne, released in the United States and Canada on January 29, 2008. The album is a tribute to British singer Dusty Springfield, and features covers of nine songs popularized by her, in addition to \"Pretend\", an original song written by Lynne. Three of the covers are of songs from Springfield's debut album, while another four are of selections from Springfield's widely acclaimed fifth album, Dusty in Memphis. Lynne's tenth studio album is also her debut album for Lost Highway Records; the label released a promotional EP recorded in conjunction with radio station KCRW four days prior to the album. This album marks a return to Universal Music Group after Lynne released her previous two studio albums through Capitol Records. Though recorded at Capitol's Studio A in Los Angeles, California during January 2007, Lynne initially found her completed album without a distributing label amidst Capitol's merge with Virgin Records. Lynne told the Sydney Morning Herald in a January 25, 2008, interview, \"We cut the record the week Capitol Records busted up. So we're downstairs wondering why upstairs isn't coming down to check us out. Turns out there was no upstairs there.\" Outside the United States and Canada, the album is distributed by Mercury Records, the initial distributing label for her critical breakthrough album, I Am Shelby Lynne, when it was released in the United Kingdom prior to its American distribution."

The album was a critical and commercial success, peaking at #111 on Billboard's \"Pop Albums\" chart. The New York Times, which described the album in 1982 as \"the year's freshest dance-music album\", credited it in 1990 with having launched the \"World Beat movement in the United States\". In its review, Allmusic indicates that the album gave Adé \"unprecedented exposure on the Western market and introduced a slew of music lovers to the sounds of Afro-pop\", concluding that it \"should not only be the first-disc choice for Ade newcomers, but for the Afro-pop curious as well."

The first single was \"Casino\", which was released in June 2007. The second single was \"Tihi ubica\", released in December 2007. The single is actually a Serbian version of \"Se Esfuma Tu Amor\" (Your Love Disappears), song by Marc Anthony, which was released on his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras. For the single, Jelena filmed an accompanying music video, which is the most expensive music video released by any artist in the Balkans. The video was directed by Visual Infinity Production company, and in the video Jelena was shown as a seductive woman who stays in an old, antique hotel, named Revolution, which is actually haunted by a ghost of a man that she murdered, \"Tihi ubica\" (Silent Killer.) Since she murdered him, she was chased by FBI. It also includes scenes of Jelena laying in a red velvet bed with a doberman, riding a horse, walking through the fog on the lawn, and breaking an antique mirror with a dove flying out from the broken pieces of mirror glass."

  "text" : "Jackpot! The Best Bette (known as The Best Bette in Europe) is a compilation album of recordings by American singer Bette Midler released on September 23, 2008. The album release was originally set to coincide with Midler's current Las Vegas show, Bette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go On which debuted on February 20, 2008 at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, but was postponed to April, then August 26, and later to the actual September release. After some thirty-five years in showbusiness and having recorded some twenty albums for Atlantic Records/Warner Music and three for Columbia Records/Sony BMG, this is the second single-disc compilation of Midler's best-known recordings, following 1993/1996's Experience the Divine, and this time released by Warner Music Group's reissue subsidiary Rhino Entertainment. Jackpot! The Best Bette includes three titles from Midler's more recent albums for Columbia, \"This Ole House\", \"Tenderly\" and \"Cool Yule\", and also sees the debut of one previously unreleased track, \"Something Your Heart's Been Telling Me\", co-written by Midler, Robert Kraft and Barry Reynolds and originally cut as a demo by the singer herself in 1984 but first released by Roberta Flack who recorded the song for her 1991 album Set the Night to Music. \"My One True Friend\" and \"The Gift of Love\" were added to a later version of the CD. A 2009 reissue included three additional tracks - \"Miss Otis Regrets\", \"To Deserve You (Arif's Dance Radio Mix)\" and \"In My Life\", as well as the DVD of her 1997 HBO special Diva Las Vegas. As of November 2014, the album has sold 667,666 copies in the UK."

This album (like her previous album) also spawned two singles. Both of these singles were Top 5 Country hits. The first single, \"Fooled by a Feeling\" also peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 and on the Top 30 on the Adult Contemporary charts. The second single, \"Years\" went to #1, as well as the Top 40 on the Adult Contemporary charts. This exemplified Mandrell's new crossover style. The album was produced by Tom Collins, who helped Mandrell bring out this Pop sound onto her albums. The album became very successful. The album also included a cover of a pop tune called \"Darlin'\", also covered by Tom Jones. The album peaked at #9 on the Top Country Albums chart in 1979, as well as reaching #166 on the Billboard 200, her third album to peak on the Billboard 200."

  "text" : "Originally released in 1994, Just Say Roe was the seventh and final in the Just Say Yes series from Sire Records. It contained primarily non-album tracks of artists on the label, most of which were alternative rock, but also included some pop and dance. It was conceived specifically as a pro-choice album, put together by Sire after a letter from a listener named Todd VerBeek suggested the title and praised Sire for their willingness to address other politically sensitive issues (including freedom of expression, voter registration, and AIDS education)."

  "text" : "Journeys by DJ originated as a UK dance music record label, which started as a series of DJ mix albums or mixtapes on the Music Unites label in 1992, and moved from London to New York in 2000. Journeys by DJ was the first record label to focus exclusively on the art and format of the DJ mix, as opposed to singles, 12\" singles, artist albums and compilations. As acclaimed in the authoritative Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The Story of the Disc Jockey (Brewster/Broughton), Journeys by DJ (JDJ) was the first label to release full-length mixes of live DJ sets on CD. Other labels since the 70s released recordings of DJs spinning live, along with DJ-friendly vinyl \"megamixes\", and the 80s saw innumerable illegal mix tapes flood the market, but Journeys by DJ was the first label to set its stall out on the proposition that dance music is best heard in the mix, with high production values, and that the DJ can transcend the role of human jukebox to become a narrative artist and guide into the unknown."

  "text" : "(For the 1969 album, see Joe Cocker!) Joe Cocker is the third studio album by Joe Cocker, released in 1972 in Europe as Something to Say on Cube Records, and in the USA as Joe Cocker on A&M Records. It contains the hit single \"High Time We Went\", that was released in the summer of 1971. Joe Cocker signalled Cocker's change of direction into a more jazzy, blues style. The album reached no. 30 in the US album charts. However, although it received a positive response from the press, it made no impression on the British and European charts. It's an unusual LP among Joe Cocker albums, in that he wrote the lyrics to six songs. All of them were co-written with Chris Stainton between 1969 and 1972. Only five were written with Stainton, as \"Something To Say\" was written with Nichols. However, the album's main claim to fame might be that one of its tracks, \"Woman to Woman\", was the basis for Tupac Shakur's successful hit single \"California Love\". The album, re-titled as Something to Say, was originally released on CD in 1990 by Castle Communications and in 1998 a remastered edition of the album was released worldwide on A&M Records. Alan White, soon to be Yes' drummer, played on this album alongside Jim Keltner, after he was featured on George Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" and John Lennon's \"Live Peace in Toronto\", \"Imagine\" and \"Sometime in New-York City\" albums. Conrad Isidore played with Steve Stills and Hummingbird, among others. Percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah was known for his work with Traffic and the German band Can."

  "text" : "Just No Better Way is the second EP released by pop punk band A Change of Pace. It is the first album to include the vocals of new singer, Micah Bentley.

The album contains five new songs and acoustic versions of those songs. The EP title is a lyric from the song \"I Found Myself Today\"."

  "text" : "Just Say Yes is an album by the pop punk band Punchline, first announced in April 2008 with a release date of September 16, 2008. It is the follow-up to 37 Everywhere, released in 2006. Tracks 1-5, 7, 9 and 10 of the album were recorded at Room Sound Studios in Tempe, Arizona, with the producer Jamie Woolford (formerly of The Stereo, now a member of the band Let Go). The remaining tracks were recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O'Keefe, who previously produced Punchline's Action album. As an incentive to the first 500 who pre-ordered Just Say Yes, a four song disc titled Just Say Maybe was shipped with their order. Just Say Maybe has different versions of album songs as well as songs that were not included on the album. On November 1, Punchline gave away the album for free with some limited bonus tracks for Steve Soboslai's 28th birthday and Halloween. Just Say Yes was the first release on the independent label Modern Short Stories, founded by Soboslai."

  "text" : "Just Hits is a compilation album by American singer Bette Midler, released on the Atlantic Records label in Australia and New Zealand in 1987. The album was the third greatest hits compilation with Midler to be released in Australasia, following 1978's The Best of Bette and a second release with the same title on the K-tel label in 1981. The eighteen track Just Hits includes two titles from Midler's then most recent studio album No Frills (1983), the Rolling Stones cover \"Beast of Burden\" and \"Is It Love\", but mainly focuses on material from her 1972 debut The Divine Miss M and repertoire standards like \"Friends\", \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\", \"Do You Wanna Dance\", \"Leader of The Pack\" and \"Delta Dawn\" and the 1980 soundtrack The Rose and songs like \"When A Man Loves A Woman\", \"Stay With Me\" and the title track \"The Rose\". The compilation also, somewhat unusually, includes the last sixty seconds of the Phil Spector medley \"\"Uptown\"/\"Don't Say Nothin' Bad (About My Baby)\"/\"Da Doo Ron Ron\" from the 1973 album Bette Midler and consequently only \"Da Doo Ron Ron\". The rare single version of the 1977 track \"You're Moving Out Today\" also makes its third appearance on this compilation. The picture used for the cover of Just Hits is in fact the very same as the K-Tel version of The Best of Bette which shows Midler in concert, taken from the movie The Rose. The first Bette Midler greatest hits compilation to be released worldwide, including the US and Canada, was 1993's Experience the Divine."

  "text" : "Jefferson's Tree of Liberty is the tenth album by Jefferson Starship, released on September 2, 2008. It is the band's first studio album since 1999's Windows of Heaven. The new album includes cover songs from Irish, American, English, and Latin-American traditions. The title is a reference to Thomas Jefferson's quotation, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" The idea began in 2003 as \"The Cuba Project\", which was to include classic protest and folk songs recorded in Cuba. In 2008 the album was finally recorded but in California. About half of the songs planned for The Cuba Project were used on the final cut, with other songs coming from Jefferson Starship's previous repertoire and another project band member Paul Kantner had planned called \"On the Threshold of Fire.\" The promotional tour for the album began in late June with shows at Larkspur, California followed by tours in the US and Europe before the album's release, and continued through December 2008 with a further tour in the US and a tour in Japan. On February 1, 2009, more tour dates and venues were announced by the band's manager Michael Gaiman, with additional plans to continue the tour through 2010 and bring it to Australia and South America. David Grisman joined the band for the April 2009 tour dates. The band's promotion for the album ended in June 2009 as the band changed their set-list to Jefferson Airplane's Woodstock Festival material and started touring with the \"Heroes of Woodstock\" through the end of October."

Among the songwriters and producers on the album were successful hitmakers Rick Nowels, Ellen Shipley and Desmond Child. Due to the non-charting of her last two albums, this went unreleased in the UK and US. Rush has said that track \"Timeless Love\" is one of her favourite own songs, while fans were surprised by the closing track \"I Can't Say No\", which was a complete departure from Rush's normal output - being a contemporary dance track."

  "text" : "Jagged Edge is a 2-disc album of alternate versions and remixes of songs from the album Jagged. When Numan started recording the album Jagged he was to use Andy Gray as the producer, who previously worked on the 2-disc compilation album Hybrid. A version of \"Jagged\" and work on a track called \"Does God Bleed?\" (which eventually became \"Halo\") were the only outcomes from these session with Gray, and he eventually had to leave the project. Numan went back to Pure producers Sulpher to work on the album, and again there were delays caused by the birth of Numan's second daughter and record label politics. Because of these events, only six tracks were completed. These tracks were used for Jagged Edge along with new reworkings remixed and produced by the original album co-producer, Ade Fenton. The album was not offered on General release and available through Nuworld the Official Gary Numan website only, and due to this, Jagged Edge becomes the least selling album to date."

  "text" : "Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets with the Beatbox Alliance is a DVD released by Australian hip hop musician Joel Turner. It was Turner's first DVD release and contains live performances. The packaging also holds a copy of Turner's debut album Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets. The main feature of the DVD is a 50-minute documentary chronicling the national tour undertaken by Turner, the Modern Day Poets (MDP) and the Beatbox Alliance in early 2005. Scenes focus particularly on performances at the Melbourne International Music Festival, Newcastle University, the Byron Bay East Coast Blues and Roots Festival, and the West Coast Blues and Roots Festival, as well as the band’s attendance of the 2005 MTV Australia Video Music Awards in Sydney. Concert highlights are interspersed with behind-the-scenes footage filmed on the road and at various hotels, along with snippets from interviews with Turner, his then-manager Mark Holden, and members of MDP and the Beatbox Alliance. Some of the content from the documentary reappears in the music video for Turner’s third single “Funk U Up”, which was released in May 2005. Additional items on the DVD include music videos for the four singles lifted from Turner’s debut album, and live versions of several songs and beatboxing solos filmed at the 2005 West Coast Blues and Roots Festival in Fremantle. The DVD is supplemented with bonus features such as artist profiles, a photo gallery, and commentary on the making of the first three music videos by director Amiel Courtin-Wilson. Also included is a “Secret Section” and “Beatbox Challenge”, in which the viewer must guess a password and successfully complete an observation test in order to gain access to hidden footage."

The album originated in a daydream, in which Tom Jenkinson envisioned a rock band performing a concert against the backdrop of a large, glowing coathanger. The performance quickly became surreal: among other things, a river forces the band to kayak whilst performing; the guitarist is able to accelerate or decelerate time at will; and every drum in the drummer's kit begins to switch places with each another. As such, the majority of the album consists of Jenkinson's own version of jazz fusion, threaded through with classical guitar, math rock and funk recordings."

  "text" : "Joe's Menage is a live album by Frank Zappa, posthumously released on October 1, 2008. It contains previously unreleased material from 1975. It is the fourth album in the \"Joe's Corsage\" series, which is devoted to various rarities compiled by Joe Travers for the Zappa Family Trust. This album contains material from a concert in Williamsburg on November 1, 1975 (the middle part). It presents for the first time extensive recordings featuring vocalist and alto saxophonist Norma Jean Bell, who was only in Zappa's touring band for a brief period in late 1975. The album first germinated in 1978 when Zappa gave fan Ole Lysgaard several cassette tapes, including one of this 1975 concert. In 2004, Lysgaard sent the tapes to Gail Zappa, and she decided to release this particular dub made by Zappa. It was not possible to retrieve Zappa's original tapes, but the tape reel from which Zappa had produced the cassette dub was located in the vault. It was restored by Joe Travers and mastered by John Polito. This is Official Release #84."

  "text" : "Just Visiting is a two-part 2002 extended play series by Australian rock group, Cog. Besides vocals, it was recorded in the late 1990s. Guitar and drums were recorded at Stage Door Rehearsal Studio, in Alexandria, while bass guitar was recorded by drummer Lucius Borich, at his home on a TASCAM 8-track portastudio, before Luke Gower joined the band on bass guitar. These tracks served as demonstration recordings that had them booked for performance, and eventually signed to booking agent TPA, through Owen Orford. Frustrated at the lack of label interest, Orford, despite his lack of experience with record labels started his own to release the Just Visiting EPs, on Little Samurai Records. Just Visiting Part 1 was issued on 21 January 2002 on the MGM Distribution label, which peaked at No. 14 on the ARIA Heavy Rock & Metal Singles Chart. While Just Visiting Part 2 appeared on 1 October in that year and reached No. 4 on the same component chart. On 18 August 2008 both parts of the series were released as a single album, remastered by Borich, as Just Visiting. It contained all the tracks from both EPs, with a longer version of \"Bondi\" in place of the one released on the EP."

  "text" : "James Patrick \"Jimmy\" Page, OBE (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter, and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin. Page began his career as a studio session musician in London and, by the mid-1960s, alongside Big Jim Sullivan, was one of the most sought-after session guitarists in Britain. He was a member of the Yardbirds from 1966 to 1968. In late 1968, he founded Led Zeppelin. Page is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time. Rolling Stone magazine has described Page as \"the pontiff of power riffing\" and ranked him number 3 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". In 2010, he was ranked number two in Gibson's list of \"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\" and, in 2007, number four on Classic Rock's \"100 Wildest Guitar Heroes\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; once as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and once as a member of Led Zeppelin (1995). Page has been described by Uncut as \"rock's greatest and most mysterious guitar hero\". Los Angeles Times magazine voted Jimmy Page the 2nd greatest guitarist of all time."

It was produced, engineered and mixed by Arild Aardalen and mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios. The album continues the band's science-fiction inspired lyrical themes and the melding of 80s era melodic rock with modern power and symphonic metal. However, the tracks \"Reaper\" and \"God of War\" show the band stretching their niche in both more melodic and more metallic directions. The album also features the Iron Maiden-sounding epic \"Memento Mori\". The lyrics deal with the troubles and possibilities of souls traveling through space and time, which culminates in the closing number \"Dreamcatcher\", and the vocal line \"In my dreams I can shape the future, a journey of souls to the end...\""

The album has a definite lack of contemporary drum backing, as the band was yet to include an exclusive drummer, and relied on Field to provide the percussion with non-western instruments."

  "text" : "John B. Sebastian is the debut album by American singer/songwriter John Sebastian, previously best known as the co-founder and primary singer/songwriter of the 1960s folk-rock band the Lovin' Spoonful. The album, released in January 1970 (see 1970 in music), includes several songs that would become staples of Sebastian's live performances during the early and mid-1970s. Most notably, the album included \"She's a Lady\", Sebastian's first solo single (released in December 1968), and an alternate version of \"I Had a Dream\" which was used to open the soundtrack album of the 1970 documentary film Woodstock. John B. Sebastian also featured support performances by David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash several months before that trio agreed to work together as a performing unit. The album's release was marred by legal controversy, with two record companies, Reprise and MGM, claiming ownership of the recording and simultaneously distributing the album (with different cover artwork as illustrated, but essentially identical content) for several months in 1970. Reprise, with whom Sebastian signed as a solo artist in 1969, ultimately sued MGM, Sebastian's former distributor, for copyright infringement to settle the dispute, with the MGM release of the album subsequently withdrawn from the market. John B. Sebastian would be the artist's most successful solo album, ultimately peaking at #20 on the U.S. Billboard pop albums chart."

  "text" : "Juguemos a Cantar (Let's play singing), was a children's competition festival that was held yearly in Mexico City beginning in 1982. Televisa produced this show, and it was transmitted on the program, \"Siempre En Domingo\", which was hosted by Raúl Velasco. This competition was developed to seek out young talent, and was open to all Mexican resident children up to the age of 13. Juguemos a Cantar was first and foremost a \"Festival De La Canción\" (Festival of the Song), meaning that the songwriter and the song itself is celebrated along with the performer. All songs performed in the competition were required to be original, and the song writing is judged, as well as the artist performance. The popularity of its first transmission in 1982 made it one of the most important talent Festivals in all of Latin America. In the years it aired, it served to propel an impressive number of artists, such as: Lucero, Thalía, Edith Márquez, Eduardo Capetillo, and Lorenzo Antonio, as well as many songwriters, such as Omar Alfanno, Tirzo Paiz, Lorenzo Antonio, and Sergio Andrade."

  "text" : "Jealous Ones Still Envy 2 is the ninth solo studio album by American rapper Fat Joe, and is a sequel to his platinum-selling album Jealous Ones Still Envy (2001). It is also the third album in his Jealous One's Envy series. After several delays, the album was released on October 6, 2009. The album's production was done by Rico Love, Ron Browz, The Inkredibles, Eric Hudson, Jim Jonsin and DJ Infamous, and features guest contributions from rappers Lil Wayne, Lil' Kim, Raekwon, T.A. and Swizz Beatz and R&B singers Akon, Pleasure P and T-Pain. The album garnered a mixed reception from critics who felt it borrowed too much from current hip-hop trends to regain both commercial success and relevancy for Joe. Jealous Ones Still Envy 2 debuted at number 73 on the Billboard 200 and spawned two singles: \"One\" and \"Aloha\"."

The song was the official theme of Televisa written by Fernando Riba and Kiko Campos, produced by Bebu Silvetti and Tina Galindo. This was the \"musical pray\" of Mexico to the Pope. Due to the religious success that surprised Daniela and producers, they wanted to include it in the album Me Vuelves Loca, but PolyGram was absorbed by Universal Music Group and the inclusion was canceled."

  "text" : "Johnny Cash Country Christmas is a Christmas album and 78th overall album by American country singer Johnny Cash, released on Delta Records in 1991 (see 1991 in music), in-between Cash's contracts with Mercury Records and American Recordings. It came out in two different Versions with different cover art. It contains 15 or 13 songs, all Christmas classics and traditional holiday songs. A number of songs (such as \"Blue Christmas\", \"Silent Night\" and \"Joy to the World\") had previously been recorded by Cash - multiple times, in the case of \"Silent Night\" - for previous Christmas albums. It was also released on the LaserLight label in 1992. The 15-track version includes two additional Christmas songs, \"White Christmas\" and \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\". Four tracks do not feature Cash but instead feature vocals by his wife, June Carter Cash and the Carter Family. This was the last Johnny Cash release within his lifetime to feature the Carters, who had been a staple of his live show and studio recordings since the early 1960s, as the sisters would not participate in his subsequent work for American Recordings; nor would June Carter Cash, though a 2000 private release, Return to the Promised Land, would feature her alongside her husband. In 2006, the 13 Track Version was re-released, with 2 additional songs that had been big hits for Cash, \"Ring of Fire\" and \"I Walk the Line,\" despite neither song having anything to do with Christmas. It is unconfirmed whether these tracks are new recordings or any of the previous versions Cash recorded for Sun Records, Columbia Records or Mercury as \"I Walk the Line\" had previously been recorded for all three labels and \"Ring of Fire\" for the latter two. Most tracks had been previously recorded by Cash for one (or more) of this three prior Columbia Christmas albums, most notably Classic Christmas, though the album also includes several tracks unique to this collection such as a version of Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\" featured in the 15-track edition. \"Silent Night\" is performed on all each of Cash's four canonical Christmas albums. \"Figgy Pudding\" is an arrangement of the standard \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\" with comedic interjections by June Carter Cash, reminiscent of her country-comedy work of the 1950s and 1960s before joining with Johnny Cash. Due to this album not having any connection to the Columbia, Mercury or American labels, it is one of the more uncommon Johnny Cash releases and as of 2015 has yet to appear in any box sets or compilations."

  "text" : "John R. \"Johnny\" Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author, who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. Cash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark look, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\". He traditionally began his concerts with the simple \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash\", followed by his signature \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His best-known songs included \"I Walk the Line\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\" and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their marriage); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\" and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode."

Another reviewer describes the album as sounding like a 'French Lenny Kravitz' and notes the 'vintage 70s sound and textures'."

  "text" : "Joy is the eleventh major studio album by the American rock band Phish, released on September 8, 2009, on the band's own label, JEMP Records. The album marked Phish's return after a four-year break, and also re-united the band with producer Steve Lillywhite, who last worked with Phish on their 1996 release, Billy Breathes. Noting that 2009 marked the band's 25th anniversary together, Rolling Stone described Joy's songs as something akin to \"a belated birthday party\" characterized by nostalgic, reflective lyrics that appear to be influenced by guitarist Trey Anastasio's struggle with drug abuse during the intervening years. Rolling Stone praised the album as \"genuinely great\" and \"a deeper trip than most Phish LPs\". The first single, \"Time Turns Elastic\"—originally a multi-movement work for strings, guitar and vocals released as an album earlier in the year by Anastasio—was released for iTunes-only download on May 26, 2009. The album's second single, \"Backwards Down The Number Line\", was released on iTunes and began radio rotation on August 17, 2009. Amazon.com released an exclusive live version of \"Backwards Down the Number Line\", recorded at Red Rocks during the band's summer tour, as a download-only bonus track. All ten songs were performed live during the band's 2009 summer tour, and have been generally well received by fans. However, \"Time Turns Elastic\" has been criticized as being too overly composed for ready translation to the live stage, and the album's nostalgic ballads are sometimes thought to dampen the energy of Phish's typically acclaimed live shows."

Not only the record label had changed, also the sound of the band expanded. The first two longplayers were dominated with synthies and electro sound, the third now has ethnosounds with Fiddle, Mandolin, Tin Whistle and other. The album entered the German album charts at No. 41."

Released in 1995 (see 1995 in country music), It was his second as well as his last album under the MCA Records label. Like its predecessor, It failed to chart on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Only one track \"Please Remember Me\" was released as a single where it reached #69 on the Hot Country Songs chart. Tim McGraw would release a successful cover of the song in from his 1999 album A Place in the Sun which hit #1 in both the United States and Canada as well as reaching #10 on The Billboard Hot 100."

  "text" : "Jump the Gun is the third studio album by the Danish hard rock/heavy metal band Pretty Maids. It was released on 20 April 1990 in Europe by CBS. In the US, the title was changed to Lethal Heroes and it was released by Epic Records. The album was produced by Deep Purple's bass guitarist Roger Glover. According to CBS, it was then the most expensive album recording to date in Denmark, with a cost of around DKK 3–3.5 million. Jump the Gun was nominated for Danish Heavy Rock Album of the Year at the 1991 Danish Grammy Awards, but lost to Skagarack's A Slice of Heaven. Due to the underwhelming commercial performance of Jump the Gun, three members left the band by late 1990 leaving only the lead singer Ronnie Atkins and the guitarist Ken Hammer. The band has said on numerous occasions that the decision to hire Glover as the album's producer was a mistake and led to its over-produced sound. In 2014, Atkins called the album his least favourite. \"Hang Tough\" is a song that was written and recorded for Icon's Night of the Crime album but was not included in the final release. Icon's version is only available on the 1984: Live Bootleg CD and DVD."

Released as a 10\" LP in the UK by Vogue/Coral Records in December 1956 (#10041), it was released again in 12\" format in its US debut by Coral Records in 1957 (#57080) and in 1978 by Solid Smoke (#8001). A few years previously, there had also been an unauthorized reissue of the album which featured an exact reproduction of the cover and label, although differences in label and cover formatting noted by collectors reveal it as a reprint. In 1993, it was released on compact disc by Aris Records (MCD 30489). 1998's Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers characterizes the CD reissue as \"legendary and essential.\""

It was his only full-length solo release for more than 15 years and his only solo album with Motown. \"Love Don't Want to Leave\" has appeared on several Jackson 5 compilations (including Anthology 76, Anthology 86 and Soulsation!), but the other tracks only appeared on the 33 rpm vinyl LP, which ranks among the more obscure releases in the Jackson family catalogue. The album features background vocals from the Jackson 5 on \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\" and the B-side opener \"Do I Owe\". \"Is It Him or Me\" was sampled by Nas for his song \"War\" on his Street's Disciple album."

It’s all about feeling good and confident about yourself, and not letting anyone else tell you what you can or can't do.”", "\"But on this record it [Joy], I know what I like and I know what I want to sound like on stage. I know the things I want to do. I’m still growing and I’m still figuring it out, but at least I have my head around it a little bit more than when I was 18. So the process was easier because I’m more patient with myself. I’m not as hard on myself. I think a lot of times we get really hard on ourselves and we're like, 'Oh, this needs to be perfect!

The album was preceded by the release of the two buzz singles \"Watch Me Move\" and \"I Want You\", which were then followed-up by the three top 20 official singles \"Ghost\", \"Stuttering\" and \"Can't Breathe\", all of which have at least one music video."

  "text" : "Just a Pretty Face? is the third studio album by Finnish singer Anna Abreu, released in Finland by RCA on October 21, 2009. The album was preceded by the lead single \"Music Everywhere\" and followed by the promotional singles \"Impatient\" and \"Slam\". The album was primarily produced by Abreu's long-time collaborator Rauli Eskolin, who had been responsible for the success of her previous, dance-infused album Now. It was the first of Abreu's albums to feature the rap genre, with the song \"Capital C\" featuring a rap segment. In its first day of release alone, the album sold 23,000 copies and was certified gold, becoming one of the fastest selling records in Finnish music history. Ordinarily, the album would have reached number one in its first week. However, the same week also saw the release of two other high-profile albums and as a result, Just A Pretty Face? debuted at number three on the Finnish albums chart."

The team is an assemblage of superheroes who join together as the Justice League. The seven original members were Batman, Aquaman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The team roster has rotated throughout the years, consisting of many superheroes from the DC Universe. The Justice League received its own comic book title called Justice League of America in November 1960. With the 2011 relaunch of its titles, DC Comics released a second volume of Justice League. In July 2016, the DC Rebirth initiative relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of Justice League. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various television programs and video games and is set to appear in the 2017 film of the same name."

  "text" : "Junior Sweet (ジュニア・スウィート Junia Sūīto) is the sixth studio album by Chara, which was released on September 21, 1997. It debuted at #1 on the Japanese Oricon album charts for two weeks, and charted in the top 200 for 26 weeks. The album is Chara's most popular, and eventually sold 1,055,000 units in Japan. The album was released at the height of Chara's popularity, after starring in the movie Swallowtail Butterfly and singing the hit theme song for the movie (Swallowtail Butterfly (Ai no Uta) (あいのうた Love Song)). Her first single for this album was Yasashii Kimochi, released in April 1997. The pop song was used in a Shiseido 'Tessera J' commercial, boosting its popularity. The song was arranged by Zentarō Watanabe, member of the band Oh! Penelope. Chara had assisted on their album Milk & Cookies, released a month prior, lending her vocals to the song I Want You. The B-side to this single, Junior Sweet, was later also used for this ad campaign. The B-side later became the eponymous title track for the album, five months later. The single eventually sold more than 500,000 copies, making it Chara's second biggest single. Time Machine was used as a promotional single for the album, released a month before the album's release. It is an acoustic ballad, and was written in collaboration with Bloodthirsty Butchers vocalist Hideki Yoshimura and his former bandmate Yukio Nagoshi (when a part of the band Copass Grinderz). It reached #12 on the single charts and saw some success, but nothing rivalling Yasashii Kimochi's. Chara later covered the Bloodthirsty Butchers song Jū Ni Gatsu (12月 December) with her then husband, actor Tadanobu Asano. The song was released on a 1999 tribute album for the band, entitled We Love Butchers. A month and a half after the album was released, Milk, another acoustic ballad, was released as a re-cut single. The song was written as a collaboration between Chara and the writer of Des'ree's You Gotta Be, Ashley Ingram. Yasashii Kimochi was released with an extended introduction on the album. Junior Sweet and Watashi wa Kawaii Hito to Iwaretai (私はかわいい人といわれたい I Wanna Be Called Cute) were released as B-sides to Chara's Yasashii Kimochi and Time Machine singles, respectively. Watashi wa Kawaii Hito to Iwaretai's originally released version was 6:01 in length."

  "text" : "Jazz Impressions of Japan is a 1964 album by The Dave Brubeck Quartet. It was recorded on June 16–17, 1964 at the legendary CBS 30th Street Studio, except for \"Zen Is When\" which was recorded on January 30, 1960. It was released on August 10, 1964. The album, as the back cover of the remastered CD confirms, had been long out-of-print until it was reissued on CD in 2001, then re-released in 2008 and 2009. In the album booklet, Brubeck talks about the quartet's trip to Japan and provides poignant and interesting information for each piece of the album, explaining what inspired a certain piece, for instance. In fact, the album is a sort of trip diary. This is how Brubeck himself describes the project: \"The tunes in this album are personal impressions from the Quartet's tour of Japan, Spring 1964. No one in a brief visit can hope to absorb and comprehend all that is strange to him. Sights and sounds, exotic in their freshness, arouse the senses to a new awareness. The music we have prepared tries to convey these minute but lasting impressions, wherein the poet expects the reader to feel the scene himself as an experience. The poem suggests the feeling.\" \"Koto Song\" is the only piece from the album that became a Brubeck standard; he would record it numerous times in the following years."

(This longevity gave the album the highest charting position on the Billboard Year-End chart as an R&B Album in 1987.) It also peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on January 20, 1987. The album yielded three number-one singles on the R&B singles chart with \"Have You Ever Loved Somebody\", \"Tasty Love\" and \"Jam Tonight\". A fourth single, \"I Don't Want to Lose Your Love\", just missed the top spot, peaking at number two. The fifth single, \"Look Around\", peaked at number 69. A fourth number one single, \"A Little Bit More,\" a duet with Melba Moore was also featured as an eleventh track on some editions of the album."

  "text" : "Journey is an indie video game developed by thatgamecompany and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It was released on March 13, 2012, via the PlayStation Network. In Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience, and have since listed it as one of the greatest games of all time. Journey won several \"game of the year\" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards. A retail \"Collector's Edition\", including Journey, Thatgamecompany's two previous titles, and additional media, was released on August 28, 2012. The game was released digitally for the PlayStation 4 on July 21, 2015 and a physical edition was released on October 2, 2015."

  "text" : "Journey's Edge is a folk album, and the second solo work released in 1977 by Robin Williamson and his Merry Band. It was re-released in 2008 by Fledg'ling Records with ten bonus tracks. Journey's Edge was the beginning of a creative period for Williamson. It is the beginning of Williamson's interest with the harp, then played by Sylvia Woods, and ancient bardic poetry. These new interests would be increasingly evident in later albums and storytelling by Williamson. This is the first post Incredible String Band era album by Williamson. It is a mixture of folk, baroque, pop, and Celtic music. Tracks like \"Border Tango\" and \"Red Eye Blues\" deal with remembering and travel. It is not until the track \"Tomorrow\" that there is a sense with the future. Overall, there is a sense of emotional integrity expressed by Williamson in his vocals that give a deeper meaning to the lighthearted songs. Williamson masterfully prolonged syllables within the tracks that is reminiscent of his Incredible String Band days. The Merry Band's exceptional musicianship aid in creating the style Williamson had desired in the past. He and the troupe would tour regularly in the mid-seventies. The addition of the Celtic style and acoustic ensemble would be a trademark of Williamson and The Merry Band on further works. \"Likky Lambert\", guesting on the album, is actually former String Band member Licorice McKechnie. Her final recording appearances are on the tracks \"Tomorrow\" and \"The Bells\"."

  "text" : "Just Gets Better with Time is an 1987 album by American R&B/Soul group The Whispers. Released on April 9, 1987 on SOLAR Records, This album features their highest charting pop single, \"Rock Steady,\" which peaked inside the top 10 at number 7. The song also reached number 1 on the U.S. R&B chart. The album had four more singles released into the following year. Although none of these additional singles brought further pop success, and the first follow-up single, \"Special F/X\" only reached the UK charts (peaking at #69), the group maintained a strong presence on the R&B charts, with the album's title track reaching number 12 and \"In The Mood,\" now a quiet storm staple, charting four spots lower at number 16. The fifth and final single, 1988's \"No Pain, No Gain\" reached a dismal 74 on the R&B chart, while limping to number 81 in the UK. Despite the relative failure of the follow-ups to \"Rock Steady,\" the album itself was a strong seller; it charted high in the U.S. (number 22 on the pop charts-their second highest showing there) while reaching number three on R&B. It is RIAA-certified platinum."

The music for these albums was written during a four-year period when the group was working on a single song that was around an hour in length. Sleep had signed with London Records, which financed the album. When recording had finished, London Records was unhappy with the finished product and refused to release it. The album was later released in various forms by different record labels. All versions of the album received very positive reception from music critics, who described it as a high-water mark in both the stoner metal and doom metal genres."

  "text" : "John Otway & Wild Willy Barrett is the 1976 debut album by English folk singer-songwriter duo John Otway and Wild Willy Barrett. Released first on their own Extracked Records, the album is a collection of recordings made between 1971 and 1976. Recording began with a series of sessions at Pete Townshend's Eel Pie Studios in which The Who guitarist contributed as an arranger, producer and performer. Townshend produced the first two Track label singles by the duo, \"Murder Man\" and \"Louisa On a Horse\", which were included on the album. A third single, \"Really Free\", reached No.27 in the UK charts in December 1977 after the pair performed a set live on the BBC TV show The Old Grey Whistle Test. The performance was notable for an incident in which Otway vaulted on to a PA tower and overbalanced. The Independent reported: \"He brought down the speaker stack but fractured no bones when he landed on the sharp corner of a bass cabinet, as the impact was cushioned by his testicles.\" Polydor reissued the album after signing the band in 1977. The Allmusic website rated it seven out of 10, describing it as a patchwork collection that \"dances on a peculiar precipice somewhere between folk and country, pop and pub rock\"."

  "text" : "Jacknife is an album by American saxophonist Jackie McLean. It actually comprises two volumes, one recorded in 1965 and the other in 1966. They were originally given the catalogue number of BLP 4223 and BLP 4236, but were shelved for ten years and issued together in 1975 as a double LP, with the number BN-LA457-H2. Whilst the 1965 tracks were released on a limited edition CD in 2002, those from 1966 have never been released singularly; however, they can be found on the four-disc Mosaic compilation The Complete Blue Note 1964-66 Jackie McLean Sessions, which was limited to 5,000 copies."

  "text" : "Johnny's Greatest Hits is a compilation album by vocalist Johnny Mathis that was released by Columbia Records on March 17, 1958, and has been described as the \"original greatest-hits package\". The LP collected all but one of the songs from the first six singles he recorded, including eight A- and B-sides that made the singles charts in The Billboard (now simply known as Billboard magazine) as well as three B-sides that did not chart and one new track (\"I Look at You\") that was co-written by Mathis but not released as a single. The album made its debut on the Best Selling Pop LP's chart in the issue of The Billboard dated April 14, 1958, and eventually spent three weeks at number one. It had its last appearance there over 10 years later, in the July 20, 1968, issue, which marked its 490th non-consecutive week there, a record for the most number of weeks on the magazine's list of the most popular pop albums in the US that it held for 15 years until Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon reached 491 weeks there in the issue dated October 29, 1983. Johnny's Greatest Hits received Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 500,000 copies in June 1959, and Platinum certification for reaching the one million mark was awarded on November 1, 1999. The album was initially only available in the monaural format but was reissued in 1962 with a banner added to the original cover that read, \"Electronically Re-channeled for Stereo\". In 1977, the album was once again reissued, this time with a new jacket design that included a current and much larger headshot of Mathis. This cover was also used for its first release on compact disc in 1988 and as part of a 1995 three-disc set that included his Platinum 1959 album Heavenly and his 1984 concert album Live."

  "text" : "Jigokuhen is an LP by the Japanese noise musician Merzbow. It is the 15th and final volume of the Japanese Birds series, but is a stand-alone release. The title Jigokuhen (地獄HEN?, Hell hen) is a pun on the title of the book and film Jigokuhen (地獄変?, Hell Screen). The LP was first announced on the label's Twitter in December 2009. It was intended to be released in January 2011 to commemorate the second and first anniversaries of the releases of the first and second volumes of the 13 Japanese Birds series, but due to pressing errors it was not released until March. The first 100 copies ordered from Important are on red vinyl. An unreleased work called \"samidara1\" was played during an event at ohrenhoch in Berlin, Merzbow described it as \"using the method of several granular synthesis programs and random process of the composition.\", and referenced Graft, Chabo, Jigokuhen, and Ouroboros as having the same concept. Also released by the label on the same day was Alchemic Heart by Vampillia, which Merzbow contributes mixing and arranging on one track."

  "text" : "Johnny Mathis Sings is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released by Mercury Records on March 10, 1967 and was the last of his 11 studio projects for the label. Eight of the twelve tracks were recorded since the completion of his previous LP, So Nice, while four of the tracks were leftovers from the recording sessions for previous Mercury albums. The finished product included a number from Broadway's The Roar of the Greasepaint—the Smell of the Crowd, a cover of the Beatles hit \"Eleanor Rigby\", two offerings from songwriters Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and three cuts that originated in film scores but had lyrics added later: the melody for \"Strangers in the Night\" was written for A Man Could Get Killed; \"Somewhere My Love\" began as \"Lara's Theme\" from Doctor Zhivago; and \"Lovers in New York\" started out as the instrumental title track from Breakfast at Tiffany's. This final Mercury LP made its first appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LP's chart in the issue dated April 1 of that year and reached number 103 during its 11 weeks there. Johnny Mathis Sings was released for the first time on compact disc on December 4, 2012, as one of two albums on one CD, the second of the two being So Nice. Both were also included in Sony's Mathis box set The Complete Global Albums Collection, which was released on November 17, 2014."

The album contains both original compositions and covers of songs from the 1959 film Black Orpheus. It spawned the hit single \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\", which won the 1963 Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition. Some later pressings of the LP have the single's title displayed prominently at the top of the cover, and the album title in the box underneath. Consequently, this album is often referred to as \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind.\" \"Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus\" was released in 1983 in a half-speed mastered edition by Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs. Another remastered version was released with five bonus tracks on Fantasy Records' imprint, Original Jazz Classics label September 28, 2010."

Musically, the album drew inspiration from '80s electropop and synthpop while incorporating dance music and clear hooks. The album received positive reviews, with critics commending Amaro's production and Barracuda's lyrics, and comparing their lineup and musical style to the bands Garbage and Mecano. The singles from Jotdog, \"Hasta Contar a Mil\", \"Resistir\" and \"Las Pequeñas Cosas\", were well received by the audience. Jotdog promoted the album by performing the songs in a number of live appearances. Jotdog was re-released with a bonus DVD with additional features and received nominations for the Premios Oye! and the Latin Grammy Awards."

Released in 1968, the album continues with the sound of its predecessor Jala Jala y Boogaloo, influenced by Latin rhythms such as the Puerto Rican Jala Jala, as well as by soul and Beat music. Backed by the hit song \"Mr. Trumpet Man\", the album was an international success, being popular in the United States, Colombia, Puerto Rico and other countries. The album's success enabled the duet to sign a contract with West Side Latino records, and leave Alegre Records."

For songs “Vatra” and “Hoću da te gledam” Ana filmed extremely effective and high quality videos."

  "text" : "Joyful Jukebox Music is a compilation album by The Jackson 5 released on the Motown label in 1976. It was released after The Jackson 5 broke their contract with Motown; Michael and his brothers had already released the album The Jacksons when Joyful Jukebox Music landed in the bins. Before this break, the Jackson 5 were working hard, dozens of songs per album; Motown gathered some that had been recorded around the years 1972–1975, for recording sessions and albums: Skywriter, Get It Together, Dancing Machine and Moving Violation. Those years were very prolific for the Jackson brothers, since in addition to the aforementioned two albums and tracks, Jermaine, Michael and Jackie each had a solo album at that time (respectively Come Into My Life, Music & Me, Jackie Jackson and Forever, Michael), Tito also recorded instrumental solos. The albums Joyful Jukebox Music and Boogie were distributed for a very short period, and the album is one of the rarest albums of the Jackson 5, though not as scarce as Boogie. In 2004, it was available for a limited time from Hip-O Select, to complement Motown's 2001 \"2 Albums on 1 CD\" re-issue set of the Jackson 5's albums, on which some of these songs were issued as bonus tracks. Although only 5,000 copies were pressed, the album contains the previously unreleased full 15+ minute take of the song \"Hum Along and Dance.\" It is currently available for purchase on iTunes."

They offered him a chance to record his first studio album. Working with Yockie Suryoprayogo, he recorded Jurang Pemisah. Chrisye performed the vocals on seven songs and played the bass, Jockie played the keyboard, guitar, and drums, and provided vocals on three. Ian Antono and Teddy Sujaya played the guitar and drums respectively for the songs \"Mesin Kota\" (English: Machines in the City) and \"Dia\" (\"English: Her\"). According to Yockie, Jurang Pemisah was \"a portrait of social reality\", dealing with themes such as the environment and politics. The eponymous song, for example, was about class discrimination causing a divide between the different social strata. Another, \"Jeritan Sebrang\" (English: Shriek from the Other Side) was considered a portrait of supporters of the Republic of South Maluku. Yockie took inspiration from and blended elements of Rick Wakeman and Jon Lord to create and arrange the album. The album was released that same year with \"high hopes\", with the songs \"Jurang Pemisah\" (English: Dividing Canyon) and \"Jeritan Seberang\" planned to become singles. However, sales were lackluster. In his biography, Chrisye commented that Jurang Pemisah sold \"like chicken shit\"; warm at the beginning, but cooling off quickly.It did not receive any critical praise upon release."

  "text" : "Jazz is a music genre that originated from African American communities of New Orleans in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz spans a period of over a hundred years, encompassing a very wide range of music, making it difficult to define. Jazz makes heavy use of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation and the swing note, as well as aspects of European harmony, American popular music, the brass band tradition, and African musical elements such as blue notes and African-American styles such as ragtime. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \"one of America's original art forms\". As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed in the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines. The 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz."

  "text" : "Jacaranda is the fifth studio album from the South African American musician Trevor Rabin, released on May 8, 2012 on Varèse Sarabande. His first solo album consisting of entirely new material since Can't Look Away (1989), a gap of 23 years, Rabin started work on the album in 2007 when he began writing instrumentals that felt challenging to play that cover a variety of genres, including jazz fusion, rock, blues, classical, and bluegrass. Most of its tracks' titles reference something from Rabin's experiences while growing up in Johannesburg. Recording took place over a six-year period at Rabin's home recording studio in Los Angeles. Five musicians perform additional instruments, including drummers Lou Molino III, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Rabins' son Ryan, bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, and singer Liz Constantine. After the release date of Jacaranda was pushed back several times, the album saw a limited release which entered the U.S. Billboard charts at No. 6 under Contemporary Jazz Albums and No. 19 under Jazz Albums. Several reviewers rated the album highly, highlighting Rabin's musicical abilities and the variety of genres. Rabin cites Jacaranda as the best album of his career, and announced that a follow up with lead vocals is in development."

  "text" : "Japonesque (capitalized as JAPONESQUE) is the tenth studio album by Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda. It was released on January 25, 2012 by Rhythm Zone. It was also released just a little under a year after her 2011 album, Dejavu. Japonesque marks Koda's tenth consecutive studio album to be produced by Japanese producer and manager Max Matsuura, amongst many other producers, while she contributes to the album as the lead vocalist, background vocalist, and songwriter to majority of the songs. Recorded in Japanese with minor phrases in English language, Japonesque is a Japanese pop album with numerous musical elements such as dance music, R&B, electronica, and rock music. Japonesque was recorded in Japan and the United States, making it Koda's third studio album recorded in the latter country; Additional production and mastering was handled in the United States. Six different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a CD and DVD bundle, two separate digipak bundles, one a CD and double DVD bundle, and a digital release worldwide. Five different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; the digipak and double DVD bundle has Koda posing in a kimono, the CD and DVD has Koda sitting in a seat, whilst the CD format has her holding a cigarette holder. Upon the album's release, it was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Critics commended the album's production and praised the mixture of musical genres alongside Koda's vocals. However, the length of the material, Koda's songwriting, and the amount of musical genres were common complaints by music critics. Commercially, Japonesque was a success. It became Koda's sixth studio album to reach the top spot on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 100,000 units. The album charted on Korea's Gaon Album Chart and Taiwan's G-Music Albums Chart. Three singles were released from Japonesque, including one extended play and six promotional. The three singles; 4 Times, \"Ai o Tomenaide\", and \"Love Me Back\", performed moderately on Japan's Oricon Singles Chart whilst the latter two received certifications by RIAJ. The album tracks \"Boom Boom Boys\", \"Brave\", \"Escalate\", \"No Man's Land\", \"Slow\", and \"So Nice\" served as the album's promotional tracks with accompanying music videos. Koda promoted the album on her 2012 Japonesque concert tour."

  "text" : "Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage is a 1964 compilation album, released by Vee-Jay Records and featuring tracks by English rock band The Beatles and by the Australian-English easy listening and country singer Frank Ifield. Ifield toured the UK in 1963. While Vee-Jay Records temporarily had the US rights to a number of The Beatles' recordings, they released Jolly What! on 26 February 1964. The LP consisted of four studio Beatles songs (all previously released on Vee Jay singles), plus eight recordings of Ifield. The original pressing has a drawing of a chubby old man with a moustache and a Beatle wig, and is itself quite rare. However, just before Vee Jay's publishing rights were about to expire on 10 October 1964 they changed the sleeve cover to a drawing of the Beatles. (This version, titled The Beatles & Frank Ifield on Stage also listed all four Beatles' tracks on the front cover, but none of the eight contributed by Ifield). Probably less than one hundred copies were pressed, making it one of the rarest Beatles albums. Three sealed stereo copies were discovered in 1976, selling for $600, $900 and $1,800. One of the three was re-sold in 1995 for $22,000. Like many of the albums rushed out to cash in on the Beatles success, Jolly What! has been called a \"rip-off\", due to its intentional misleading of buyers. The album consisted entirely of studio recordings (not live, and thus not \"on stage\"), and all the Beatles material had been previously released. The album is also known for a mistake in the liner notes: \"It is with a good deal of pride and pleasure that this copulation has been presented\"—presumably \"copulation\" should have been \"compilation\". (In confirming the matter, Snopes.com noted that \"copulation\" was appropriate, since the makers of the album were \"trying to screw the fans out of their money.\") The album, however, was significant in that, until the release of the Beatles' 1973 compilation album, The Beatles/1962-1966, Jolly What! was the only American Beatles album to include \"From Me to You\"."

The album has essential participation of the renowned pianist Tigran Hamasyan, flautist Valeri Tolstov, and trumpet player Tom Duprey. It also features additional performances from Stewart Copeland and actor/musician Davis Alpay and Vincent Pedulla. This is a curious album in Tankian's discography, because only 4 of the 15 tracks features Serj's vocals. All the other tracks are instrumental, except for \"End of Time\", which features a female vocalist. According to Tankian, Jazz-Iz-Christ is \"a combination. There's some classic jazz, dance-y stuff, and progressive things. It's all over the place, but it's jazz instrument-wise. It's for a modern listener who appreciates jazz overtones.\""

  "text" : "Jahreszeiten  (\"Seasons\") is the sixth full-length release of the black metal band Nargaroth. The songs on the album don't deal with the divisions of the year, as specified by Ash: [The songs] are dealing with the seasons of love, known to nearly everybody of us. The love for an other person, which in the beginning blossoms like the spring to fully unfold in the summer, until, with the time passing, the autumn casts the first shadows and doubts, which can turn into hatred and contempt in the winter. On the vinyl version of the album, each song contains a spoken introduction. These monologues, along with the prologue are fragments from Wagner's 1996 book, \"Between the Stones\".The album contains the following dedication: Dedicated to the memory of Dr. H.-J. Koraus (18.02.1946 ~ 23.11.2007) and to Dr. M. Wernado, who inspired and escorted me on my way during the last five years, in many peaceless moments in the experiences of a man and his self-despise, and without whose help I would have never found to myself again."

  "text" : "Johnny Foreigner vs Everything is the third studio album by British indie rock band Johnny Foreigner. It was released on CD and MP3 on December 5, 2011 through Alcopop! Records, and on Double Vinyl LP in Summer 2012. The record marked their first studio album to be released without the aid of a Grammy-nominated producer (Machine producing their first record, Alex Newport producing their second); as well as their first studio album not released on Best Before Records. The album cover, as with their other albums, features drawings by Lewes Herriot. The album was assigned a Metacritic rating of 66, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". Some controversy arose when the NME website chose a writer who had already had disagreements with the band's lead singer Alexei to review the album. This writer gave the album a highly negative review and a score of 3.0/10. This was responded to with a backlash by fans and readers alike, who together used the NME's album rating system to give the album a score of 9.4/10. The double vinyl version of the album adds the Certain Songs are Cursed EP—minus the original mix of \"What Drummers Get\"—and two original songs from the (Don't) Show Us Your Fangs and You vs Everything singles."

  "text" : "Jesus Piece is the fifth studio album by American West Coast hip hop recording artist The Game, released on December 11, 2012, by DGC Records and Interscope Records, his last release on the label. Within a three-year gap between Game's third album, LAX (2008), and his follow-up, The R.E.D. Album (2011), before the latter was finally released in August 2011. The R.E.D. Album was a fall from his previous three released album sales, but became Game's third number one album on the US Billboard 200 chart. Shortly after the release of the long delayed album, Game announced he had begun work on his fifth studio album. The album was originally meant to be titled Soundtrack to Chaos, then was changed to F.I.V.E. (Fear is Victory's Evolution) and finally Jesus Piece becoming Game's first concept album. Game explained the concept of Jesus Piece does not have a spiritual theme, but it would have a \"gangster\" theme of enjoying life while also having faith in God. Jesus Piece was Game's first album since the multi-platinum selling and critically acclaimed The Documentary to feature production from Dr. Dre. Game announced on social media that every Sunday leading up to the album that he would be dropping new music, which failed to make the album's final cut. Game compared the album's quality of production and high number of guests to his mentor Dr. Dre's The Chronic 2001. \"Celebration\" was released as the album's lead single. The song features additional vocals from fellow rappers Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Tyga and Wiz Khalifa. \"Celebration\" managed to attain chart success, debuting at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"All That (Lady)\" featuring Big Sean, Lil Wayne, Fabolous and Jeremih would be released as the second single and peaked at number 48 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Other guest appearances on the album came from Meek Mill, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, Kanye West, Common, J. Cole, JMSN, King Chip, Trey Songz, Pusha T, Kendrick Lamar, Tank, K. Roosevelt, Jamie Foxx, Elijah Blake, Future and Young Jeezy. The controversial cover for the deluxe edition of the album portrays an African-American Jesus. On the standard edition cover, Game pays homage to one of his older brothers, Jevon Danell Taylor, who was shot and killed at the age of 20. Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews, with most critics praising the production and guests on the album. The album debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 86,000 copies."

  "text" : "John R. \"Johnny\" Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author, who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. Cash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark look, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\". He traditionally began his concerts with the simple \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash\", followed by his signature \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His best-known songs included \"I Walk the Line\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\" and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their marriage); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\" and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode."

Lyrically the album combines science fiction imagery, sexual themes and tributes to female movie icons. The daring (for 1973) opening track, \"Take Me I'm Yours\" is an overtly S&M fantasy...take it out on me baby, I'm ready, for your troubles I'm expedient, you're the master, come on faster, to your nature I'm obedient... Other highlights include the glamour praising, \"I'maman\" and the risque closing track, \"Blow Away\":...and all the pretty boys lay in the passage of every song that etched its way from out my bleeding heart....blow blow blow away, blow blow blow away...its very gay to blow away"

  "text" : "Jaggernaut is the seventh studio album by the band Suns of Arqa, released in 1989 by Antler/Subway Records. The album was produced by Suns of Arqa founder Michael Wadada. Although the album has never been released on CD, it was remixed by Youth, Greg Hunter and Astralasia in 1992 and released on CD under the new title 'Jaggernaut Whirling Dub'. The original Jaggernaut LP is in four parts. Side A contains the first two, which are based on ragas Bhairavi & Bhupali, and Side B contains interpretations of ragas Yaman Kalyam & Misra Pahvadi. These would later become some of the most often remixed Suns of Arqa tracks, as remixes of the album produced not only Jaggernaut Whirling Dub, but also 'Cradle' (1992) and a further remix album of 'Cradle' in 2002. The B-Sides of a later single 'Erasmus Meets The Earthling' were three tracks remixed from Jaggernaut Whirling Dub, entitled \"Whirling Dub\", \"Whirling Full\" and \"Whirling Forest\". And these re-remixes were themselves remixed further... \"Whirling Dub\" was yet again remixed by Bryn Jones for Musilimgauze and \"Whirling Forest\" was remixed for the album 'Technomor' in the late 1990s!"

The venue for the contest was announced on 10 April 2013, as the Palace \"Ukraine\". Ukrainian broadcaster National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU) was the host broadcaster for the event. It was the second time the contest was held in Kiev, the first being the 2009 contest. It was also the second time in the history of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest that the event took place in last year's winning country, as well as the first time that the event was held in the same city twice. A total of twelve countries participated, with Macedonia and Malta making a return, and Albania, Belgium and Israel choosing to withdraw. San Marino made their debut in the contest. Cyprus was originally the thirteenth country to take part but pulled out the last minute. On the evening of the contest Ruslana withdrew from appearing in the contest because of sickness. Gaia Cauchi representing Malta won the contest with the song \"The Start\". This was Malta's first Junior Eurovision victory as well as their first victory in any Eurovision Contest. It also marked the first time in the history of the contest that a winning entry was sung entirely in English. This was also the first contest to introduce a new awards system: The winning country along with the second and third place countries each received a trophy. Sofia Tarasova, representing the host nation Ukraine, took second place and Ilya Volkov singing for Belarus took the third-place trophy."

The only resulting album, Way Down Below Buffalo Hell, reflects the contradictory variety of influences of those involved, with a mix of roots, pop and ambient trance-dance tracks. Jam Nation includes contributions from various artists including Ayub Ogada, Alex Gifford, Justin Adams, Jah Wobble, Caroline Lavelle, Jane Siberry, Justin Adams, Jocelyn Pook, Daniel Lanois, Billy Cobham, David Rhodes, Karl Wallinger and the late Lucky Dube among many others."

The final took place on 15 November 2014 and was in the Malta Shipbuilding in Marsa, near Valletta. Moira Delia, a Maltese television personality, hosted the show, marking the first time in Junior Eurovision history that there was only one presenter of the show. A total of sixteen countries participated, with Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia making their débuts. The winner of the contest was Vincenzo Cantiello, who represented Italy with the song \"Tu primo grande amore\". Bulgaria and Armenia finished in second and third place, respectively. This was Italy's first victory in a Eurovision competition since the last edition of Jeux Sans Frontières in 1999, and also marked the first time since the inaugural 2003 contest that a country had won in its débutante year."

Theme of the album is music of the Crusades, the central event of the medieval history. Heroic feats in the Holy Land, laments over one's master's death, longing for the beloved in the homeland – became favourite subjects of medieval lyrical, poetry. Some of the famous master-poets themselves touched the soil of the Holy City of Jerusalem. In this recording the Ensemble Renaissance follows in their footsteps. This representative selection of the most famous pieces of medieval poetry and music from the age of the Crusaders and their journeys to Jerusalem, is at the same time a story of how the crusaders sang, what their topics were, what their joys were, whom they lamented, or dreamed, to what music they danced."

The Justice League received its own comic book title called Justice League of America in November 1960. With the 2011 relaunch of its titles, DC Comics released a second volume of Justice League. In July 2016, the DC Rebirth initiative relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of Justice League. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various television programs and video games and is set to appear in the 2017 film of the same name."

  "text" : "Jurrassic Exxplosion Phillipic or The Jurrasic Explosion Philippic is the debut album by Foxygen, which \"self-produced a string of adventurous records throughout high school.\" Jonathan Rado described the album to Interview Magazine as a \"30 track space opera.\" It was initially released in 2007, but then a further release of a free download link was shown by Foxygen on social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter. It was recorded when the band members were 15 years old. We were babies. Neither one of us had hit puberty yet. Our voices were extremely high.AL: When you played shows back when you were in High School, did you have a driver’s license, or did your parents have to drive you to shows?Sam: Yeah. We played at the Whisky a-go-go a few times. Most of our shows were at school. It would be some class show where we would fuck around on melodica and guitar. Our early influences were Brian Jonestown Massacre. We watched Dig The Movie every day. We were into the fact that Anton “played everything.” We wanted to play everything. So I went on Ebay and bought every strange instrument. I would buy an accordion or a xylophone. We would bring them to shows and we couldn’t really play any of them. But it worked for some reason. We tried to get a sitar for a long time."

  "text" : "J.A.C.K. is the third studio album by American pop punk band Forever the Sickest Kids. It is their first release through Fearless Records since their former label, Universal Motown, was shut down and is also the first release to not feature keyboardist Kent Garrison and lead guitarist Marc Stewart. The album was produced by Mike Green and was released on June 25, 2013. With the departure of their past members and the label switch, the album reflects how the remaining members of the band came together and made positive changes when they were faced with negative challenges in their career and lives. Unlike their previous album, which featured numerous producers and co-writers outside of the band, the majority of the songs on J.A.C.K. were written solely by the members of the band. Mike Green was the main producer for the album, marking the first time the band had ever worked with only one producer for any of their releases. Lyrically, the album deals with relationships, growing up, self-examination, the importance and values of friendship, stereotypes of America, and staying true to oneself. Like all of their songs, the lyrics are based on the band members' personal lives and experiences."

  "text" : "The Justice League, also known as the Justice League of America (JLA), is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The Justice League was conceived by writer Gardner Fox, and first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #28 (March 1960). The team is an assemblage of superheroes who join together as the Justice League. The seven original members were Batman, Aquaman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The team roster has rotated throughout the years, consisting of many superheroes from the DC Universe. The Justice League received its own comic book title called Justice League of America in November 1960. With the 2011 relaunch of its titles, DC Comics released a second volume of Justice League. In July 2016, the DC Rebirth initiative relaunched the Justice League comic book titles with the third volume of Justice League. Since its inception, the team has been featured in various television programs and video games and is set to appear in the 2017 film of the same name."

The single \"Il est cinq heures, Paris s'éveille\" was number one on the French charts for one week, from 23 March 1968.

  "text" : "John Sebastian Live is a recording of a July 1970 concert performance by American singer/songwriter John Sebastian, released in September of that year by MGM Records. The album is noteworthy as it was only available for sale for about two months in 1970, making it a relative rarity in Sebastian's catalog. MGM, for whom Sebastian had recorded (via a distribution arrangement with Kama Sutra Records) as a member of the Lovin' Spoonful during 1965-68, released the album after Sebastian had left MGM/Kama Sutra to sign with Warner Bros. Records' Reprise Records subsidiary as a solo artist. Contending that Sebastian still owed them an album according to the terms of his Lovin' Spoonful contract, MGM released both Sebastian's debut solo album John B. Sebastian and John Sebastian Live during 1970 without authorization from Sebastian or his management. Warner Bros. Records sued MGM for copyright infringement following MGM's release of John B. Sebastian (which Warner/Reprise had already issued in January 1970), ultimately resulting in MGM's pulling their releases of the two Sebastian albums from the market. John Sebastian Live has not been reissued by any record label since it was withdrawn by MGM in late 1970. Despite its limited release, John Sebastian Live briefly placed on the U.S. Billboard Top LPs chart, peaking at #129."

Side one of the disc consists of two vocal compositions sung in Bengali, of which the title track was a message of unity to the newly independent nation, formerly known as East Pakistan. The third selection is a duet by Shankar and sarodya Ali Akbar Khan, supported by Alla Rakha on tabla, a performance that presaged their opening set at the Concert for Bangladesh. Joi Bangla was the first of four Shankar-related releases on the Beatles' Apple label, closely followed by the Raga soundtrack album. The EP has been out of print since soon after its release. Of the three tracks, only \"Oh Bhaugowan\" has been reissued – on the Harrison-compiled Ravi Shankar: In Celebration box set (1996)."

  "text" : "Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981)is an American singer, songwriter, actor and record producer. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his debut solo album, the R&B-focused Justified (2002), which included the successful singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\", and earned his first two Grammy Awards. His critically acclaimed second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), characterized by its wide range of musical influences, debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\", and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". With his first two albums exceeding sales of 10 million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers of the decade. He also has collaborated with other artists, including \"Give It to Me\" (with Timbaland) and \"4 Minutes\" (with Madonna). From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time, and Friends with Benefits. Timberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2, exploring neo soul styles with the song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling album of the year in the US with the largest sales week, and spawned the top-three singles \"Suit & Tie\" and \"Mirrors\", while the latter produced the top-ten song \"Not a Bad Thing\". They were supported by The 20/20 Experience World Tour, which originated the concert film Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids, named after the accompanying band in his live performances. In 2016, Timberlake will voice the lead character in DreamWorks Animation's Trolls, which soundtrack includes his fifth Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\". Timberlake's work has earned him numerous awards and accolades, including nine Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, and four Emmy Awards, the latter being for his appearances on Saturday Night Live. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007 and 2013. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality."

  "text" : "Journals is the second compilation album by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. The album was only released digitally through online platforms, such as iTunes, on December 23, 2013 by Island Records. A ten-week digital download campaign entitled Music Mondays, in which one new song was released every Monday night, was held from October 7, 2013 to December 9, 2013. In addition to the songs released on \"Music Mondays\", Journals is also composed of other five previously unreleased songs. The recording sessions took place between 2012 and 2013, while the singer was on his Believe Tour, which generated one or two songs a day throughout the entire tour. To achieve a more mature sound, Journals sees Bieber working with a variety of different R&B producers, such as The Audibles, Jason \"Poo Bear\" Boyd, Andre Harris, D.K. the Punisher, Soundz, Chef Tone, T-Minus, as well as his previous producers Maejor Ali, Diplo, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and Sir Nolan, while collaborating with R&B and hip-hop artists and rappers, such as Future, R. Kelly, Chance the Rapper, Big Sean and Lil Wayne. An R&B and soul album with pop influences, Journals mostly deals with themes of heartbreak and forgiveness in a romantic relationship. It was suggested that Bieber's relationship with former girlfriend, actress and singer Selena Gomez, was the main inspiration for the majority of the album. The album was supported with the release of ten singles, with two of them receiving music video treatment. The album was met with lukewarm reviews from music critics. Although some praised its mature direction and labeled it his best material, others felt dismissed its similar themes and \"unfinished\" production. Despite promotions of the album that helped Bieber reach number one on the Social 50 chart and the release planned to capitalize the sales rush before Christmas, the album was not submitted for sales tracking to SoundScan, thus it did not chart on the Billboard 200 due to its first week sales going unreported. In reached the top-forty in some countries and debuting in the top 10 only in Denmark and Norway. The compilation was meant to be released physically, but due to the label not supporting Bieber's sound's choices, they did not support the album project. It was, however, eventually released on LP in 2016."

The purely instrumental album features Secret Garden playing some of their most popular songs re-envisioned as duo arrangements along with two new pieces: the title-track “Just the Two of Us” and “En Passant”. Rolf Løvland described the album, “Our music always starts with just the two of us – Rolf & Fionnuala; even when we’re performing with a full production on stage. So it feels natural and good to perform some of our music in the most intimate and stripped-down version – that musical place where Secret Garden was born.” The album debuted at number seven on the Billboard Top New Age Albums chart."

  "text" : "Joseph \"Joe\" Satriani (born July 15, 1956) is an American instrumental rock guitarist and multi-instrumentalist. Early in his career, Satriani worked as a guitar instructor, with many of his former students achieving fame, such as Steve Vai, Larry LaLonde, Rick Hunolt, Kirk Hammett, Andy Timmons, Charlie Hunter, Kevin Cadogan, and Alex Skolnick; he then went on to have a successful solo music career. He is a 15-time Grammy Award nominee and has sold over 10 million albums, making him the biggest-selling instrumental rock guitarist of all time. In 1988, Satriani was recruited by Mick Jagger as lead guitarist for his first solo tour. Satriani briefly toured with Deep Purple as the lead guitarist, joining shortly after the departure of Ritchie Blackmore in November 1993. He has worked with a range of guitarists during the G3 tour, which he founded in 1995. His G3 collaborators have included Vai, LaLonde, Timmons, Steve Lukather, John Petrucci, Eric Johnson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Brian May, Patrick Rondat, Paul Gilbert, Adrian Legg, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Steve Morse and Robert Fripp. Satriani has been the guitarist for the supergroup Chickenfoot since joining the band in 2008."

It is the duo's first full-length album since Zephyr in 2009, and was announced on 19 May 2014. The title is taken from the song \"Power to the People\". The album sees a stylistic return to the duo's house roots and away from the more pop and dance-influenced sound of their previous few records. The album earned mostly positive reviews upon release, holding an aggregate 71 out of 100 on Metacritic. It reached into the top 30 of the UK Albums Chart, among charting in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Japan, South Korea and on the United States Billboard charts. Junto spawned five singles, which were \"Back 2 the Wild\", \"What a Difference Your Love Makes\", \"Unicorn\", \"Never Say Never\" and \"Galactical\", with \"Never Say Never\" being a topper of the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart."

  "text" : "Journey to Freedom is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Michelle Williams, released on September 9, 2014 by E1 Music and Light Records. It marked her first release under the label after severing professional ties with longtime record company Columbia Records and manager Mathew Knowles in 2009. Following a hiatus from her recording career, Williams' album, a collaboration with main producer Harmony Samuels, was a fusion of both urban contemporary gospel and R&B sounds. The album was also preceded by the release of the lead single, \"If We Had Your Eyes\" which peaked in the top-twenty of the US Adult R&B Songs chart. A third single, \"Say Yes\", reunited Williams with her former Destiny's Child band mates Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Gospel Songs chart. To further promote the album, Williams went on a tour in the United States. The album was nominated for Outstanding Gospel Album (Traditional or Contemporary) at the 46th NAACP Image Awards and earned Williams four nominations at the 30th annual Stellar Awards."

  "text" : "Jigarthanda (English: Cold Heart) is a 2014 Indian Tamil black comedy-musical gangster film written and directed by Karthik Subbaraj. Produced by Kathiresan's Group Company, it features Siddharth, Bobby Simha and Lakshmi Menon in the lead, while the supporting cast includes Nassar, Ambika, Karunakaran and Sangili Murugan. Gavemic U Ary was the film's cinematographer, making his debut in Tamil cinema, and Vivek Harshan was the film's editor. Santhosh Narayanan composed the songs and background score. The film was produced under Kathiresan's production banner, Group company. It also won two National Film Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Bobby Simha) and Best Editing (Vivek Harshan). The plot revolves around Karthik (Siddharth), an assistant director who is thrown out of a reality new filmmakers show, as his short film was disappointing. Heartbroken, Karthik has the support of one of the judges (Aadukalam Naren) who believes he has the stuff to be a great director and is willing to back him if he does a script on a real life gangster. Karthik travels to Madurai looking to make a film based on the life and times of the notorious gangster Assault Sethu (Bobby Simha). The rest of the plot deals with how Karthik makes his film with the help of his friend Oorani (Karunakaran). The shoot of the film, entirely held in Madurai, started on 12 June 2013  and was completed after five months on 21 November 2013. Jigarthanda released on 1 August 2014 worldwide to critical acclaim from critics as well as audience who appreciated the film's script, performances, cinematography and music. The film was deemed as one of the most technically brilliant films in Tamil Cinema. The film was also dubbed into Telugu as Chikkadu Dorakadu, becoming Siddharth's first Telugu release in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh post their bifurcation. It was remade in Kannada with the same title in 2016 which was produced by actor Sudeep. The film completed 50 days at the box office, and was declared a \"Hit\" after it grossed ₹35 crore (US$5.2 million) against a budget of ₹10 crore (US$1.5 million)."

  "text" : "Jesus East is the second album by Melbourne electronica band Black Cab, released in 2006. The album was described as \"sitar-drenched, blending Indian instruments (looped and droning) with driving rock’n’roll and country guitar stylings\". Band member Andrew Coates explained: \"The album's two musical signposts are the Beatles' sitar-drenched \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and German Krautrock duo Neu!. We kind of had this theme which was George Harrison goes to an ashram in India and comes back to Germany via the autobahn. It really was the rough idea of what we were trying to do music-wise, and everything came from there.\" The album included a spoken-word section by former Rolling Stones tour manager Sam Cutler, whose voice had also appeared on the band's previous album, Altamont Diary in soundbites taken from a documentary film about the ill-fated 1969 free concert at Altamont Speedway in California headlined by the Stones. \"You have to remember we were 'celebrating' the biggest bummer of his life, a period he’d consigned to history,\" band member Andrew Coates told the mess+noise website. \"But he was coming down to Victoria for the Rainbow Serpent festival so we arranged to meet up.\" Cutler agreed to contribute a spoken-word piece to the Jesus East album, which was then in production. \"It was like a bad interview,\" guitarist James Lee recalled. \"We were coaxing him, but it was going nowhere. So we put the backing track loops on, gave him the mic again, and he did it all in one take.\" Mess+noise reported: \"The result was 'Valiant', the second-last track on Jesus East. In it, Cutler—now in his mid-60s—reminisces about the glory days of the Grateful Dead entourage (famously known as 'Deadheads'): their unity, sense of shared spirit and open-mindedness. He also expresses his disillusion about today’s music scene. 'Nowadays, it doesn’t feel to me like there’s that community of spirit when I go to music shows. For a start, everyone’s doing different drugs,' he laments. Towards the end of the piece Cutler advises 'young people today' to 'go for what is real ... look at your own heart and your own spirit ... follow your own master'. The song polarises Cab fans, says Coates. 'Some people really hate that song, some geezer raving about the Grateful Dead ... They’re like, 'Who is he?' \""

  "text" : "John Wick is a 2014 American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, and starring Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe. The film stars Reeves as John Wick, a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the theft of his vintage car and the killing of his puppy, a gift from his recently deceased wife. Stahelski and Leitch directed the film together, though Leitch was uncredited. The film was written by Derek Kolstad, who completed the screenplay in 2012 and further developed it for Thunder Road Pictures. The film was produced by Basil Iwanyk of Thunder Road Pictures, Leitch, Eva Longoria and Michael Witherill. It marks Stahelski and Leitch's directorial debut as a team after multiple separate credits as second unit directors and stunt coordinators. They previously worked with Reeves as stunt doubles on The Matrix trilogy. Stahelski and Leitch's approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for anime and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and gun fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was additionally influential in the development of the film. The film also pays homage to works such as John Woo's The Killer, Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge and Le Samouraï, John Boorman's Point Blank, and the spaghetti western subgenre of Western films. The film was acclaimed by critics, who praised the performances, visuals and action sequences, and called it a welcome return to form for Reeves. A sequel, titled John Wick: Chapter 2, is currently in production and is scheduled to be released on February 10, 2017."

  "text" : "Julekonserten was a Norwegian Christmas concert which was held every year between 1989 and 1999. Julekonserten toured in Scandinavia, and visited cities in Norway, Sweden and Denmark with a mix of Scandinavian artists. The long list of artists and performers includes Sissel Kyrkjebø, The Chieftains, Oslo Gospel Choir, Triple & Touch, Rune Larsen, Tor Endresen and Kurt Ravn. Every year Julekonserten (the concerts in Oslo and Gjøvik) was also broadcast on Television in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Stageway AS arranged these concerts and a part of the money went to aid children on the street in La Paz and Santa Cruz in Bolivia. Two CDs were released from their concerts, Julekonserten (1996) and Julekonserten 10 år (1999)."
