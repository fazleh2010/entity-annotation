  "text" : "30 Hudson Street, also known as Goldman Sachs Tower, is a 238 m (781 ft), 42-story building in Jersey City, New Jersey. It is the tallest building in New Jersey. Completed in 2004, the tower was designed by Cesar Pelli. It houses offices, a cafeteria, a health unit, and a full-service fitness facility including a physical therapy clinic. Provident Bank of New Jersey and Così outlets are also located on the ground level, and open to the general public. The building is in the Exchange Place area close to a PATH station and is accessible by the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail at the Essex Street and Exchange Place stops. The tower sits on the waterfront overlooking the Hudson River and Lower Manhattan and is visible from all five of the New York City boroughs. On a clear day, the building may be visible from as far away as Highlands, New Jersey 40 miles south and Bear Mountain, New York 48 miles north. Originally intended to be a dedicated use building for Goldman Sachs' middle and back office units, lower than projected staffing levels at the bank following the global financial crisis forced Goldman to seek occupancy from other tenants to avoid forgone rental income. Royal Bank of Canada currently shares the space, with plans for other professional service firms to take occupancy as well in the near future."

  "text" : "(Not to be confused with Jewelers Building (1882).) 35 East Wacker, also known as the Jewelers' Building, is a 40-story 159.4 m (523 ft) historic building in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States, located at the intersections of Wabash Avenue, and facing the Chicago River. It was built from 1925 to 1927, and was co-designed by Joachim G. Giaver and Frederick P. Dinkelberg. It was once considered to be the tallest building in the world outside of New York City. Formerly the Pure Oil Building and North American Life Insurance Building, 35 East Wacker was listed in 1978 as a contributing property to the Michigan–Wacker Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places, and was designated a Chicago Landmark on February 9, 1994. For its first 14 years, the building had parking on the lower 23 floors with a car lift that facilitated safe transfers for jewelry merchants. Currently, the French-American Chamber of Commerce in Chicago is a tenant, and the showroom of architect Helmut Jahn is atop the building inside the dome, which was originally a restaurant. The building is currently being renovated, with the facade being maintained, but the interiors converted into a more modern configuration. Both the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects and the City of Chicago have recognized the renovation project with awards."
