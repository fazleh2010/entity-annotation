  "text" : "The 7 Subway Extension is a subway extension of the New York City Subway's IRT Flushing Line. The extension stretches 1 mile (1.6 km) southwest from its previous terminus at Times Square, at Seventh Avenue and 41st Street, to one new station at 34th Street and Eleventh Avenue. A second station at 10th Avenue and 41st Street was dropped from the plans in October 2007. The entirety of the extension is located within the New York City borough of Manhattan and is served by the 7 local and <7> express services. The extension, a key part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, is expected to bring business and entertainment into the area, as well as aid redevelopment of nearby Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen, located around the Long Island Rail Road's West Side Yard. The extension also serves the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The project was originally proposed in 2005 as part of the Hudson Yards project, which included the failed attempt to build the West Side Stadium for the New York Jets and the city's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Although the stadium plan was rejected by the state legislature, the rest of the Hudson Yards, including the 7 subway extension plan went forward. Construction on the extension started in 2007. The extension's opening was pushed back multiple times from its original target of December 2013. The delays were attributed to a variety of problems, mostly involving the 170-foot-long (52 m) incline elevators that were custom-designed for the new station. The extension finally opened to the public on September 13, 2015."

In its heyday, 70 Mile House was a frequent stop for stagecoaches, such as the ones run by Barnard's Express and for Cataline's mule train."

  "text" : "The 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry Monument is an 1891 statuary memorial on the Gettysburg Battlefield. It is located on Cemetery Ridge, by The Angle and the copse of trees, where Union forces – including the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry – beat back Confederate forces engaged in Pickett's Charge. The monument was the subject of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court case over control of the battlefield. It is depicted on the 2011 \"Gettysburg\" America the Beautiful quarter commemorative coin. The regiment erected an earlier monument in 1883. To avoid confusion, that is now usually referred to as the \"Philadelphia Brigade\" Monument."
